indices profilearcus investment4 years of ferreting out neglected value in japanese equities hamlin lovellfirst published  jul  event  leading women in hedge funds  commentary canada if you are not afraid of holding japanese government bonds and cash then abenomics isn’t workingpeter tasker arcus investment having a market surge  within a few months is bound to attract attention and arcus has been enjoying japan’s sudden return to the limelight after so many years of obscurity “you cannot underestimate just how anomalous japan’s twodecade bear market is” says ceo robert macrae abenomicsthe catalyst for all the excitement is abenomics the new policy environment initiated by prime minister abe “i’ve been waiting for this for  years” says japan veteran and strategist peter tasker perhaps the only manga japanese comic magazine discussion of japan’s policy options his “i am a digital cat” anticipated several ingredients of abenomics notably that japan’s hard money policy had to come to an end arcus is not forecasting specific levels for the yen exchange rate or even calling it down but at  yen per dollar the impact on the real economy is enough to end the vicious feedback loop whereby a strong currency reinforces deflationary pressures exacerbates economic weakness and encourages ever more excessive saving at current currency levels tasker is “confident abenomics will support the corporate profit cycle for at least two years and that profits will rise to new highs” he adds “if you are not afraid of holding japanese government bonds jgbs and cash then abenomics isn’t working” hinting that a “great rotation” from bonds to equities could be on the cards one reason that abenomics marks such a sea change for japanese equities according to arcus is that companies had been making much more progress over the last decade than was generally recognised by investors “in contrast to the s corporate fundamentals have been improving for the last decade” says tokyo representative mark pearson japanese companies have generated strong earnings growth between  and   annualised for topix while tse second section has done twice as well he says many people focus on the negative aspects of japan high debt demographics and deflation but we invest in companies which have been growing profits in the past decade even as gdp contracted and the population aged” notes pearson tasker adds “the surprise is not so much that the market reached  but that this took so long after the recovery in corporate profits twentytwo years after the topix peak the index was flirting with new lows and indeed trading below its year moving average” no other market in the world has offered such dismal returns for such an extended period and as investors have lost interest the level of investor attention has become apathetically low so that real improvements were overlooked for a long time with expectations so subdued and abenomics as a trigger – the consequent bounce was naturally sharp inefficiencyjapan is one of the most neglected and inefficient markets in the world with a fraction of the analyst coverage of even that of emerging markets that’s fine by us as we go directly to the companies to learn about their businesses says pearson market inefficiency creates opportunities for stockpickers like arcus particularly when their market experience dates back to the s “mark has visited more than half the 4 companies in japan there may be noone else in the world who has done that” says macrae arcus just do japan all funds are managed from london but the research team of pearson and analysts nick brooks and takaaki haruki are based in tokyo where they typically make two company visits a day conducted in japanese arcus initiates almost one new position after every two meetings getting this high hit rate by concentrating the visits on companies where – so long as numbers stand up and there are no surprises – the value decision is very clear “we are a value manager focusing mainly on the earnings stream that companies can generate probably what distinguishes us most is the extent to which we focus solely on value and the aggression with which we implement” says macrae ranking on simple value ratios is a first step to identify potentially cheaper companies but exauditor brooks cautions that a proper valuation requires substantial adjustments as japanese accounting certainly has its peculiarities after years of deflation book values may need adjusting and offbalancesheet pension liabilities can be another quirk of japanese accounting however compared with us accounting in particular earnings tend to be a much more realistic measure of the increase in shareholder value the longevity and cohesion of the arcus team is clear “with the honourable addition of nick we are the same team that set up in ” says macrae arcus’s investment principles have also remained remarkably consistent over time with a strong value emphasis ensuring that the team are always searching in areas that most investors ignore or actively dislike and usually taking a two to threeyear perspective “what is cheap changes over time” notes brooks for most of the postcrisis period the value numbercrunching increasingly indicated that shorting expensive defensives and owning cheap cyclicals was the best trade probably due to the fashion for “low volatility” stocks now following the rally more of the higherquality companies are offering better value and the market appears more balanced however as value is a much overused and abused term the team see their track record warts and all as giving investors a more practical idea what they can expect with a performance history this long you can see the conditions in which they do well and badly notes macrae noone enjoys losing money and it is always tempting to hope that lessons have been learned and that it isn’t going to happen again – but this seems unwise “our trade is always sensibly contrarian” says pearson and betting against the market always carries the risk that you are wrong historyarcus was born in  its three founders were robert macrae a quant value specialist mark pearson a stock picker and peter tasker an awardwinning sellside strategist at kleinwort benson from their differing perspectives all agreed that japan offered fertile ground for value investing they raised domestic assets via local broker universal securities who gathered the best part of a billion dollars of assets in the early years unfortunately the bearmarket mentality already deeply ingrained in the local investor psyche made the japanese rigorous sellers of winners and so turnover was high as investors took profits dayone investors in the arcus japan long short fund ajlsf a ucits have now almost quadrupled their money since april  from  arcus sought out stickier investors overseas making the strategy available as cayman fund zensen both funds are serial winners of the hedge fund journal’s europe  and ucits hedge performance awards arcus also run longonly funds that have generated substantial absolute returns as well as beating benchmarks by an impressive margin the mid and large capfocused arcus japan fund a luxembourg ucits has made 4 since  in contrast to the horizontal journey made by the topix index “we have been able to pick undervalued successful companies that have allowed our funds to perform even if the market did not” is pearson’s explanation overall arcus’s midlargecap longonly strategy stitching this together with the earlier leaders fund has delivered annual outperformance of  since september  the highly specialist small and microcap vehicle arcus japan value fund ajvf has outpaced the topix by almost  a year since december  half the positions in this fund are below  million market cap demanding a mandatory  monthly gate and restricting its appeal mostly to families and highnetworths the new genseki fund is a more conventional smallcap fund aiming at a wider audience by offering day liquidity while arcus aims to outperform over periods of a few years it is perfectly frank about some spells of underperformance the climax of the tmt bubble in  was naturally tough time for any value investor and ajlsf lost  this was recovered as the bubble burst and fundamentals reasserted themselves allowing for strong performance during the  bear market and for a great   however was another weak period at least in relative terms when japan experienced a smallcap bubble as many foreign funds tried to invest unmanageable amounts into smaller stocks  was also very difficult with investor fears rising to unprecedented levels at the time “prices were discounting such a severe depression that multiyear losses would destroy most of book value and a meaningful fraction of listed companies would go bankrupt” notes pearson and arcus was as usual too early to argue that the world was not going to end as arcus wrote in a  investor circular two days before the lehman insolvency “to be quite clear on what these numbers mean to us ajvf on pe x pb x and ajf on x and x are simply the cheapest and most attractive that we have ever seen” though it gave investors a rough ride this aggressive approach did very well as fears started to recede over the following months opportunitiesfastforward from the crisis through the neglected but profitable years of  and we come back to abenomics how is the new environment going to drive returns earnings may be the fundamental driver for stocks but somehow the cash generated has to be returned to shareholders “the prevailing wisdom has long seen japanese companies as chronically unprofitable and scandalously antishareholder” notes pearson “but we expect continued substantial earnings growth accompanied by increasing dividends and share buybacks” with so much of arcuss long portfolio trading on singledigit pe multiples and also looking good on other metrics such as cashflow yields and dividend yields there is clearly scope for multiple expansion while arcus very seldom invests in pure asset plays preferring to see evidence that assets are being used profitably many companies in the arcus portfolios have net cash as opposed to net debt this speaks to another potential booster for share prices after years of deleveraging even a marginal move towards releveraging corporate balance sheets could translate into a transformational increase in returns on equity and there are plenty more opportunities available over 4 companies still trade below net cash and half of the market trades below book value more than any other developed market corporate activitycorporate activity is another way to unlock this value and since  no fewer than  arcus holdings have been taken over bought out or subject to other valueenhancing corporate activity “we have felt for some time that japan is a market ripe for activism again and that our value style would benefit” opines pearson the first  wave of activists may have beat their retreat but their legacy is that it has become unacceptable for predators to squeeze out minorities without offering a decent price and premia are typically substantial softbank’s recent takeover of eaccess stands out for the  premium paid but even so is widely seen as a good buy for softbank the economic rationale for domestic activism is clear and the trend is clearly rising both in numbers and in the sizes of the companies involved many of arcuss cheap holdings are natural targets third point’s interest in sony suggests a second wave of foreign interest is beginning sony was a topfive pick for arcus back in february and an example of how even stocks that are reasonably well analysed can be very undervalued by japanese standards sony is well researched with  sellside analysts following the stock but only one of these had a buy rating on the company when arcus bought it at half of book value now that new york manager dan loeb has written a well publicised letter to the company its potential is becoming widely understood the lossmaking televisions division has masked the strong profitability of other units such as music films and insurance loeb’s letter suggests a modest and achievable restructuring that will prove hard to ignore and could unlock substantial value loeb has added to his stake after the market pullback reflationif abenomics can reignite economic growth and persuade thrifty consumers to stuff less of their earnings into their vast piggybanks brooks points out that this will be gamechanging for many stocks looking at the real estate for example renting property currently costs nearly three times as much as buying even with a fixedrate mortgage but people are not rushing to buy because based on the experience of over  years they expect further falls in house prices if property prices merely stop falling for a period then buying instead of renting becomes a rational decision even if property prices doubled buying would still be cheaper than renting rising real estate prices should have a powerful wealth effect encouraging construction and consumption arcuss preferred stock in the sector nisshin fudosan is an apartment builder that even after shooting up  since arcus bought trades well below book value – and holds substantial net cash this has allowed it to ride out the  years of deflation and benefit from being one of the few survivors and still provides substantial security if the investment thesis – as has often been the case in japan – takes longer than expected to play out by contrast the consensus trade appears to be to buy the iconic real estate stocks and arcus are short several as the sharp rises has moved them far beyond book value even considering any likely gains “is it ever smart to pay more than one dollar for real estate that is worth one dollar” asks macrae suspicion of thematic investing shorting companies priced for perfection and buying neglected value are all arcus trademarks the same philosophy applies in the retail sector uniqlo the owner fast retailing doubled in a matter of months helped by being the largest constituent of the sharepriceweighted nikkei index and encouraging arcus to short it at the same time other retailers started looking like the cinderellas of the rally languishing on fears that a weaker yen would increase the cost of their imported inputs however there are signs of a sea change in consumer sentiment and nascent pricing power for producers apple has recently imposed a  price rise on its products and as other importers follow suit attitudes will change typically arcus has profited from a revival in discretionary spending in less trodden areas buying for example unique niche retailer komehyo that recycles gifts given to geisha girls and hostesses arcus also sees value in japan’s answer to ikea nitori this bottomup approach to identifying earnings power creates a highly individual portfolio looking to the futuresimilar examples exist in most sectors with stocks in great niches but totally unknown to most investors and with so many interesting opportunities it might be natural to get carried away with arcus however this does not seem likely as they have always taken a slow and cautious approach particularly on capacity after the good performance of  hardclosed in 4 with  million staying shut until  because macrae argues studies suggest fund size rather than age is the key factor degrading returns in older funds as the arcus team are associated with more than onequarter of their funds – the result of reinvesting performance fees – their overriding aim is to keep returns high and so grow their capital alongside that of external investors however with assets around  million there is still a reasonable amount of capacity to fill before arcus’s smallcap and hedge funds get close to their target of billion and attaining that is likely to take some quarters yet macrae wryly notes that institutional due diligence now comes by the kilo not the page however there is no rush two decades of deflation have taught the best japanese companies patience and made them lean and efficient the arcus team have learned the same lessons profile arcus japan fund  list of ceos founders and company directors directorpedianet  list of ceos founders board members and
