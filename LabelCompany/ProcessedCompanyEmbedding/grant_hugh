his own life grant later expressed “ although i owe whatever success ive had to four weddings and a funeral it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions one was that i was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth as im sure richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought thats all i could do i suppose because those films happened to be successful no one perhaps understandably  bothered to rent all the other films id done ” in july  grant signed a twoyear production deal with castle rock entertainment and by october he became founder and director of the ukbased simian films limited he appointed his thengirlfriend elizabeth hurley as the head of development to look for prospective projects simian films

was one of the choices to play james bond in s goldeneye but eventually lost out to pierce brosnan grants first studiofinanced hollywood project was chris columbuss comedy nine months though a hit at the box office it was almost universally panned by critics the washington post called it a grotesquely pandering caper and singled out grants performance as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriends unexpected pregnancy for his insufferable muggings the same year he played leading roles as emma thompsons suitor in ang lee’s academy awardwinning adaptation of jane austens sense and sensibility and as a cartographer in  wales in the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain in the same year he performed in the academy awardwinning restoration lisa schwarzbaum wrote grant is having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter and kevin thomas of los angeles times said he has some delicious moments in the film before the release of four weddings and a funeral grant reunited with its director mike newell for the tragicomedy an awfully big adventure that was labelled a determinedly offbeat film by the new york times grant portrayed a bitchy supercilious director of a repertory company in postworld war ii liverpool critic roger ebert wrote it shows that he has range as an actor but the san francisco chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film plays like a vanity production for grant janet maslin praising grant as superb and a dashing cad under any circumstances commented for him this film represents the road not taken made before four weddings and a funeral was released it captures mr grant as the clever versatile character actor he was then becoming rather than the international dreamboat he is today grant made his debut as a film producer with the  thriller extreme measures a commercial and critical failure though roger ebert and gene siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with siskel writing hugh grants work in extreme measures is a refreshing standout after a threeyear hiatus in  he paired with julia roberts in notting hill which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for four weddings and a funeral this new working title production displaced four weddings and a funeral as the biggest british hit in the history of cinema with earnings equalling  million worldwide as it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture the film was also received well by critics cnn reviewer paul clinton said notting hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds reactions to grants golden globenominated performance were varied with saloncoms stephanie zacharek criticising that grants performance stands as an emblem of whats wrong with notting hill whats maddening about grant is that he just never cuts the crap hes become one of those actors whos all shambling selfcaricature from his twinkly crows feet to the timelapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out the film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety most noted of which was grants turn as a fauxjournalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the new york times called a delightfully funny deadpan grant also released his second production output a fishoutofwater mob comedy mickey blue eyes that year it was dismissed by critics performed modestly at the box office and garnered its actorproducer mixed reviews for his starring role roger ebert thought hugh grant is wrong for the role and strikes one wrong note and then another whereas kenneth turan writing in the los angeles times said if hed been on the titanic fewer lives would have been lost if hed accompanied robert scott to the south pole the explorer would have lived to be  thats how good hugh grant is at rescuing doomed ventures while promoting woody allens small time crooks on nbcs the today show in  grant told host matt lauer its my millennium of bastards in  grant also joined the supervisory board of im internationalmedia ag the powerful munichbased film and media company small time crooks starred grant in the words of film critic andrew sarris as a petty petulant fauxpygmalion art dealer david who is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters mr allen has ever created in a role devoid of his comic attributes the new york times wrote mr grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation a year later his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher daniel cleaver in bridget joness diary  was proclaimed by variety to be as sly an overthrow of a stars polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory the film adapted from helen fieldings novel of the same name was an international hit earning  million worldwide grant was according to the washington post fitting as a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind the male gods countenance that he knows all too well grants immaculate comic performance bbc as the trustfunded womaniser will freeman in the film adaptation of nick hornbys bestselling novel about a boy received raves from critics almost universally praised with an academy awardnominated screenplay about a boy  was determined by the washington post to be that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishised coupledom and honesty over typical hollywood endings rolling stone wrote the acid comedy of grants performance carries the film and he gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs while roger ebert observed that the cary grant department is understaffed and hugh grant shows here that he is more than a star he is a resource released a day after the blockbuster star wars episode ii – attack of the clones about a boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful grant films making all of  million globally the film earned grant his third goldenglobe nomination while the london film critics circle named grant its best british actor and gq honoured him as one of the magazines men of the year  his performance can only be described as revelatory wrote critic ann hornaday adding that grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and selfawareness the new york observer concluded the film gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of hugh grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for wordsand with an english accent besides in the end the film comes over as a messy delight thanks to the skill generosity and goodsport punchingbag panache of mr grants performance about a boy also marked a notable change in grants boyish look now  he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair entertainment weeklys owen gleiberman took note of grants maturation in his review saying he looked noticeably older and that it looked good on him he added that grants pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn and the eyes that used to peer with love me cuteness now betray a sharks casual cunning everything about him is leaner and spikier including his hair which has been shorn and moussed into a eurochic bedhead mess but its not just his surface thats more virile the nervousness is gone too hugh grant has grown up holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherryclub mannerisms that were once his signature in doing so he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silvertongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency grant was also paired with sandra bullock in warner bross two weeks notice which made  million internationally but received poor reviews the village voice concluded that grants creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was little more than a britishism machine two weeks notice was followed by the  ensemble comedy love actually headlined by grant as the british prime minister a christmas release by working title films the film was promoted as the ultimate romantic comedy and accumulated  million at the international box office it marked the directorial debut of richard curtis who told the new york times that grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier curtis incarnations roger ebert claimed that grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian and has so much selfconfidence that he plays the british prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport film critic rex reed on the contrary called grants performance an oversexed bachelor spin on tony blair as the star flirted with himself in the paroxysm of selflove that has become his acting style in a  speech british prime minister tony blair referred to grants character in a speech saying i know theres a bit of us that would like me to do a hugh grant in love actually and tell america where to get off but the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life theres the next day the next year the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause grant in brussels october  in  grant reprised his role as daniel cleaver for a small part in bridget jones the edge of reason which like its predecessor made more than  million commercially gone from the screen for two years grant next reteamed with paul weitz about a boy for the black comedy american dreamz  grant starred as the acerbic host of an american idollike reality show where according to caryn james of the new york times nothing is real  except the black hole at the centre of the hosts heart as mr grant takes mr cowells villainous act to its limit american dreamz failed financially but grant was generously praised he played his selfaggrandising character an amalgam of simon cowell and ryan seacrest with smarmy selfloathing the boston globe proposed that this just may be the great comic role that has always eluded hugh grant and critic carina chocano said he is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy in  grant starred opposite drew barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called music and lyrics the associated press described it as a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy thats simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough though he neither listens to music nor owns any cds grant learned to sing play the piano dance a few mannered steps and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a hasbeen pop singer based loosely on andrew ridgeley the lesserknown member of s pop duo wham the starledger dismissed the performance writing that paper dolls have more depth the film with its revenues totalling  million allowed grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washedup lead character according to the san francisco chronicle grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to alexs career hes too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed but hes far too brazen to feel anything like shame in  grant starred opposite sarah jessica parker in the marc lawrences romantic comedy did you hear about the morgans which was a critical failure but was a box office success he reunited with lawrence again for a dramedy film the rewrite starring opposite marisa tomei the film received mixedtopositive reviews while grants performance was praised by many critics director quentin tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called grant a perfect leading man in  he had a supporting role as alexander waverly in guy ritchies the man from uncle entertainment weekly described his performance as the only bit of fun in the film glenn kenny of rogerebertcom gave film a mixed review but stated that while it can’t be said that hugh grant saves the movie his return to prominence in the last halfhour after a plotseedingwalkon earlier in the movie peps things up considerably in  he played st clair bayfield partner of the title character in the film florence foster jenkins directed by stephen frears and starring meryl streep grants performance was raved by film critics as careerbest screen international one of his best performances in years indiewire best work of his career variety where he goes deeper darker and riskier places rolling stone rafer guzman of newsday said surely the yearold actor has just sealed his firstever oscar nomination carrie rickey of yahoo movies commented grant deserves the globe an oscar nomination and the recognition — finally — that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors grant was nominated for his first individual screen actors guild award and also earned nominations for a bafta a golden globe a critics choice award a satellite award and a european film award several critics have put his work among the best acting performances of the year most award pundits have predicted him to get his first academy award nomination for his performance but grant was not nominated grant will next appear as a villain in a family film paddington  screen rolesedit grant has predominantly been a comedy especially a romantic comedy actor for almost all of his mainstream film career he also never ventures to play characters who are not british while some film critics such as roger ebert have defended the limited variety of his performances others have dismissed him as a onetrick pony eric fellner coowner of working title films and a longtime collaborator of grant said his range hasnt been fully tested but each performance is unique a majority of grants popular films in the s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love often with an american woman in earlier films grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed englishman for humorous effects allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously these performances were sometimes deemed overbearing in the words of washington posts rita kempley due to his comic overreactions—the mugging the stuttering the fluttering eyelids she added hes got more tics than benny hill grants penchant for conveying his characters feelings with mannerisms rather than direct emotions has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style stephen hunter of the washington post once stated that to be effective as a comic performer he must get his jiving and shucking under control film historian david thomson wrote in the new biographical dictionary of film about how it is merely itchy mannerisms that grant equates with screen acting on his choice of roles grant has said “ ive never been tempted to do the part where i cry or get aids or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews i genuinely believe that comedy acting light comedy acting is as hard as if not harder than serious acting and it genuinely doesn’t bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by kneejerk reaction go to the deepest darkest most serious performances and parts it makes me laugh ” grants screen persona of later films in the new millennium gradually developed into a cynical selfloathing cad claudia puig of usa today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally gone were the selfconscious arent i adorable mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of grants film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes according to carina chocano amongst film critics the two tropes most commonly associated with grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in bridget joness diary and about a boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself nonetheless grant has occasionally acted in dramas he played a sleazy snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film an awfully big adventure which received critical praise and for a very quiet dignified performance as frédéric chopin in james lapines biopic film impromptu in  grant played six incredibly evil characters in the epic drama film cloud atlas an experience he has spoken about positively grant said “ i do a lot of killing and raping in the film but it was a laugh i thought before i read it that id turn it down which i normally do but i was interested in meeting cloud atlas codirectors the wachowskis because i have always admired them enormously and they are so charming and fascinating i slightly called my own bluff in one of the parts i am a cannibal about  years in the future and i thought i can do that its easy and then i am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in germany and they are saying you know hungry we must have that flesheating like a leopard who is so hungry and i am thinking i cant do that just give me a witty line ” personalityedit grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in popular media for his guarded privacy on probing of his personal life he has remained steadfast in offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough grant has described himself as a reluctant actor has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be a phase in his life lasting no more than ten years a  vogue profile of grant referred to him as a man with a professionally misanthropic mystique grant has expressed distaste for focus groups market research and emphasis on opening weekend boxoffice numbers saying its so destructive to the filmmaking process what was wrong with the way they used to release films more slowly let them build the director mike newell has said there is at least as much of hugh that is charismatic intellectual and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him thats gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy filmmaker paul weitz said that grant is funny and that he perceives flaws in himself and other people and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless british newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy grant is a selfconfessed committed and passionate perfectionist on a film set the american film critic dave kehr has written that grant is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role – someone who works hard to make it look easy – though that isnt a trait he admires in himself grant is noted by coworkers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard grant dropped his agent in  ending a year relationship with caa grant has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career theyve known for years that i have total control ive never taken any advice on anything in the mediaedit libel lawsuitsedit in  grant won substantial damages from news uk ltd over what his lawyers called a highly defamatory article published in january  the companys nowdefunct newspaper today had falsely claimed that grant verbally abused a young extra with a foulmouthed tongue lashing on the set of the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain on  april  grant accepted undisclosed damages from the associated newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles which were published in the daily mail and the mail on sunday on   and  february his lawyer stated that all of the articles allegations and factual assertions are false grant said in a written statement that he took the action because i was tired of the daily mail and mail on sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain he went on to take the opportunity to stress im also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the socalled close friends or close sources on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist legal troublesedit on  june  grant was arrested in los angeles california in a police vice operation not far from sunset boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from hollywood prostitute divine brown he pleaded no contest and was fined  placed on two years summary probation and was ordered to complete an aids education program by robert j sandoval the arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of grants first major studio film nine months which he was scheduled to promote on several american television shows the tonight show with jay leno had him booked for the same week in the muchwatched interview grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after leno asked him what the hell were you thinking grant answered i think you know in life whats a good thing to do and whats a bad thing and i did a bad thing and there you have it on larry king live grant declined host larry kings repeated invitations to probe his psyche saying that psychoanalysis was more of an american syndrome and he himself was a bit old fashioned he told the host i dont have excuses grant was appreciated for his refreshing honesty as he faced the music and handled it with tongue in cheek in april  grant was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo ian whittaker grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident charges were dropped on  june by the crown prosecution service on the grounds of insufficient evidence phone hacking exposéedit main article news of the world phone hacking affair in april  grant published an article in the new statesman entitled the bugger bugged about a conversation following an earlier encounter with paul mcmullan a former journalist and paparazzo for news of the world in unguarded comments which were secretly taped by grant mcmullan alleged that editors at the daily mail and news of the world particularly andy coulson had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior british politicians mcmullan also said that every british prime minister from margaret thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with rupert murdoch and his senior executives he stressed the friendship between david cameron and rebekah brooks née wade agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping and asserting that camerons inaction could be explained by selfinterest cameron is very much in debt to rebekah wade for helping him not quite win the election  so that was my submission to parliament – that camerons either a liar or an idiot when asked by grant whether cameron had encouraged the metropolitan police to drag their feet on investigating illegal phone tapping by murdochs journalists mcmullan agreed this had happened and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists  per cent of the met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks so why would they want to open up that can of worms and whats wrong with that anyway it doesnt hurt anyone particularly grants article attracted considerable interest due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation and the novelty of grant himself turning the tables on a tabloid journalist whilst the allegations regarding the news of the world continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media grant appeared for example on bbc radio  it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered millie dowler had been hacked and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public and eventually political outrage grant became something of a spokesman against murdochs news corporation culminating in a performance on bbc televisions

spanish director and english actors the script would usually be written by a foreigner badly translated into english and then theyd get english actors in because they thought that was the way to sell it to america at  grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of four weddings and a funeral fwaaf if you read as many bad scripts as i did youd

golden globe award for best actor  motion picture musical or comedy and a bafta award for best actor in a leading role it also temporarily typecast him as the lead character charles a bohemian and debonair bachelor grant and curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star due to the parts he played was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter who is known for writing about himself and his own life grant later expressed “ although i owe whatever success ive had to four weddings and a funeral it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions one was that i was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth as im sure richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought thats all i could do i suppose because those films happened to be successful no one perhaps understandably  bothered to rent all the other films id done ” in july  grant signed a twoyear production deal with castle rock entertainment and by october he became founder and director of the ukbased simian films limited he appointed his thengirlfriend elizabeth hurley as the head of development to look for prospective projects simian films

was one of the choices to play james bond in s goldeneye but eventually lost out to pierce brosnan grants first studiofinanced hollywood project was chris columbuss comedy nine months though a hit at the box office it was almost universally panned by critics the washington post called it a grotesquely pandering caper and singled out grants performance as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriends unexpected pregnancy for his insufferable muggings the same year he played leading roles as emma thompsons suitor in ang lee’s academy awardwinning adaptation of jane austens sense and sensibility and as a cartographer in  wales in the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain in the same year he performed in the academy awardwinning restoration lisa schwarzbaum wrote grant is having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter and kevin thomas of los angeles times said he has some delicious moments in the film before the release of four weddings and a funeral grant reunited with its director mike newell for the tragicomedy an awfully big adventure that was labelled a determinedly offbeat film by the new york times grant portrayed a bitchy supercilious director of a repertory company in postworld war ii liverpool critic roger ebert wrote it shows that he has range as an actor but the san francisco chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film plays like a vanity production for grant janet maslin praising grant as superb and a dashing cad under any circumstances commented for him this film represents the road not taken made before four weddings and a funeral was released it captures mr grant as the clever versatile character actor he was then becoming rather than the international dreamboat he is today grant made his debut as a film producer with the  thriller extreme measures a commercial and critical failure though roger ebert and gene siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with siskel writing hugh grants work in extreme measures is a refreshing standout after a threeyear hiatus in  he paired with julia roberts in notting hill which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for four weddings and a funeral this new working title production displaced four weddings and a funeral as the biggest british hit in the history of cinema with earnings equalling  million worldwide as it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture the film was also received well by critics cnn reviewer paul clinton said notting hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds reactions to grants golden globenominated performance were varied with saloncoms stephanie zacharek criticising that grants performance stands as an emblem of whats wrong with notting hill whats maddening about grant is that he just never cuts the crap hes become one of those actors whos all shambling selfcaricature from his twinkly crows feet to the timelapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out the film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety most noted of which was grants turn as a fauxjournalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the new york times called a delightfully funny deadpan grant also released his second production output a fishoutofwater mob comedy mickey blue eyes that year it was dismissed by critics performed modestly at the box office and garnered its actorproducer mixed reviews for his starring role roger ebert thought hugh grant is wrong for the role and strikes one wrong note and then another whereas kenneth turan writing in the los angeles times said if hed been on the titanic fewer lives would have been lost if hed accompanied robert scott to the south pole the explorer would have lived to be  thats how good hugh grant is at rescuing doomed ventures while promoting woody allens small time crooks on nbcs the today show in  grant told host matt lauer its my millennium of bastards in  grant also joined the supervisory board of im internationalmedia ag the powerful munichbased film and media company small time crooks starred grant in the words of film critic andrew sarris as a petty petulant fauxpygmalion art dealer david who is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters mr allen has ever created in a role devoid of his comic attributes the new york times wrote mr grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation a year later his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher daniel cleaver in bridget joness diary  was proclaimed by variety to be as sly an overthrow of a stars polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory the film adapted from helen fieldings novel of the same name was an international hit earning  million worldwide grant was according to the washington post fitting as a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind the male gods countenance that he knows all too well grants immaculate comic performance bbc as the trustfunded womaniser will freeman in the film adaptation of nick hornbys bestselling novel about a boy received raves from critics almost universally praised with an academy awardnominated screenplay about a boy  was determined by the washington post to be that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishised coupledom and honesty over typical hollywood endings rolling stone wrote the acid comedy of grants performance carries the film and he gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs while roger ebert observed that the cary grant department is understaffed and hugh grant shows here that he is more than a star he is a resource released a day after the blockbuster star wars episode ii – attack of the clones about a boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful grant films making all of  million globally the film earned grant his third goldenglobe nomination while the london film critics circle named grant its best british actor and gq honoured him as one of the magazines men of the year  his performance can only be described as revelatory wrote critic ann hornaday adding that grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and selfawareness the new york observer concluded the film gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of hugh grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for wordsand with an english accent besides in the end the film comes over as a messy delight thanks to the skill generosity and goodsport punchingbag panache of mr grants performance about a boy also marked a notable change in grants boyish look now  he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair entertainment weeklys owen gleiberman took note of grants maturation in his review saying he looked noticeably older and that it looked good on him he added that grants pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn and the eyes that used to peer with love me cuteness now betray a sharks casual cunning everything about him is leaner and spikier including his hair which has been shorn and moussed into a eurochic bedhead mess but its not just his surface thats more virile the nervousness is gone too hugh grant has grown up holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherryclub mannerisms that were once his signature in doing so he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silvertongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency grant was also paired with sandra bullock in warner bross two weeks notice which made  million internationally but received poor reviews the village voice concluded that grants creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was little more than a britishism machine two weeks notice was followed by the  ensemble comedy love actually headlined by grant as the british prime minister a christmas release by working title films the film was promoted as the ultimate romantic comedy and accumulated  million at the international box office it marked the directorial debut of richard curtis who told the new york times that grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier curtis incarnations roger ebert claimed that grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian and has so much selfconfidence that he plays the british prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport film critic rex reed on the contrary called grants performance an oversexed bachelor spin on tony blair as the star flirted with himself in the paroxysm of selflove that has become his acting style in a  speech british prime minister tony blair referred to grants character in a speech saying i know theres a bit of us that would like me to do a hugh grant in love actually and tell america where to get off but the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life theres the next day the next year the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause grant in brussels october  in  grant reprised his role as daniel cleaver for a small part in bridget jones the edge of reason which like its predecessor made more than  million commercially gone from the screen for two years grant next reteamed with paul weitz about a boy for the black comedy american dreamz  grant starred as the acerbic host of an american idollike reality show where according to caryn james of the new york times nothing is real  except the black hole at the centre of the hosts heart as mr grant takes mr cowells villainous act to its limit american dreamz failed financially but grant was generously praised he played his selfaggrandising character an amalgam of simon cowell and ryan seacrest with smarmy selfloathing the boston globe proposed that this just may be the great comic role that has always eluded hugh grant and critic carina chocano said he is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy in  grant starred opposite drew barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called music and lyrics the associated press described it as a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy thats simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough though he neither listens to music nor owns any cds grant learned to sing play the piano dance a few mannered steps and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a hasbeen pop singer based loosely on andrew ridgeley the lesserknown member of s pop duo wham the starledger dismissed the performance writing that paper dolls have more depth the film with its revenues totalling  million allowed grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washedup lead character according to the san francisco chronicle grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to alexs career hes too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed but hes far too brazen to feel anything like shame in  grant starred opposite sarah jessica parker in the marc lawrences romantic comedy did you hear about the morgans which was a critical failure but was a box office success he reunited with lawrence again for a dramedy film the rewrite starring opposite marisa tomei the film received mixedtopositive reviews while grants performance was praised by many critics director quentin tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called grant a perfect leading man in  he had a supporting role as alexander waverly in guy ritchies the man from uncle entertainment weekly described his performance as the only bit of fun in the film glenn kenny of rogerebertcom gave film a mixed review but stated that while it can’t be said that hugh grant saves the movie his return to prominence in the last halfhour after a plotseedingwalkon earlier in the movie peps things up considerably in  he played st clair bayfield partner of the title character in the film florence foster jenkins directed by stephen frears and starring meryl streep grants performance was raved by film critics as careerbest screen international one of his best performances in years indiewire best work of his career variety where he goes deeper darker and riskier places rolling stone rafer guzman of newsday said surely the yearold actor has just sealed his firstever oscar nomination carrie rickey of yahoo movies commented grant deserves the globe an oscar nomination and the recognition — finally — that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors grant was nominated for his first individual screen actors guild award and also earned nominations for a bafta a golden globe a critics choice award a satellite award and a european film award several critics have put his work among the best acting performances of the year most award pundits have predicted him to get his first academy award nomination for his performance but grant was not nominated grant will next appear as a villain in a family film paddington  screen rolesedit grant has predominantly been a comedy especially a romantic comedy actor for almost all of his mainstream film career he also never ventures to play characters who are not british while some film critics such as roger ebert have defended the limited variety of his performances others have dismissed him as a onetrick pony eric fellner coowner of working title films and a longtime collaborator of grant said his range hasnt been fully tested but each performance is unique a majority of grants popular films in the s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love often with an american woman in earlier films grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed englishman for humorous effects allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously these performances were sometimes deemed overbearing in the words of washington posts rita kempley due to his comic overreactions—the mugging the stuttering the fluttering eyelids she added hes got more tics than benny hill grants penchant for conveying his characters feelings with mannerisms rather than direct emotions has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style stephen hunter of the washington post once stated that to be effective as a comic performer he must get his jiving and shucking under control film historian david thomson wrote in the new biographical dictionary of film about how it is merely itchy mannerisms that grant equates with screen acting on his choice of roles grant has said “ ive never been tempted to do the part where i cry or get aids or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews i genuinely believe that comedy acting light comedy acting is as hard as if not harder than serious acting and it genuinely doesn’t bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by kneejerk reaction go to the deepest darkest most serious performances and parts it makes me laugh ” grants screen persona of later films in the new millennium gradually developed into a cynical selfloathing cad claudia puig of usa today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally gone were the selfconscious arent i adorable mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of grants film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes according to carina chocano amongst film critics the two tropes most commonly associated with grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in bridget joness diary and about a boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself nonetheless grant has occasionally acted in dramas he played a sleazy snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film an awfully big adventure which received critical praise and for a very quiet dignified performance as frédéric chopin in james lapines biopic film impromptu in  grant played six incredibly evil characters in the epic drama film cloud atlas an experience he has spoken about positively grant said “ i do a lot of killing and raping in the film but it was a laugh i thought before i read it that id turn it down which i normally do but i was interested in meeting cloud atlas codirectors the wachowskis because i have always admired them enormously and they are so charming and fascinating i slightly called my own bluff in one of the parts i am a cannibal about  years in the future and i thought i can do that its easy and then i am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in germany and they are saying you know hungry we must have that flesheating like a leopard who is so hungry and i am thinking i cant do that just give me a witty line ” personalityedit grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in popular media for his guarded privacy on probing of his personal life he has remained steadfast in offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough grant has described himself as a reluctant actor has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be a phase in his life lasting no more than ten years a  vogue profile of grant referred to him as a man with a professionally misanthropic mystique grant has expressed distaste for focus groups market research and emphasis on opening weekend boxoffice numbers saying its so destructive to the filmmaking process what was wrong with the way they used to release films more slowly let them build the director mike newell has said there is at least as much of hugh that is charismatic intellectual and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him thats gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy filmmaker paul weitz said that grant is funny and that he perceives flaws in himself and other people and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless british newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy grant is a selfconfessed committed and passionate perfectionist on a film set the american film critic dave kehr has written that grant is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role – someone who works hard to make it look easy – though that isnt a trait he admires in himself grant is noted by coworkers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard grant dropped his agent in  ending a year relationship with caa grant has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career theyve known for years that i have total control ive never taken any advice on anything in the mediaedit libel lawsuitsedit in  grant won substantial damages from news uk ltd over what his lawyers called a highly defamatory article published in january  the companys nowdefunct newspaper today had falsely claimed that grant verbally abused a young extra with a foulmouthed tongue lashing on the set of the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain on  april  grant accepted undisclosed damages from the associated newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles which were published in the daily mail and the mail on sunday on   and  february his lawyer stated that all of the articles allegations and factual assertions are false grant said in a written statement that he took the action because i was tired of the daily mail and mail on sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain he went on to take the opportunity to stress im also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the socalled close friends or close sources on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist legal troublesedit on  june  grant was arrested in los angeles california in a police vice operation not far from sunset boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from hollywood prostitute divine brown he pleaded no contest and was fined  placed on two years summary probation and was ordered to complete an aids education program by robert j sandoval the arrest occurred about two weeks before

whats a bad thing and i did a bad thing and there you have it on larry king live grant declined host larry kings repeated invitations to probe his psyche saying that psychoanalysis was more of an american syndrome and he himself was a bit old fashioned he told the host i dont have excuses grant was appreciated for his refreshing honesty as he faced the music and handled it with tongue in cheek in april  grant was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo ian whittaker grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident charges were dropped on  june by the crown prosecution service on the grounds of insufficient evidence phone hacking exposéedit main article news of the world phone hacking affair in april  grant published an article in the new statesman entitled the bugger bugged about a conversation following an earlier encounter with paul mcmullan a former journalist and paparazzo for news of the world in unguarded comments which were secretly taped by grant mcmullan alleged that editors at the daily mail and news of the world particularly andy coulson had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior british politicians mcmullan also said that every british prime minister from margaret thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with rupert murdoch and his senior executives he stressed the friendship between david cameron and rebekah brooks née wade agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping and asserting that camerons inaction could be explained by selfinterest cameron is very much in debt to rebekah wade for helping him not quite win the election  so that was my submission to parliament – that camerons either a liar or an idiot when asked by grant whether cameron had encouraged the metropolitan police to drag their feet on investigating illegal phone tapping by murdochs journalists mcmullan agreed this had happened and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists  per cent of the met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks so why would they want to open up that can of worms and whats wrong with that anyway it doesnt hurt anyone particularly grants article attracted considerable interest due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation and the novelty of grant himself turning the tables on a tabloid journalist whilst the allegations regarding the news of the world continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media grant appeared for example on bbc radio  it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered millie dowler had been hacked and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public and eventually political outrage grant became something of a spokesman against murdochs news corporation culminating in a performance on bbc televisions

sexual obsession and cruelty by the washington post his other work in period pieces such as ken russells horror film the lair of the white worm  awardwinning merchantivory drama the remains of the day  and as frédéric chopin in impromptu  went largely unnoticed he later called this phase of his career hilarious referring to his early films as europuddings where you would have a french script a spanish director and english actors the script would usually be written by a foreigner badly translated into english and then theyd get english actors in because they thought that was the way to sell it to america at  grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of four weddings and a funeral fwaaf if you read as many bad scripts as i did youd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny he later recalled released in  fwaaf became the highestgrossing british film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of  million making grant an overnight international star the film was nominated for two academy awards and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew it earned grant his first and only golden globe award for best actor  motion picture musical or comedy and a bafta award for best actor in a leading role it also temporarily typecast him as the lead character charles a bohemian and debonair bachelor grant and curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star due to the parts he played was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter who is known for writing about himself and his own life grant later expressed “ although i owe whatever success ive had to four weddings and a funeral it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions one was that i was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth as im sure richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought thats all i could do i suppose because those films happened to be successful no one perhaps understandably  bothered to rent all the other films id done ” in july  grant signed a twoyear production deal with castle rock entertainment and by october he became founder and director of the ukbased simian films limited he appointed his thengirlfriend elizabeth hurley as the head of development to look for prospective projects simian films produced two grant vehicles in the s and lost a bid to produce about a boy to robert de niros tribeca productions the company closed its us office in  and grant resigned as director in december  grant was one of the choices to play james bond in s goldeneye but eventually lost out to pierce brosnan grants first studiofinanced hollywood project was chris columbuss comedy nine months though a hit at the box office it was almost universally panned by critics the washington post called it a grotesquely pandering caper and singled out grants performance as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriends unexpected pregnancy for his insufferable muggings the same year he played leading roles as emma thompsons suitor in ang lee’s academy awardwinning adaptation of jane austens sense and sensibility and as a cartographer in  wales in the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain in the same year he performed in the academy awardwinning restoration lisa schwarzbaum wrote grant is having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter and kevin thomas of los angeles times said he has some delicious moments in the film before the release of four weddings and a funeral grant reunited with its director mike newell for the tragicomedy an awfully big adventure that was labelled a determinedly offbeat film by the new york times grant portrayed a bitchy supercilious director of a repertory company in postworld war ii liverpool critic roger ebert wrote it shows that he has range as an actor but the san francisco chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film plays like a vanity production for grant janet maslin praising grant as superb and a dashing cad under any circumstances commented for him this film represents the road not taken made before four weddings and a funeral was released it captures mr grant as the clever versatile character actor he was then becoming rather than the international dreamboat he is today grant made his debut as a film producer with the  thriller extreme measures a commercial and critical failure though roger ebert and gene siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with siskel writing hugh grants work in extreme measures is a refreshing standout after a threeyear hiatus in  he paired with julia roberts in notting hill which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for four weddings and a funeral this new working title production displaced four weddings and a funeral as the biggest british hit in the history of cinema with earnings equalling  million worldwide as it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture the film was also received well by critics cnn reviewer paul clinton said notting hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds reactions to grants golden globenominated performance were varied with saloncoms stephanie zacharek criticising that grants performance stands as an emblem of whats wrong with notting hill whats maddening about grant is that he just never cuts the crap hes become one of those actors whos all shambling selfcaricature from his twinkly crows feet to the timelapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out the film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety most noted of which was grants turn as a fauxjournalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the new york times called a delightfully funny deadpan grant also released his second production output a fishoutofwater mob comedy mickey blue eyes that year it was dismissed by critics performed modestly at the box office and garnered its actorproducer mixed reviews for his starring role roger ebert thought hugh grant is wrong for the role and strikes one wrong note and then another whereas kenneth turan writing in the los angeles times said if hed been on the titanic fewer lives would have been lost if hed accompanied robert scott to the south pole the explorer would have lived to be  thats how good hugh grant is at rescuing doomed ventures while promoting woody allens small time crooks on nbcs the today show in  grant told host matt lauer its my millennium of bastards in  grant also joined the supervisory board of im internationalmedia ag the powerful munichbased film and media company small time crooks starred grant in the words of film critic andrew sarris as a petty petulant fauxpygmalion art dealer david who is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters mr allen has ever created in a role devoid of his comic attributes the new york times wrote mr grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation a year later his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher daniel cleaver in bridget joness diary  was proclaimed by variety to be as sly an overthrow of a stars polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory the film adapted from helen fieldings novel of the same name was an international hit earning  million worldwide grant was according to the washington post fitting as a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind the male gods countenance that he knows all too well grants immaculate comic performance bbc as the trustfunded womaniser will freeman in the film adaptation of nick hornbys bestselling novel about a boy received raves from critics almost universally praised with an academy awardnominated screenplay about a boy  was determined by the washington post to be that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishised coupledom and honesty over typical hollywood endings rolling stone wrote the acid comedy of grants performance carries the film and he gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs while roger ebert observed that the cary grant department is understaffed and hugh grant shows here that he is more than a star he is a resource released a day after the blockbuster star wars episode ii – attack of the clones about a boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful grant films making all of  million globally the film earned grant his third goldenglobe nomination while the london film critics circle named grant its best british actor and gq honoured him as one of the magazines men of the year  his performance can only be described as revelatory wrote critic ann hornaday adding that grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and selfawareness the new york observer concluded the film gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of hugh grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for wordsand with an english accent besides in the end the film comes over as a messy delight thanks to the skill generosity and goodsport punchingbag panache of mr grants performance about a boy also marked a notable change in grants boyish look now  he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair entertainment weeklys owen gleiberman took note of grants maturation in his review saying he looked noticeably older and that it looked good on him he added that grants pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn and the eyes that used to peer with love me cuteness now betray a sharks casual cunning everything about him is leaner and spikier including his hair which has been shorn and moussed into a eurochic bedhead mess but its not just his surface thats more virile the nervousness is gone too hugh grant has grown up holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherryclub mannerisms that were once his signature in doing so he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silvertongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency grant was also paired with sandra bullock in warner bross two weeks notice which made  million internationally but received poor reviews the village voice concluded that grants creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was little more than a britishism machine two weeks notice was followed by the  ensemble comedy love actually headlined by grant as the british prime minister a christmas release by working title films the film was promoted as the ultimate romantic comedy and accumulated  million at the international box office it marked the directorial debut of richard curtis who told the new york times that grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier curtis incarnations roger ebert claimed that grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian and has so much selfconfidence that he plays the british prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport film critic rex reed on the contrary called grants performance an oversexed bachelor spin on tony blair as the star flirted with himself in the paroxysm of selflove that has become his acting style in a  speech british prime minister tony blair referred to grants character in a speech saying i know theres a bit of us that would like me to do a hugh grant in love actually and tell america where to get off but the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life theres the next day the next year the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause grant in brussels october  in  grant reprised his role as daniel cleaver for a small part in bridget jones the edge of reason which like its predecessor made more than  million commercially gone from the screen for two years grant next reteamed with paul weitz about a boy for the black comedy american dreamz  grant starred as the acerbic host of an american idollike reality show where according to caryn james of the new york times nothing is real  except the black hole at the centre of the hosts heart as mr grant takes mr cowells villainous act to its limit american dreamz failed financially but grant was generously praised he played his selfaggrandising character an amalgam of simon cowell and ryan seacrest with smarmy selfloathing the boston globe proposed that this just may be the great comic role that has always eluded hugh grant and critic carina chocano said he is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy in  grant starred opposite drew barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called music and lyrics the associated press described it as a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy thats simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough though he neither listens to music nor owns any cds grant learned to sing play the piano dance a few mannered steps and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a hasbeen pop singer based loosely on andrew ridgeley the lesserknown member of s pop duo wham the starledger dismissed the performance writing that paper dolls have more depth the film with its revenues totalling  million allowed grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washedup lead character according to the san francisco chronicle grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to alexs career hes too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed but hes far too brazen to feel anything like shame in  grant starred opposite sarah jessica parker in the marc lawrences romantic comedy did you hear about the morgans which was a critical failure but was a box office success he reunited with lawrence again for a dramedy film the rewrite starring opposite marisa tomei the film received mixedtopositive reviews while grants performance was praised by many critics director quentin tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called grant a perfect leading man in  he had a supporting role as alexander waverly in guy ritchies the man from uncle entertainment weekly described his performance as the only bit of fun in the film glenn kenny of rogerebertcom gave film a mixed review but stated that while it can’t be said that hugh grant saves the movie his return to prominence in the last halfhour after a plotseedingwalkon earlier in the movie peps things up considerably in  he played st clair bayfield partner of the title character in the film florence foster jenkins directed by stephen frears and starring meryl streep grants performance was raved by film critics as careerbest screen international one of his best performances in years indiewire best work of his career variety where he goes deeper darker and riskier places rolling stone rafer guzman of newsday said surely the yearold actor has just sealed his firstever oscar nomination carrie rickey of yahoo movies commented grant deserves the globe an oscar nomination and the recognition — finally — that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors grant was nominated for his first individual screen actors guild award and also earned nominations for a bafta a golden globe a critics choice award a satellite award and a european film award several critics have put his work among the best acting performances of the year most award pundits have predicted him to get his first academy award nomination for his performance but grant was not nominated grant will next appear as a villain in a family film paddington  screen rolesedit grant has predominantly been a comedy especially a romantic comedy actor for almost all of his mainstream film career he also never ventures to play characters who are not british while some film critics such as roger ebert have defended the limited variety of his performances others have dismissed him as a onetrick pony eric fellner coowner of working title films and a longtime collaborator of grant said his range hasnt been fully tested but each performance is unique a majority of grants popular films in the s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love often with an american woman in earlier films grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed englishman for humorous effects allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously these performances were sometimes deemed overbearing in the words of washington posts rita kempley due to his comic overreactions—the mugging the stuttering the fluttering eyelids she added hes got more tics than benny hill grants penchant for conveying his characters feelings with mannerisms rather than direct emotions has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style stephen hunter of the washington post once stated that to be effective as a comic performer he must get his jiving and shucking under control film historian david thomson wrote in the new biographical dictionary of film about how it is merely itchy mannerisms that grant equates with screen acting on his choice of roles grant has said “ ive never been tempted to do the part where i cry or get aids or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews i genuinely believe that comedy acting light comedy acting is as hard as if not harder than serious acting and it genuinely doesn’t bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by kneejerk reaction go to the deepest darkest most serious performances and parts it makes me laugh ” grants screen persona of later films in the new millennium gradually developed into a cynical selfloathing cad claudia puig of usa today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally gone were the selfconscious arent i adorable mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of grants film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes according to carina chocano amongst film critics the two tropes most commonly associated with grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in bridget joness diary and about a boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself nonetheless grant has occasionally acted in dramas he played a sleazy snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film an awfully big adventure which received critical praise and for a very quiet dignified performance as frédéric chopin in james lapines biopic film impromptu in  grant played six incredibly evil characters in the epic drama film cloud atlas an experience he has spoken about positively grant said “ i do a lot of killing and raping in the film but it was a laugh i thought before i read it that id turn it down which i normally do but i was interested in meeting cloud atlas codirectors the wachowskis because i have always admired them enormously and they are so charming and fascinating i slightly called my own bluff in one of the parts i am a cannibal about  years in the future and i thought i can do that its easy and then i am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in germany and they are saying you know hungry we must have that flesheating like a leopard who is so hungry and i am thinking i cant do that just give me a witty line ” personalityedit grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in popular media for his guarded privacy on probing of his personal life he has remained steadfast in offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough grant has described himself as a reluctant actor has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be a phase in his life lasting no more than ten years a  vogue profile of grant referred to him as a man with a professionally misanthropic mystique grant has expressed distaste for focus groups market research and emphasis on opening weekend boxoffice numbers saying its so destructive to the filmmaking process what was wrong with the way they used to release films more slowly let them build the director mike newell has said there is at least as much of hugh that is charismatic intellectual and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him thats gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy filmmaker paul weitz said that grant is funny and that he perceives flaws in himself and other people and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless british newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy grant is a selfconfessed committed and passionate perfectionist on a film set the american film critic dave kehr has written that grant is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role – someone who works hard to make it look easy – though that isnt a trait he admires in himself grant is noted by coworkers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard grant dropped his agent in  ending a year relationship with caa grant has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career theyve known for years that i have total control ive never taken any advice on anything in the mediaedit libel lawsuitsedit in  grant won substantial damages from news uk ltd over what his lawyers called a highly defamatory article published in january  the companys nowdefunct newspaper today had falsely claimed that grant verbally abused a young extra with a foulmouthed tongue lashing on the set of the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain on  april  grant accepted undisclosed damages from the associated newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles which were published in the daily mail and the mail on sunday on   and  february his lawyer stated that all of the articles allegations and factual assertions are false grant said in a written statement that he took the action because i was tired of the daily mail and mail on sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain he went on to take the opportunity to stress im also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the socalled close friends or close sources on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist legal troublesedit on  june  grant was arrested in los angeles california in a police vice operation not far from sunset boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from hollywood prostitute divine brown he pleaded no contest and was fined  placed on two years summary probation and was ordered to complete an aids education program by robert j sandoval the arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of grants first major studio film nine months which he was scheduled to promote on several american television shows the tonight show with jay leno had him booked for the same week in the muchwatched interview grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after leno asked him what the hell were you thinking grant answered i think you know in life whats a good thing to do and whats a bad thing and i did a bad thing and there you have it on larry king live grant declined host larry kings repeated invitations to probe his psyche saying that psychoanalysis was more of an american syndrome and he himself was a bit old fashioned he told the host i dont have excuses grant was appreciated for his refreshing honesty as he faced the music and handled it with tongue in cheek in april  grant was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo ian whittaker grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident charges were dropped on  june by the crown prosecution service on the grounds of insufficient evidence phone hacking exposéedit main article news of the world phone hacking affair in april  grant published an article in the new statesman entitled the bugger bugged about a conversation following an earlier encounter with paul mcmullan a former journalist and paparazzo for news of the world in unguarded comments which were secretly taped by grant mcmullan alleged that editors at the daily mail and news of the world particularly andy coulson had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior british politicians mcmullan also said that every british prime minister from margaret thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with rupert murdoch and his senior executives he stressed the friendship between david cameron and rebekah brooks née wade agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping and asserting that camerons inaction could be explained by selfinterest cameron is very much in debt to rebekah wade for helping him not quite win the election  so that was my submission to parliament – that camerons either a liar or an idiot when asked by grant whether cameron had encouraged the metropolitan police to drag their feet on investigating illegal phone tapping by murdochs journalists mcmullan agreed this had happened and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists  per cent of the met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks so why would they want to open up that can of worms and whats wrong with that anyway it doesnt hurt anyone particularly grants article attracted considerable interest due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation and the novelty of grant himself turning the tables on a tabloid journalist whilst the allegations regarding the news of the world continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media grant appeared for example on bbc radio  it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered millie dowler had been hacked and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public and eventually political outrage grant became something of a spokesman against murdochs news corporation culminating in a performance on bbc televisions

is what ive been doing for the last  years personal lifeedit relationshipsedit grant during the second round of alfred dunhill links championship october  in  while playing lord byron in the spanish

debauchery and decadence grant received an offer from the courtauld institute of art university of london to pursue a phd in the history of art but decided not to take the offer because he failed to secure a grant viewing acting as nothing more than a creative outlet he joined the oxford university dramatic society and starred in a successful touring production of twelfth night young earneredit after making his debut as hughie grant in the oxfordfinanced privileged  grant dabbled in a variety of jobs such as working as an assistant groundsman at fulham football club tutoring writing comedy

sexual obsession and cruelty by the washington post his other work in period pieces such as ken russells horror film the lair of the white worm  awardwinning merchantivory drama the remains of the day  and as frédéric chopin in impromptu  went largely unnoticed he later called this phase of his career hilarious referring to his early films as europuddings where you would have a french script a spanish director and english actors the script would usually be written by a foreigner badly translated into english and then theyd get english actors in because they thought that was the way to sell it to america at  grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of four weddings and a funeral fwaaf if you read as many bad scripts as i did youd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny he later recalled released in  fwaaf became the highestgrossing british film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of  million making grant an overnight international star the film was nominated for two academy awards and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew it earned grant his first and only golden globe award for best actor  motion picture musical or comedy and a bafta award for best actor in a leading role it also temporarily typecast him as the lead character charles a bohemian and debonair bachelor grant and curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star due to the parts he played was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter who is known for writing about himself and his own life grant later expressed “ although i owe whatever success ive had to four weddings and a funeral it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions one was that i was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth as im sure richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought thats all i could do i suppose because those films happened to be successful no one perhaps understandably  bothered to rent all the other films id done ” in july  grant signed a twoyear production deal with castle rock entertainment and by october he became founder and director of the ukbased simian films limited he appointed his thengirlfriend elizabeth hurley as the head of development to look for prospective projects simian films produced two grant vehicles in the s and lost a bid to produce about a boy to robert de niros tribeca productions the company closed its us office in  and grant resigned as director in december  grant was one of the choices to play james bond in s goldeneye but eventually lost out to pierce brosnan grants first studiofinanced hollywood project was chris columbuss comedy nine months though a hit at the box office it was almost universally panned by critics the washington post called it a grotesquely pandering caper and singled out grants performance as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriends unexpected pregnancy for his insufferable muggings the same year he played leading roles as emma thompsons suitor in ang lee’s academy awardwinning adaptation of jane austens sense and sensibility and as a cartographer in  wales in the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain in the same year he performed in the academy awardwinning restoration lisa schwarzbaum wrote grant is having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter and kevin thomas of los angeles times said he has some delicious moments in the film before the release of four weddings and a funeral grant reunited with its director mike newell for the tragicomedy an awfully big adventure that was labelled a determinedly offbeat film by the new york times grant portrayed a bitchy supercilious director of a repertory company in postworld war ii liverpool critic roger ebert wrote it shows that he has range as an actor but the san francisco chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film plays like a vanity production for grant janet maslin praising grant as superb and a dashing cad under any circumstances commented for him this film represents the road not taken made before four weddings and a funeral was released it captures mr grant as the clever versatile character actor he was then becoming rather than the international dreamboat he is today grant made his debut as a film producer with the  thriller extreme measures a commercial and critical failure though roger ebert and gene siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with siskel writing hugh grants work in extreme measures is a refreshing standout after a threeyear hiatus in  he paired with julia roberts in notting hill which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for four weddings and a funeral this new working title production displaced four weddings and a funeral as the biggest british hit in the history of cinema with earnings equalling  million worldwide as it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture the film was also received well by critics cnn reviewer paul clinton said notting hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds reactions to grants golden globenominated performance were varied with saloncoms stephanie zacharek criticising that grants performance stands as an emblem of whats wrong with notting hill whats maddening about grant is that he just never cuts the crap hes become one of those actors whos all shambling selfcaricature from his twinkly crows feet to the timelapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out the film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety most noted of which was grants turn as a fauxjournalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the new york times called a delightfully funny deadpan grant also released his second production output a fishoutofwater mob comedy mickey blue eyes that year it was dismissed by critics performed modestly at the box office and garnered its actorproducer mixed reviews for his starring role roger ebert thought hugh grant is wrong for the role and strikes one wrong note and then another whereas kenneth turan writing in the los angeles times said if hed been on the titanic fewer lives would have been lost if hed accompanied robert scott to the south pole the explorer would have lived to be  thats how good hugh grant is at rescuing doomed ventures while promoting woody allens small time crooks on nbcs the today show in  grant told host matt lauer its my millennium of bastards in  grant also joined the supervisory board of im internationalmedia ag the powerful munichbased film and media company small time crooks starred grant in the words of film critic andrew sarris as a petty petulant fauxpygmalion art dealer david who is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters mr allen has ever created in a role devoid of his comic attributes the new york times wrote mr grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation a year later his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher daniel cleaver in bridget joness diary  was proclaimed by variety to be as sly an overthrow of a stars polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory the film adapted from helen fieldings novel of the same name was an international hit earning  million worldwide grant was according to the washington post fitting as a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind the male gods countenance that he knows all too well grants immaculate comic performance bbc as the trustfunded womaniser will freeman in the film adaptation of nick hornbys bestselling novel about a boy received raves from critics almost universally praised with an academy awardnominated screenplay about a boy  was determined by the washington post to be that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishised coupledom and honesty over typical hollywood endings rolling stone wrote the acid comedy of grants performance carries the film and he gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs while roger ebert observed that the cary grant department is understaffed and hugh grant shows here that he is more than a star he is a resource released a day after the blockbuster star wars episode ii – attack of the clones about a boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful grant films making all of  million globally the film earned grant his third goldenglobe nomination while the london film critics circle named grant its best british actor and gq honoured him as one of the magazines men of the year  his performance can only be described as revelatory wrote critic ann hornaday adding that grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and selfawareness the new york observer concluded the film gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of hugh grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for wordsand with an english accent besides in the end the film comes over as a messy delight thanks to the skill generosity and goodsport punchingbag panache of mr grants performance about a boy also marked a notable change in grants boyish look now  he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair entertainment weeklys owen gleiberman took note of grants maturation in his review saying he looked noticeably older and that it looked good on him he added that grants pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn and the eyes that used to peer with love me cuteness now betray a sharks casual cunning everything about him is leaner and spikier including his hair which has been shorn and moussed into a eurochic bedhead mess but its not just his surface thats more virile the nervousness is gone too hugh grant has grown up holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherryclub mannerisms that were once his signature in doing so he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silvertongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency grant was also paired with sandra bullock in warner bross two weeks notice which made  million internationally but received poor reviews the village voice concluded that grants creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was little more than a britishism machine two weeks notice was followed by the  ensemble comedy love actually headlined by grant as the british prime minister a christmas release by working title films the film was promoted as the ultimate romantic comedy and accumulated  million at the international box office it marked the directorial debut of richard curtis who told the new york times that grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier curtis incarnations roger ebert claimed that grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian and has so much selfconfidence that he plays the british prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport film critic rex reed on the contrary called grants performance an oversexed bachelor spin on tony blair as the star flirted with himself in the paroxysm of selflove that has become his acting style in a  speech british prime minister tony blair referred to grants character in a speech saying i know theres a bit of us that would like me to do a hugh grant in love actually and tell america where to get off but the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life theres the next day the next year the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause grant in brussels october  in  grant reprised his role as daniel cleaver for a small part in bridget jones the edge of reason which like its predecessor made more than  million commercially gone from the screen for two years grant next reteamed with paul weitz about a boy for the black comedy american dreamz  grant starred as the acerbic host of an american idollike reality show where according to caryn james of the new york times nothing is real  except the black hole at the centre of the hosts heart as mr grant takes mr cowells villainous act to its limit american dreamz failed financially but grant was generously praised he played his selfaggrandising character an amalgam of simon cowell and ryan seacrest with smarmy selfloathing the boston globe proposed that this just may be the great comic role that has always eluded hugh grant and critic carina chocano said he is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy in  grant starred opposite drew barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called music and lyrics the associated press described it as a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy thats simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough though he neither listens to music nor owns any cds grant learned to sing play the piano dance a few mannered steps and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a hasbeen pop singer based loosely on andrew ridgeley the lesserknown member of s pop duo wham the starledger dismissed the performance writing that paper dolls have more depth the film with its revenues totalling  million allowed grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washedup lead character according to the san francisco chronicle grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to alexs career hes too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed but hes far too brazen to feel anything like shame in  grant starred opposite sarah jessica parker in the marc lawrences romantic comedy did you hear about the morgans which was a critical failure but was a box office success he reunited with lawrence again for a dramedy film the rewrite starring opposite marisa tomei the film received mixedtopositive reviews while grants performance was praised by many critics director quentin tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called grant a perfect leading man in  he had a supporting role as alexander waverly in guy ritchies the man from uncle entertainment weekly described his performance as the only bit of fun in the film glenn kenny of rogerebertcom gave film a mixed review but stated that while it can’t be said that hugh grant saves the movie his return to prominence in the last halfhour after a plotseedingwalkon earlier in the movie peps things up considerably in  he played st clair bayfield partner of the title character in the film florence foster jenkins directed by stephen frears and starring meryl streep grants performance was raved by film critics as careerbest screen international one of his best performances in years indiewire best work of his career variety where he goes deeper darker and riskier places rolling stone rafer guzman of newsday said surely the yearold actor has just sealed his firstever oscar nomination carrie rickey of yahoo movies commented grant deserves the globe an oscar nomination and the recognition — finally — that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors grant was nominated for his first individual screen actors guild award and also earned nominations for a bafta a golden globe a critics choice award a satellite award and a european film award several critics have put his work among the best acting performances of the year most award pundits have predicted him to get his first academy award nomination for his performance but grant was not nominated grant will next appear as a villain in a family film paddington  screen rolesedit grant has predominantly been a comedy especially a romantic comedy actor for almost all of his mainstream film career he also never ventures to play characters who are not british while some film critics such as roger ebert have defended the limited variety of his performances others have dismissed him as a onetrick pony eric fellner coowner of working title films and a longtime collaborator of grant said his range hasnt been fully tested but each performance is unique a majority of grants popular films in the s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love often with an american woman in earlier films grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed englishman for humorous effects allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously these performances were sometimes deemed overbearing in the words of washington posts rita kempley due to his comic overreactions—the mugging the stuttering the fluttering eyelids she added hes got more tics than benny hill grants penchant for conveying his characters feelings with mannerisms rather than direct emotions has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style stephen hunter of the washington post once stated that to be effective as a comic performer he must get his jiving and shucking under control film historian david thomson wrote in the new biographical dictionary of film about how it is merely itchy mannerisms that grant equates with screen acting on his choice of roles grant has said “ ive never been tempted to do the part where i cry or get aids or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews i genuinely believe that comedy acting light comedy acting is as hard as if not harder than serious acting and it genuinely doesn’t bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by kneejerk reaction go to the deepest darkest most serious performances and parts it makes me laugh ” grants screen persona of later films in the new millennium gradually developed into a cynical selfloathing cad claudia puig of usa today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally gone were the selfconscious arent i adorable mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of grants film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes according to carina chocano amongst film critics the two tropes most commonly associated with grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in bridget joness diary and about a boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself nonetheless grant has occasionally acted in dramas he played a sleazy snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film an awfully big adventure which received critical praise and for a very quiet dignified performance as frédéric chopin in james lapines biopic film impromptu in  grant played six incredibly evil characters in the epic drama film cloud atlas an experience he has spoken about positively grant said “ i do a lot of killing and raping in the film but it was a laugh i thought before i read it that id turn it down which i normally do but i was interested in meeting cloud atlas codirectors the wachowskis because i have always admired them enormously and they are so charming and fascinating i slightly called my own bluff in one of the parts i am a cannibal about  years in the future and i thought i can do that its easy and then i am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in germany and they are saying you know hungry we must have that flesheating like a leopard who is so hungry and i am thinking i cant do that just give me a witty line ” personalityedit grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in popular media for his guarded privacy on probing of his personal life he has remained steadfast in offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough grant has described himself as a reluctant actor has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be a phase in his life lasting no more than ten years a  vogue profile of grant referred to him as a man with a professionally misanthropic mystique grant has expressed distaste for focus groups market research and emphasis on opening weekend boxoffice numbers saying its so destructive to the filmmaking process what was wrong with the way they used to release films more slowly let them build the director mike newell has said there is at least as much of hugh that is charismatic intellectual and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him thats gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy filmmaker paul weitz said that grant is funny and that he perceives flaws in himself and other people and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless british newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy grant is a selfconfessed committed and passionate perfectionist on a film set the american film critic dave kehr has written that grant is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role – someone who works hard to make it look easy – though that isnt a trait he admires in himself grant is noted by coworkers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard grant dropped his agent in  ending a year relationship with caa grant has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career theyve known for years that i have total control ive never taken any advice on anything in the mediaedit libel lawsuitsedit in  grant won substantial damages from news uk ltd over what his lawyers called a highly defamatory article published in january  the companys nowdefunct newspaper today had falsely claimed that grant verbally abused a young extra with a foulmouthed tongue lashing on the set of the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain on  april  grant accepted undisclosed damages from the associated newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles which were published in the daily mail and the mail on sunday on   and  february his lawyer stated that all of the articles allegations and factual assertions are false grant said in a written statement that he took the action because i was tired of the daily mail and mail on sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain he went on to take the opportunity to stress im also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the socalled close friends or close sources on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist legal troublesedit on  june  grant was arrested in los angeles california in a police vice operation not far from sunset boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from hollywood prostitute divine brown he pleaded no contest and was fined  placed on two years summary probation and was ordered to complete an aids education program by robert j sandoval the arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of grants first major studio film nine months which he was scheduled to promote on several american television shows the tonight show with jay leno had him booked for the same week in the muchwatched interview grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after leno asked him what the hell were you thinking grant answered i think you know in life whats a good thing to do and whats a bad thing and i did a bad thing and there you have it on larry king live grant declined host larry kings repeated invitations to probe his psyche saying that psychoanalysis was more of an american syndrome and he himself was a bit old fashioned he told the host i dont have excuses grant was appreciated for his refreshing honesty as he faced the music and handled it with tongue in cheek in april  grant was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo ian whittaker grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident charges were dropped on  june by the crown prosecution service on the grounds of insufficient evidence phone hacking exposéedit main article news of the world phone hacking affair in april  grant published an article in the new statesman entitled the bugger bugged about a conversation following an earlier encounter with paul mcmullan a former journalist and paparazzo for news of the world in unguarded comments which were secretly taped by grant mcmullan alleged that editors at the daily mail and news of the world particularly andy coulson had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior british politicians mcmullan also said that every british prime minister from margaret thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with rupert murdoch and his senior executives he stressed the friendship between david cameron and rebekah brooks née wade agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping and asserting that camerons inaction could be explained by selfinterest cameron is very much in debt to rebekah wade for helping him not quite win the election  so that was my submission to parliament – that camerons either a liar or an idiot when asked by grant whether cameron had encouraged the metropolitan police to drag their feet on investigating illegal phone tapping by murdochs journalists mcmullan agreed this had happened and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists  per cent of the met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks so why would they want to open up that can of worms and whats wrong with that anyway it doesnt hurt anyone particularly grants article attracted considerable interest due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation and the novelty of grant himself turning the tables on a tabloid journalist whilst the allegations regarding the news of the world continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media grant appeared for example on bbc radio  it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered millie dowler had been hacked and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public and eventually political outrage grant became something of a spokesman against murdochs news corporation culminating in a performance on bbc televisions

sexual obsession and cruelty by the washington post his other work in period pieces such as ken russells horror film the lair of the white worm  awardwinning merchantivory drama the remains of the day  and as frédéric chopin in impromptu  went largely unnoticed he later called this phase of his career hilarious referring to his early films as europuddings where you would have a french script a spanish director and english actors the script would usually be written by a foreigner badly translated into english and then theyd get english actors in because they thought that was the way to sell it to america at  grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of four weddings and a funeral fwaaf if you read as many bad scripts as i did youd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny he later recalled released in  fwaaf became the highestgrossing british film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of  million making grant an overnight international star the film was nominated for two academy awards and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew it earned grant his first and only golden globe award for best actor  motion picture musical or comedy and a bafta award for best actor in a leading role it also temporarily typecast him as the lead character charles a bohemian and debonair bachelor grant and curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star due to the parts he played was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter who is known for writing about himself and his own life grant later expressed “ although i owe whatever success ive had to four weddings and a funeral it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions one was that i was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth as im sure richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought thats all i could do i suppose because those films happened to be successful no one perhaps understandably  bothered to rent all the other films id done ” in july  grant signed a twoyear production deal with castle rock entertainment and by october he became founder and director of the ukbased simian films limited he appointed his thengirlfriend elizabeth hurley as the head of development to look for prospective projects simian films produced two grant vehicles in the s and lost a bid to produce about a boy to robert de niros tribeca productions the company closed its us office in  and grant resigned as director in december  grant was one of the choices to play james bond in s goldeneye but eventually lost out to pierce brosnan grants first studiofinanced hollywood project was chris columbuss comedy nine months though a hit at the box office it was almost universally panned by critics the washington post called it a grotesquely pandering caper and singled out grants performance as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriends unexpected pregnancy for his insufferable muggings the same year he played leading roles as emma thompsons suitor in ang lee’s academy awardwinning adaptation of jane austens sense and sensibility and as a cartographer in  wales in the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain in the same year he performed in the academy awardwinning restoration lisa schwarzbaum wrote grant is having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter and kevin thomas of los angeles times said he has some delicious moments in the film before the release of four weddings and a funeral grant reunited with its director mike newell for the tragicomedy an awfully big adventure that was labelled a determinedly offbeat film by the new york times grant portrayed a bitchy supercilious director of a repertory company in postworld war ii liverpool critic roger ebert wrote it shows that he has range as an actor but the san francisco chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film plays like a vanity production for grant janet maslin praising grant as superb and a dashing cad under any circumstances commented for him this film represents the road not taken made before four weddings and a funeral was released it captures mr grant as the clever versatile character actor he was then becoming rather than the international dreamboat he is today grant made his debut as a film producer with the  thriller extreme measures a commercial and critical failure though roger ebert and gene siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with siskel writing hugh grants work in extreme measures is a refreshing standout after a threeyear hiatus in  he paired with julia roberts in notting hill which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for four weddings and a funeral this new working title production displaced four weddings and a funeral as the biggest british hit in the history of cinema with earnings equalling  million worldwide as it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture the film was also received well by critics cnn reviewer paul clinton said notting hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds reactions to grants golden globenominated performance were varied with saloncoms stephanie zacharek criticising that grants performance stands as an emblem of whats wrong with notting hill whats maddening about grant is that he just never cuts the crap hes become one of those actors whos all shambling selfcaricature from his twinkly crows feet to the timelapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out the film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety most noted of which was grants turn as a fauxjournalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the new york times called a delightfully funny deadpan grant also released his second production output a fishoutofwater mob comedy mickey blue eyes that year it was dismissed by critics performed modestly at the box office and garnered its actorproducer mixed reviews for his starring role roger ebert thought hugh grant is wrong for the role and strikes one wrong note and then another whereas kenneth turan writing in the los angeles times said if hed been on the titanic fewer lives would have been lost if hed accompanied robert scott to the south pole the explorer would have lived to be  thats how good hugh grant is at rescuing doomed ventures while promoting woody allens small time crooks on nbcs the today show in  grant told host matt lauer its my millennium of bastards in  grant also joined the supervisory board of im internationalmedia ag the powerful munichbased film and media company small time crooks starred grant in the words of film critic andrew sarris as a petty petulant fauxpygmalion art dealer david who is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters mr allen has ever created in a role devoid of his comic attributes the new york times wrote mr grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation a year later his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher daniel cleaver in bridget joness diary  was proclaimed by variety to be as sly an overthrow of a stars polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory the film adapted from helen fieldings novel of the same name was an international hit earning  million worldwide grant was according to the washington post fitting as a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind the male gods countenance that he knows all too well grants immaculate comic performance bbc as the trustfunded womaniser will freeman in the film adaptation of nick hornbys bestselling novel about a boy received raves from critics almost universally praised with an academy awardnominated screenplay about a boy  was determined by the washington post to be that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishised coupledom and honesty over typical hollywood endings rolling stone wrote the acid comedy of grants performance carries the film and he gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs while roger ebert observed that the cary grant department is understaffed and hugh grant shows here that he is more than a star he is a resource released a day after the blockbuster star wars episode ii – attack of the clones about a boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful grant films making all of  million globally the film earned grant his third goldenglobe nomination while the london film critics circle named grant its best british actor and gq honoured him as one of the magazines men of the year  his performance can only be described as revelatory wrote critic ann hornaday adding that grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and selfawareness the new york observer concluded the film gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of hugh grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for wordsand with an english accent besides in the end the film comes over as a messy delight thanks to the skill generosity and goodsport punchingbag panache of mr grants performance about a boy also marked a notable change in grants boyish look now  he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair entertainment weeklys owen gleiberman took note of grants maturation in his review saying he looked noticeably older and that it looked good on him he added that grants pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn and the eyes that used to peer with love me cuteness now betray a sharks casual cunning everything about him is leaner and spikier including his hair which has been shorn and moussed into a eurochic bedhead mess but its not just his surface thats more virile the nervousness is gone too hugh grant has grown up holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherryclub mannerisms that were once his signature in doing so he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silvertongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency grant was also paired with sandra bullock in warner bross two weeks notice which made  million internationally but received poor reviews the village voice concluded that grants creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was little more than a britishism machine two weeks notice was followed by the  ensemble comedy love actually headlined by grant as the british prime minister a christmas release by working title films the film was promoted as the ultimate romantic comedy and accumulated  million at the international box office it marked the directorial debut of richard curtis who told the new york times that grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier curtis incarnations roger ebert claimed that grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian and has so much selfconfidence that he plays the british prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport film critic rex reed on the contrary called grants performance an oversexed bachelor spin on tony blair as the star flirted with himself in the paroxysm of selflove that has become his acting style in a  speech british prime minister tony blair referred to grants character in a speech saying i know theres a bit of us that would like me to do a hugh grant in love actually and tell america where to get off but the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life theres the next day the next year the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause grant in brussels october  in  grant reprised his role as daniel cleaver for a small part in bridget jones the edge of reason which like its predecessor made more than  million commercially gone from the screen for two years grant next reteamed with paul weitz about a boy for the black comedy american dreamz  grant starred as the acerbic host of an american idollike reality show where according to caryn james of the new york times nothing is real  except the black hole at the centre of the hosts heart as mr grant takes mr cowells villainous act to its limit american dreamz failed financially but grant was generously praised he played his selfaggrandising character an amalgam of simon cowell and ryan seacrest with smarmy selfloathing the boston globe proposed that this just may be the great comic role that has always eluded hugh grant and critic carina chocano said he is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy in  grant starred opposite drew barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called music and lyrics the associated press described it as a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy thats simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough though he neither listens to music nor owns any cds grant learned to sing play the piano dance a few mannered steps and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a hasbeen pop singer based loosely on andrew ridgeley the lesserknown member of s pop duo wham the starledger dismissed the performance writing that paper dolls have more depth the film with its revenues totalling  million allowed grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washedup lead character according to the san francisco chronicle grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to alexs career hes too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed but hes far too brazen to feel anything like shame in  grant starred opposite sarah jessica parker in the marc lawrences romantic comedy did you hear about the morgans which was a critical failure but was a box office success he reunited with lawrence again for a dramedy film the rewrite starring opposite marisa tomei the film received mixedtopositive reviews while grants performance was praised by many critics director quentin tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called grant a perfect leading man in  he had a supporting role as alexander waverly in guy ritchies the man from uncle entertainment weekly described his performance as the only bit of fun in the film glenn kenny of rogerebertcom gave film a mixed review but stated that while it can’t be said that hugh grant saves the movie his return to prominence in the last halfhour after a plotseedingwalkon earlier in the movie peps things up considerably in  he played st clair bayfield partner of the title character in the film florence foster jenkins directed by stephen frears and starring meryl streep grants performance was raved by film critics as careerbest screen international one of his best performances in years indiewire best work of his career variety where he goes deeper darker and riskier places rolling stone rafer guzman of newsday said surely the yearold actor has just sealed his firstever oscar nomination carrie rickey of yahoo movies commented grant deserves the globe an oscar nomination and the recognition — finally — that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors grant was nominated for his first individual screen actors guild award and also earned nominations for a bafta a golden globe a critics choice award a satellite award and a european film award several critics have put his work among the best acting performances of the year most award pundits have predicted him to get his first academy award nomination for his performance but grant was not nominated grant will next appear as a villain in a family film paddington  screen rolesedit grant has predominantly been a comedy especially a romantic comedy actor for almost all of his mainstream film career he also never ventures to play characters who are not british while some film critics such as roger ebert have defended the limited variety of his performances others have dismissed him as a onetrick pony eric fellner coowner of working title films and a longtime collaborator of grant said his range hasnt been fully tested but each performance is unique a majority of grants popular films in the s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love often with an american woman in earlier films grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed englishman for humorous effects allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously these performances were sometimes deemed overbearing in the words of washington posts rita kempley due to his comic overreactions—the mugging the stuttering the fluttering eyelids she added hes got more tics than benny hill grants penchant for conveying his characters feelings with mannerisms rather than direct emotions has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style stephen hunter of the washington post once stated that to be effective as a comic performer he must get his jiving and shucking under control film historian david thomson wrote in the new biographical dictionary of film about how it is merely itchy mannerisms that grant equates with screen acting on his choice of roles grant has said “ ive never been tempted to do the part where i cry or get aids or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews i genuinely believe that comedy acting light comedy acting is as hard as if not harder than serious acting and it genuinely doesn’t bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by kneejerk reaction go to the deepest darkest most serious performances and parts it makes me laugh ” grants screen persona of later films in the new millennium gradually developed into a cynical selfloathing cad claudia puig of usa today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally gone were the selfconscious arent i adorable mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of grants film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes according to carina chocano amongst film critics the two tropes most commonly associated with grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in bridget joness diary and about a boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself nonetheless grant has occasionally acted in dramas he played a sleazy snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film an awfully big adventure which received critical praise and for a very quiet dignified performance as frédéric chopin in james lapines biopic film impromptu in  grant played six incredibly evil characters in the epic drama film cloud atlas an experience he has spoken about positively grant said “ i do a lot of killing and raping in the film but it was a laugh i thought before i read it that id turn it down which i normally do but i was interested in meeting cloud atlas codirectors the wachowskis because i have always admired them enormously and they are so charming and fascinating i slightly called my own bluff in one of the parts i am a cannibal about  years in the future and i thought i can do that its easy and then i am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in germany and they are saying you know hungry we must have that flesheating like a leopard who is so hungry and i am thinking i cant do that just give me a witty line ” personalityedit grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in popular media for his guarded privacy on probing of his personal life he has remained steadfast in offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough grant has described himself as a reluctant actor has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be a phase in his life lasting no more than ten years a  vogue profile of grant referred to him as a man with a professionally misanthropic mystique grant has expressed distaste for focus groups market research and emphasis on opening weekend boxoffice numbers saying its so destructive to the filmmaking process what was wrong with the way they used to release films more slowly let them build the director mike newell has said there is at least as much of hugh that is charismatic intellectual and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him thats gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy filmmaker paul weitz said that grant is funny and that he perceives flaws in himself and other people and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless british newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy grant is a selfconfessed committed and passionate perfectionist on a film set the american film critic dave kehr has written that grant is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role – someone who works hard to make it look easy – though that isnt a trait he admires in himself grant is noted by coworkers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard grant dropped his agent in  ending a year relationship with caa grant has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career theyve known for years that i have total control ive never taken any advice on anything in the mediaedit libel lawsuitsedit in  grant won substantial damages from news uk ltd over what his lawyers called a highly defamatory article published in january  the companys nowdefunct newspaper today had falsely claimed that grant verbally abused a young extra with a foulmouthed tongue lashing on the set of the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain on  april  grant accepted undisclosed damages from the associated newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles which were published in the daily mail and the mail on sunday on   and  february his lawyer stated that all of the articles allegations and factual assertions are false grant said in a written statement that he took the action because i was tired of the daily mail and mail on sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain he went on to take the opportunity to stress im also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the socalled close friends or close sources on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist legal troublesedit on  june  grant was arrested in los angeles california in a police vice operation not far from sunset boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from hollywood prostitute divine brown he pleaded no contest and was fined  placed on two years summary probation and was ordered to complete an aids education program by robert j sandoval the arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of grants first major studio film nine months which he was scheduled to promote on several american television shows the tonight show with jay leno had him booked for the same week in the muchwatched interview grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after leno asked him what the hell were you thinking grant answered i think you know in life whats a good thing to do and whats a bad thing and i did a bad thing and there you have it on larry king live grant declined host larry kings repeated invitations to probe his psyche saying that psychoanalysis was more of an american syndrome and he himself was a bit old fashioned he told the host i dont have excuses grant was appreciated for his refreshing honesty as he faced the music and handled it with tongue in cheek in april  grant was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo ian whittaker grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident charges were dropped on  june by the crown prosecution service on the grounds of insufficient evidence phone hacking exposéedit main article news of the world phone hacking affair in april  grant published an article in the new statesman entitled the bugger bugged about a conversation following an earlier encounter with paul mcmullan a former journalist and paparazzo for news of the world in unguarded comments which were secretly taped by grant mcmullan alleged that editors at the daily mail and news of the world particularly andy coulson had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior british politicians mcmullan also said that every british prime minister from margaret thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with rupert murdoch and his senior executives he stressed the friendship between david cameron and rebekah brooks née wade agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping and asserting that camerons inaction could be explained by selfinterest cameron is very much in debt to rebekah wade for helping him not quite win the election  so that was my submission to parliament – that camerons either a liar or an idiot when asked by grant whether cameron had encouraged the metropolitan police to drag their feet on investigating illegal phone tapping by murdochs journalists mcmullan agreed this had happened and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists  per cent of the met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks so why would they want to open up that can of worms and whats wrong with that anyway it doesnt hurt anyone particularly grants article attracted considerable interest due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation and the novelty of grant himself turning the tables on a tabloid journalist whilst the allegations regarding the news of the world continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media grant appeared for example on bbc radio  it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered millie dowler had been hacked and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public and eventually political outrage grant became something of a spokesman against murdochs news corporation culminating in a performance on bbc televisions

is what ive been doing for the last  years personal lifeedit relationshipsedit grant during the second round of alfred dunhill links championship october  in  while playing lord byron in the spanish

spanish director and english actors the script would usually be written by a foreigner badly translated into english and then theyd get english actors in because they thought that was the way to sell

his own life grant later expressed “ although i owe whatever success ive had to four weddings and a funeral it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions one was that i was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth as im sure richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought thats all i could do i suppose because those films happened to be successful no one perhaps understandably  bothered to rent all the other films id done ” in july  grant signed a twoyear production deal with castle rock entertainment and by october he became founder and director of the ukbased simian films limited he appointed his thengirlfriend elizabeth hurley as the head of development to look for prospective projects simian films

was one of the choices to play james bond in s goldeneye but eventually lost out to pierce brosnan grants first studiofinanced hollywood project was chris columbuss comedy nine months though a hit at the box office it was almost universally panned by critics the washington post called it a grotesquely pandering caper and singled out grants performance as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriends unexpected pregnancy for his insufferable muggings the same year he played leading roles as emma thompsons suitor in ang lee’s academy awardwinning adaptation of jane austens sense and sensibility and as a cartographer in  wales in the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain in the same year he performed in the academy awardwinning restoration lisa schwarzbaum wrote grant is having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter and kevin thomas of los angeles times said he has some delicious moments in the film before the release of four weddings and a funeral grant reunited with its director mike newell for the tragicomedy an awfully big adventure that was labelled a determinedly offbeat film by the new york times grant portrayed a bitchy supercilious director of a repertory company in postworld war ii liverpool critic roger ebert wrote it shows that he has range as an actor but the san francisco chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film plays like a vanity production for grant janet maslin praising grant as superb and a dashing cad under any circumstances commented for him this film represents the road not taken made before four weddings and a funeral was released it captures mr grant as the clever versatile character actor he was then becoming rather than the international dreamboat he is today grant made his debut as a film producer with the  thriller extreme measures a commercial and critical failure though roger ebert and gene siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with siskel writing hugh grants work in extreme measures is a refreshing standout after a threeyear hiatus in  he paired with julia roberts in notting hill which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for four weddings and a funeral this new working title production displaced four weddings and a funeral as the biggest british hit in the history of cinema with earnings equalling  million worldwide as it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture the film was also received well by critics cnn reviewer paul clinton said notting hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds reactions to grants golden globenominated performance were varied with saloncoms stephanie zacharek criticising that grants performance stands as an emblem of whats wrong with notting hill whats maddening about grant is that he just never cuts the crap hes become one of those actors whos all shambling selfcaricature from his twinkly crows feet to the timelapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out the film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety most noted of which was grants turn as a fauxjournalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the new york times called a delightfully funny deadpan grant also released his second production output a fishoutofwater mob comedy mickey blue eyes that year it was dismissed by critics performed modestly at the box office and garnered its actorproducer mixed reviews for his starring role roger ebert thought hugh grant is wrong for the role and strikes one wrong note and then another whereas kenneth turan writing in the los angeles times said if hed been on the titanic fewer lives would have been lost if hed accompanied robert scott to the south pole the explorer would have lived to be  thats how good hugh grant is at rescuing doomed ventures while promoting woody allens small time crooks on nbcs the today show in  grant told host matt lauer its my millennium of bastards in  grant also joined the supervisory board of im internationalmedia ag the powerful munichbased film and media company small time crooks starred grant in the words of film critic andrew sarris as a petty petulant fauxpygmalion art dealer david who is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters mr allen has ever created in a role devoid of his comic attributes the new york times wrote mr grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation a year later his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher daniel cleaver in bridget joness diary  was proclaimed by variety to be as sly an overthrow of a stars polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory the film adapted from helen fieldings novel of the same name was an international hit earning  million worldwide grant was according to the washington post fitting as a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind the male gods countenance that he knows all too well grants immaculate comic performance bbc as the trustfunded womaniser will freeman in the film adaptation of nick hornbys bestselling novel about a boy received raves from critics almost universally praised with an academy awardnominated screenplay about a boy  was determined by the washington post to be that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishised coupledom and honesty over typical hollywood endings rolling stone wrote the acid comedy of grants performance carries the film and he gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs while roger ebert observed that the cary grant department is understaffed and hugh grant shows here that he is more than a star he is a resource released a day after the blockbuster star wars episode ii – attack of the clones about a boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful grant films making all of  million globally the film earned grant his third goldenglobe nomination while the london film critics circle named grant its best british actor and gq honoured him as one of the magazines men of the year  his performance can only be described as revelatory wrote critic ann hornaday adding that grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and selfawareness the new york observer concluded the film gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of hugh grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for wordsand with an english accent besides in the end the film comes over as a messy delight thanks to the skill generosity and goodsport punchingbag panache of mr grants performance about a boy also marked a notable change in grants boyish look now  he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair entertainment weeklys owen gleiberman took note of grants maturation in his review saying he looked noticeably older and that it looked good on him he added that grants pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn and the eyes that used to peer with love me cuteness now betray a sharks casual cunning everything about him is leaner and spikier including his hair which has been shorn and moussed into a eurochic bedhead mess but its not just his surface thats more virile the nervousness is gone too hugh grant has grown up holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherryclub mannerisms that were once his signature in doing so he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silvertongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency grant was also paired with sandra bullock in warner bross two weeks notice which made  million internationally but received poor reviews the village voice concluded that grants creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was little more than a britishism machine two weeks notice was followed by the  ensemble comedy love actually headlined by grant as the british prime minister a christmas release by working title films the film was promoted as the ultimate romantic comedy and accumulated  million at the international box office it marked the directorial debut of richard curtis who told the new york times that grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier curtis incarnations roger ebert claimed that grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian and has so much selfconfidence that he plays the british prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport film critic rex reed on the contrary called grants performance an oversexed bachelor spin on tony blair as the star flirted with himself in the paroxysm of selflove that has become his acting style in a  speech british prime minister tony blair referred to grants character in a speech saying i know theres a bit of us that would like me to do a hugh grant in love actually and tell america where to get off but the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life theres the next day the next year the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause grant in brussels october  in  grant reprised his role as daniel cleaver for a small part in bridget jones the edge of reason which like its predecessor made more than  million commercially gone from the screen for two years grant next reteamed with paul weitz about a boy for the black comedy american dreamz  grant starred as the acerbic host of an american idollike reality show where according to caryn james of the new york times nothing is real  except the black hole at the centre of the hosts heart as mr grant takes mr cowells villainous act to its limit american dreamz failed financially but grant was generously praised he played his selfaggrandising character an amalgam of simon cowell and ryan seacrest with smarmy selfloathing the boston globe proposed that this just may be the great comic role that has always eluded hugh grant and critic carina chocano said he is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy in  grant starred opposite drew barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called music and lyrics the associated press described it as a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy thats simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough though he neither listens to music nor owns any cds grant learned to sing play the piano dance a few mannered steps and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a hasbeen pop singer based loosely on andrew ridgeley the lesserknown member of s pop duo wham the starledger dismissed the performance writing that paper dolls have more depth the film with its revenues totalling  million allowed grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washedup lead character according to the san francisco chronicle grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to alexs career hes too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed but hes far too brazen to feel anything like shame in  grant starred opposite sarah jessica parker in the marc lawrences romantic comedy did you hear about the morgans which was a critical failure but was a box office success he reunited with lawrence again for a dramedy film the rewrite starring opposite marisa tomei the film received mixedtopositive reviews while grants performance was praised by many critics director quentin tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called grant a perfect leading man in  he had a supporting role as alexander waverly in guy ritchies the man from uncle entertainment weekly described his performance as the only bit of fun in the film glenn kenny of rogerebertcom gave film a mixed review but stated that while it can’t be said that hugh grant saves the movie his return to prominence in the last halfhour after a plotseedingwalkon earlier in the movie peps things up considerably in  he played st clair bayfield partner of the title character in the film florence foster jenkins directed by stephen frears and starring meryl streep grants performance was raved by film critics as careerbest screen international one of his best performances in years indiewire best work of his career variety where he goes deeper darker and riskier places rolling stone rafer guzman of newsday said surely the yearold actor has just sealed his firstever oscar nomination carrie rickey of yahoo movies commented grant deserves the globe an oscar nomination and the recognition — finally — that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors grant was nominated for his first individual screen actors guild award and also earned nominations for a bafta a golden globe a critics choice award a satellite award and a european film award several critics have put his work among the best acting performances of the year most award pundits have predicted him to get his first academy award nomination for his performance but grant was not nominated grant will next appear as a villain in a family film paddington  screen rolesedit grant has predominantly been a comedy especially a romantic comedy actor for almost all of his mainstream film career he also never ventures to play characters who are not british while some film critics such as roger ebert have defended the limited variety of his performances others have dismissed him as a onetrick pony eric fellner coowner of working title films and a longtime collaborator of grant said his range hasnt been fully tested but each performance is unique a majority of grants popular films in the s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love often with an american woman in earlier films grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed englishman for humorous effects allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously these performances were sometimes deemed overbearing in the words of washington posts rita kempley due to his comic overreactions—the mugging the stuttering the fluttering eyelids she added hes got more tics than benny hill grants penchant for conveying his characters feelings with mannerisms rather than direct emotions has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style stephen hunter of the washington post once stated that to be effective as a comic performer he must get his jiving and shucking under control film historian david thomson wrote in the new biographical dictionary of film about how it is merely itchy mannerisms that grant equates with screen acting on his choice of roles grant has said “ ive never been tempted to do the part where i cry or get aids or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews i genuinely believe that comedy acting light comedy acting is as hard as if not harder than serious acting and it genuinely doesn’t bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by kneejerk reaction go to the deepest darkest most serious performances and parts it makes me laugh ” grants screen persona of later films in the new millennium gradually developed into a cynical selfloathing cad claudia puig of usa today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally gone were the selfconscious arent i adorable mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of grants film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes according to carina chocano amongst film critics the two tropes most commonly associated with grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in bridget joness diary and about a boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself nonetheless grant has occasionally acted in dramas he played a sleazy snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film an awfully big adventure which received critical praise and for a very quiet dignified performance as frédéric chopin in james lapines biopic film impromptu in  grant played six incredibly evil characters in the epic drama film cloud atlas an experience he has spoken about positively grant said “ i do a lot of killing and raping in the film but it was a laugh i thought before i read it that id turn it down which i normally do but i was interested in meeting cloud atlas codirectors the wachowskis because i have always admired them enormously and they are so charming and fascinating i slightly called my own bluff in one of the parts i am a cannibal about  years in the future and i thought i can do that its easy and then i am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in germany and they are saying you know hungry we must have that flesheating like a leopard who is so hungry and i am thinking i cant do that just give me a witty line ” personalityedit grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in popular media for his guarded privacy on probing of his personal life he has remained steadfast in offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough grant has described himself as a reluctant actor has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be a phase in his life lasting no more than ten years a  vogue profile of grant referred to him as a man with a professionally misanthropic mystique grant has expressed distaste for focus groups market research and emphasis on opening weekend boxoffice numbers saying its so destructive to the filmmaking process what was wrong with the way they used to release films more slowly let them build the director mike newell has said there is at least as much of hugh that is charismatic intellectual and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him thats gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy filmmaker paul weitz said that grant is funny and that he perceives flaws in himself and other people and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless british newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy grant is a selfconfessed committed and passionate perfectionist on a film set the american film critic dave kehr has written that grant is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role – someone who works hard to make it look easy – though that isnt a trait he admires in himself grant is noted by coworkers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard grant dropped his agent in  ending a year relationship with caa grant has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career theyve known for years that i have total control ive never taken any advice on anything in the mediaedit libel lawsuitsedit in  grant won substantial damages from news uk ltd over what his lawyers called a highly defamatory article published in january  the companys nowdefunct newspaper today had falsely claimed that grant verbally abused a young extra with a foulmouthed tongue lashing on the set of the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain on  april  grant accepted undisclosed damages from the associated newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles which were published in the daily mail and the mail on sunday on   and  february his lawyer stated that all of the articles allegations and factual assertions are false grant said in a written statement that he took the action because i was tired of the daily mail and mail on sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain he went on to take the opportunity to stress im also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the socalled close friends or close sources on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist legal troublesedit on  june  grant was arrested in los angeles california in a police vice operation not far from sunset boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from hollywood prostitute divine brown he pleaded no contest and was fined  placed on two years summary probation and was ordered to complete an aids education program by robert j sandoval the arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of grants first major studio film nine months which he was scheduled to promote on several american television shows the tonight show with jay leno had him booked for the same week in the muchwatched interview grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after leno asked him what the hell were you thinking grant answered i think you know in life whats a good thing to do and whats a bad thing and i did a bad thing and there you have it on larry king live grant declined host larry kings repeated invitations to probe his psyche saying that psychoanalysis was more of an american syndrome and he himself was a bit old fashioned he told the host i dont have excuses grant was appreciated for his refreshing honesty as he faced the music and handled it with tongue in cheek in april  grant was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo ian whittaker grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident charges were dropped on  june by the crown prosecution service on the grounds of insufficient evidence phone hacking exposéedit main article news of the world phone hacking affair in april  grant published an article in the new statesman entitled the bugger bugged about a conversation following an earlier encounter with paul mcmullan a former journalist and paparazzo for news of the world in unguarded comments which were secretly taped by grant mcmullan alleged that editors at the daily mail and news of the world particularly andy coulson had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior british politicians mcmullan also said that every british prime minister from margaret thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with rupert murdoch and his senior executives he stressed the friendship between david cameron and rebekah brooks née wade agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping and asserting that camerons inaction could be explained by selfinterest cameron is very much in debt to rebekah wade for helping him not quite win the election  so that was my submission to parliament – that camerons either a liar or an idiot when asked by grant whether cameron had encouraged the metropolitan police to drag their feet on investigating illegal phone tapping by murdochs journalists mcmullan agreed this had happened and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists  per cent of the met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks so why would they want to open up that can of worms and whats wrong with that anyway it doesnt hurt anyone particularly grants article attracted considerable interest due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation and the novelty of grant himself turning the tables on a tabloid journalist whilst the allegations regarding the news of the world continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media grant appeared for example on bbc radio  it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered millie dowler had been hacked and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public and eventually political outrage grant became something of a spokesman against murdochs news corporation culminating in a performance on bbc televisions

is what ive been doing for the last  years personal lifeedit relationshipsedit grant during the second round of alfred dunhill links championship october  in  while playing lord byron in the spanish

spanish director and english actors the script would usually be written by a foreigner badly translated into english and then theyd get english actors in because they thought that was the way to sell it to america at  grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of four weddings and a funeral fwaaf if you read as many bad scripts as i did youd

debonair bachelor grant and curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star due to the parts he played was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter who is known for writing about himself and his own life grant later expressed “ although i owe whatever success ive had to four weddings and a funeral it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions one was that i was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth as im sure richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought thats all i could do i suppose because those films happened to be successful no one perhaps understandably  bothered to rent all the other films id done ” in july  grant signed a twoyear production deal with castle rock entertainment and by october he became founder and director of the ukbased simian films limited he appointed his thengirlfriend elizabeth hurley as the head of development to look for prospective projects simian films

was one of the choices to play james bond in s goldeneye but eventually lost out to pierce brosnan grants first studiofinanced hollywood project was chris columbuss comedy nine months though a hit at the box office it was almost universally panned by critics the washington post called it a grotesquely pandering caper and singled out grants performance as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriends unexpected pregnancy for his insufferable muggings the same year he played leading roles as emma thompsons suitor in ang lee’s academy awardwinning adaptation of jane austens sense and sensibility and as a cartographer in  wales in the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain in the same year he performed in the academy awardwinning restoration lisa schwarzbaum wrote grant is having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter and kevin thomas of los angeles times said he has some delicious moments in the film before the release of four weddings and a funeral grant reunited with its director mike newell for the tragicomedy an awfully big adventure that was labelled a determinedly offbeat film by the new york times grant portrayed a bitchy supercilious director of a repertory company in postworld war ii liverpool critic roger ebert wrote it shows that he has range as an actor but the san francisco chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film plays like a vanity production for grant janet maslin praising grant as superb and a dashing cad under any circumstances commented for him this film represents the road not taken made before four weddings and a funeral was released it captures mr grant as the clever versatile character actor he was then becoming rather than the international dreamboat he is today grant made his debut as a film producer with the  thriller extreme measures a commercial and critical failure though roger ebert and gene siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with siskel writing hugh grants work in extreme measures is a refreshing standout after a threeyear hiatus in  he paired with julia roberts in notting hill which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for four weddings and a funeral this new working title production displaced four weddings and a funeral as the biggest british hit in the history of cinema with earnings equalling  million worldwide as it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture the film was also received well by critics cnn reviewer paul clinton said notting hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds reactions to grants golden globenominated performance were varied with saloncoms stephanie zacharek criticising that grants performance stands as an emblem of whats wrong with notting hill whats maddening about grant is that he just never cuts the crap hes become one of those actors whos all shambling selfcaricature from his twinkly crows feet to the timelapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out the film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety most noted of which was grants turn as a fauxjournalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the new york times called a delightfully funny deadpan grant also released his second production output a fishoutofwater mob comedy mickey blue eyes that year it was dismissed by critics performed modestly at the box office and garnered its actorproducer mixed reviews for his starring role roger ebert thought hugh grant is wrong for the role and strikes one wrong note and then another whereas kenneth turan writing in the los angeles times said if hed been on the titanic fewer lives would have been lost if hed accompanied robert scott to the south pole the explorer would have lived to be  thats how good hugh grant is at rescuing doomed ventures while promoting woody allens small time crooks on nbcs the today show in  grant told host matt lauer its my millennium of bastards in  grant also joined the supervisory board of im internationalmedia ag the powerful munichbased film and media company small time crooks starred grant in the words of film critic andrew sarris as a petty petulant fauxpygmalion art dealer david who is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters mr allen has ever created in a role devoid of his comic attributes the new york times wrote mr grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation a year later his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher daniel cleaver in bridget joness diary  was proclaimed by variety to be as sly an overthrow of a stars polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory the film adapted from helen fieldings novel of the same name was an international hit earning  million worldwide grant was according to the washington post fitting as a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind the male gods countenance that he knows all too well grants immaculate comic performance bbc as the trustfunded womaniser will freeman in the film adaptation of nick hornbys bestselling novel about a boy received raves from critics almost universally praised with an academy awardnominated screenplay about a boy  was determined by the washington post to be that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishised coupledom and honesty over typical hollywood endings rolling stone wrote the acid comedy of grants performance carries the film and he gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs while roger ebert observed that the cary grant department is understaffed and hugh grant shows here that he is more than a star he is a resource released a day after the blockbuster star wars episode ii – attack of the clones about a boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful grant films making all of  million globally the film earned grant his third goldenglobe nomination while the london film critics circle named grant its best british actor and gq honoured him as one of the magazines men of the year  his performance can only be described as revelatory wrote critic ann hornaday adding that grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and selfawareness the new york observer concluded the film gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of hugh grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for wordsand with an english accent besides in the end the film comes over as a messy delight thanks to the skill generosity and goodsport punchingbag panache of mr grants performance about a boy also marked a notable change in grants boyish look now  he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair entertainment weeklys owen gleiberman took note of grants maturation in his review saying he looked noticeably older and that it looked good on him he added that grants pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn and the eyes that used to peer with love me cuteness now betray a sharks casual cunning everything about him is leaner and spikier including his hair which has been shorn and moussed into a eurochic bedhead mess but its not just his surface thats more virile the nervousness is gone too hugh grant has grown up holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherryclub mannerisms that were once his signature in doing so he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silvertongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency grant was also paired with sandra bullock in warner bross two weeks notice which made  million internationally but received poor reviews the village voice concluded that grants creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was little more than a britishism machine two weeks notice was followed by the  ensemble comedy love actually headlined by grant as the british prime minister a christmas release by working title films the film was promoted as the ultimate romantic comedy and accumulated  million at the international box office it marked the directorial debut of richard curtis who told the new york times that grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier curtis incarnations roger ebert claimed that grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian and has so much selfconfidence that he plays the british prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport film critic rex reed on the contrary called grants performance an oversexed bachelor spin on tony blair as the star flirted with himself in the paroxysm of selflove that has become his acting style in a  speech british prime minister tony blair referred to grants character in a speech saying i know theres a bit of us that would like me to do a hugh grant in love actually and tell america where to get off but the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life theres the next day the next year the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause grant in brussels october  in  grant reprised his role as daniel cleaver for a small part in bridget jones the edge of reason which like its predecessor made more than  million commercially gone from the screen for two years grant next reteamed with paul weitz about a boy for the black comedy american dreamz  grant starred as the acerbic host of an american idollike reality show where according to caryn james of the new york times nothing is real  except the black hole at the centre of the hosts heart as mr grant takes mr cowells villainous act to its limit american dreamz failed financially but grant was generously praised he played his selfaggrandising character an amalgam of simon cowell and ryan seacrest with smarmy selfloathing the boston globe proposed that this just may be the great comic role that has always eluded hugh grant and critic carina chocano said he is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy in  grant starred opposite drew barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called music and lyrics the associated press described it as a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy thats simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough though he neither listens to music nor owns any cds grant learned to sing play the piano dance a few mannered steps and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a hasbeen pop singer based loosely on andrew ridgeley the lesserknown member of s pop duo wham the starledger dismissed the performance writing that paper dolls have more depth the film with its revenues totalling  million allowed grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washedup lead character according to the san francisco chronicle grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to alexs career hes too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed but hes far too brazen to feel anything like shame in  grant starred opposite sarah jessica parker in the marc lawrences romantic comedy did you hear about the morgans which was a critical failure but was a box office success he reunited with lawrence again for a dramedy film the rewrite starring opposite marisa tomei the film received mixedtopositive reviews while grants performance was praised by many critics director quentin tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called grant a perfect leading man in  he had a supporting role as alexander waverly in guy ritchies the man from uncle entertainment weekly described his performance as the only bit of fun in the film glenn kenny of rogerebertcom gave film a mixed review but stated that while it can’t be said that hugh grant saves the movie his return to prominence in the last halfhour after a plotseedingwalkon earlier in the movie peps things up considerably in  he played st clair bayfield partner of the title character in the film florence foster jenkins directed by stephen frears and starring meryl streep grants performance was raved by film critics as careerbest screen international one of his best performances in years indiewire best work of his career variety where he goes deeper darker and riskier places rolling stone rafer guzman of newsday said surely the yearold actor has just sealed his firstever oscar nomination carrie rickey of yahoo movies commented grant deserves the globe an oscar nomination and the recognition — finally — that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors grant was nominated for his first individual screen actors guild award and also earned nominations for a bafta a golden globe a critics choice award a satellite award and a european film award several critics have put his work among the best acting performances of the year most award pundits have predicted him to get his first academy award nomination for his performance but grant was not nominated grant will next appear as a villain in a family film paddington  screen rolesedit grant has predominantly been a comedy especially a romantic comedy actor for almost all of his mainstream film career he also never ventures to play characters who are not british while some film critics such as roger ebert have defended the limited variety of his performances others have dismissed him as a onetrick pony eric fellner coowner of working title films and a longtime collaborator of grant said his range hasnt been fully tested but each performance is unique a majority of grants popular films in the s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love often with an american woman in earlier films grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed englishman for humorous effects allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously these performances were sometimes deemed overbearing in the words of washington posts rita kempley due to his comic overreactions—the mugging the stuttering the fluttering eyelids she added hes got more tics than benny hill grants penchant for conveying his characters feelings with mannerisms rather than direct emotions has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style stephen hunter of the washington post once stated that to be effective as a comic performer he must get his jiving and shucking under control film historian david thomson wrote in the new biographical dictionary of film about how it is merely itchy mannerisms that grant equates with screen acting on his choice of roles grant has said “ ive never been tempted to do the part where i cry or get aids or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews i genuinely believe that comedy acting light comedy acting is as hard as if not harder than serious acting and it genuinely doesn’t bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by kneejerk reaction go to the deepest darkest most serious performances and parts it makes me laugh ” grants screen persona of later films in the new millennium gradually developed into a cynical selfloathing cad claudia puig of usa today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally gone were the selfconscious arent i adorable mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of grants film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes according to carina chocano amongst film critics the two tropes most commonly associated with grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in bridget joness diary and about a boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself nonetheless grant has occasionally acted in dramas he played a sleazy snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film an awfully big adventure which received critical praise and for a very quiet dignified performance as frédéric chopin in james lapines biopic film impromptu in  grant played six incredibly evil characters in the epic drama film cloud atlas an experience he has spoken about positively grant said “ i do a lot of killing and raping in the film but it was a laugh i thought before i read it that id turn it down which i normally do but i was interested in meeting cloud atlas codirectors the wachowskis because i have always admired them enormously and they are so charming and fascinating i slightly called my own bluff in one of the parts i am a cannibal about  years in the future and i thought i can do that its easy and then i am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in germany and they are saying you know hungry we must have that flesheating like a leopard who is so hungry and i am thinking i cant do that just give me a witty line ” personalityedit grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in popular media for his guarded privacy on probing of his personal life he has remained steadfast in offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough grant has described himself as a reluctant actor has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be a phase in his life lasting no more than ten years a  vogue profile of grant referred to him as a man with a professionally misanthropic mystique grant has expressed distaste for focus groups market research and emphasis on opening weekend boxoffice numbers saying its so destructive to the filmmaking process what was wrong with the way they used to release films more slowly let them build the director mike newell has said there is at least as much of hugh that is charismatic intellectual and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him thats gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy filmmaker paul weitz said that grant is funny and that he perceives flaws in himself and other people and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless british newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy grant is a selfconfessed committed and passionate perfectionist on a film set the american film critic dave kehr has written that grant is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role – someone who works hard to make it look easy – though that isnt a trait he admires in himself grant is noted by coworkers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard grant dropped his

took the action because i was tired of the daily mail and mail on sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain he went on to take the

entitled the bugger bugged about a conversation following an earlier encounter with paul mcmullan a former journalist and paparazzo for news of the world in unguarded comments which were secretly taped by grant mcmullan alleged that editors at the daily mail and news of the world particularly andy coulson had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior british politicians mcmullan also said that every british prime minister from margaret thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with rupert murdoch and his senior executives he stressed the friendship between david cameron and rebekah brooks née wade agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping and asserting that camerons inaction could be explained by selfinterest cameron is very much in debt to rebekah wade for helping him not quite win the election  so that was my submission to parliament – that camerons either a liar or an idiot when asked by grant whether cameron had encouraged the metropolitan police to drag their feet on investigating illegal phone tapping by murdochs journalists mcmullan agreed this had happened and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists  per cent of the met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks so why would they want to open up that can of worms and whats wrong with that anyway it doesnt hurt anyone particularly grants article attracted considerable interest due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation and the novelty of grant himself turning the tables on a tabloid journalist whilst the allegations regarding the news of the world continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media grant appeared for example on bbc radio  it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered millie dowler had been hacked and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted that the coverage turned
