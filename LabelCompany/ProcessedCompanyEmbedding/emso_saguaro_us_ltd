main driver of emsos investment philosophy is to generate alpha by targeting idiosyncratic opportunities which are identified based on the teams long experience in emerging markets investing emsos investment thesis is premised on structural inefficiencies in emerging markets which emso believes still persist despite dramatic improvement in emerging market fundamentals over the past  years emso seeks to capture high quality riskadjusted returns by investing across asset classes within the emerging market universe with a focus on fixed income the investment strategy is distinctly valueoriented based on fundamental country and company analysis combined with securityspecific financial and legal analysis with regard to portfolio construction emso focuses on a small number of high conviction themes typically around ten the team develops these themes by performing deep fundamental research and analysis on countries and corporates and selects those underlying assets that appear to offer the best investment opportunities the team aims to achieve this through a defensive investment strategy constructing trades with a focus on protection against potential downside risks and liquidity constraints in addition the team tends to use macro tailrisk hedge overlays in order to reduce the impact of sudden movements in global risk premiums and liquidity
