matl mdll midu sytl ustby zacks fundszacks funds fund holdings etf investingzackscomthe direxion shares etf trust has decided to cease trading three of its leveraged products after the closing session on october   the decision based on the recommendation of the funds sponsor rafferty asset management llc was taken due to the funds inability to attract sufficient investment assets we believe strong competition in the asset class and pitfalls of investing in leveraged etfs in this turbulent time with high volatility might have kept investors away from these funds leveraged etfs are designed to magnify returns of the underlying index however these products lose their asset value during a highly volatile market environment particularly in the long term further their performances could vary significantly from the actual performance of their underlying index over a longer period when compared to a shorter period such as weeks or months read understanding leveraged etfs lets discuss the three products serving divergent interests which are about to be closed down see all leveraged equity etfs here direxion daily  year treasury bull x shares etf nysearcasytl sytl tracks the nyse  year treasury bond index which is a multiplesecurity fixed income index that aims to track the total returns of the intermediate  to  year maturity range of the us treasury bond market this product provides two times x exposure to the daily performance of the underlying index the fund has been overlooked by investors as it has garnered only  million in assets since its inception in july last year it charges  bps in annual fees from investors however the product gained  so far this year the closure of this etf seems unfortunate at a time when investors are flocking toward bond etfs due to global stock market instability and feds reluctance to raise interest rates in the near term as lower rates push the yields down boosting the prices for the bonds investors still interested to play the leveraged treasury bond etf category could consider the more popular proshares ultra  year treasury etf nysearcaust which provides two times exposure to the barclays capital us  year treasury index this product has roughly  million in aum and charges  bps in fees the fund returned  in the yeartodate timeframe direxion daily mid cap bull x shares etf nysearcamdll mdll follows the sp mid cap  index measuring the performance of the midcap segment of the us equity universe it seeks daily investment results of  of the performance of the benchmark index the fund is almost neglected gathering a meager  million in assets since its inception in july last year it charges  bps in fees from investors and was down  in the yeartodate period the closure of this fund doesnt look good either at a time when midcap funds are favored by investors due to their potential to move higher in difficult times especially if political issues or financial instability creep into the picture investors still interested in leveraged midcap etfs could consider the direxion daily mid cap bull x shares etf nysearcamidu by the same issuer the fund seeks investment results of  of the price performance of the sp mid cap  index it has  million in aum and charges  bps in fees the fund lost  so far this year direxion daily basic materials bull x shares etf nysearcamatl matl tracks the materials select sector index which includes companies from the chemicals metals  mining paper  forest products containers  packaging and construction materials industries it provides three times x exposure to the daily performance of the underlying index the fund was hardly noticed by investors as it has accumulated only  million in assets since its launch in june  it charges  bps in annual fees from investors the basic materials sector has been dragged down by weak agricultural fundamentals sluggish demand in energy markets and persistent slowdown in china  the worlds second largest consumer of raw materials
