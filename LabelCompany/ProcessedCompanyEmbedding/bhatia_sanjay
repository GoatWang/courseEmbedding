degrees in electrical engineering from virginia tech university check out the hpe  intel open nfv ecosystem webinar featuring genband where sanjay bhatia demonstrates some of genband’s high performance virtualized network functions vnfs such as session border controller and advanced media software ams utilized for multiple applications such as volte mrf volte interconnects vims ip exchange ipx and sip trunking genband primarily focuses on vnf offerings for voice over lte volte sbc analytics and other real time communications solutions for carriers to succeed with network functions virtualization nfv these vnfs need to be hosted on carriergrade nfvi and appropriately orchestrated with a strong mano offering what’s your recommendation to carriers on this bhatia yes genband provides high performance vnf offerings to global service providers for nfvbased deployments for multiple applications and services these genband vnfs include a distributed advanced control software acs vnf for session border controllers an advanced media software ams vnf for volte  fixed network media interworking and transcoding a media control vnf for ims mrf and mgcf applications and an intelligent messaging vnf to name a few genband also offers a vnf manager a key component of the etsi mano architecture for lifecycle management automation and elasticity of genband and third party vnfs our vnf portfolio is hosted on carriergrade nfvi and orchestrated in the telco cloud with our ecosystem partner offerings genband works with a broad ecosystem of partners for carriergrade nfvi and orchestration some of our key ecosystem partners for nfvi include hpe with hpe helion carrier grade wind river titanium and intel for their technology and architecture genband has teamed with intel and hpe to offer differentiated nfv can you tell us more about this partnership and the nature of differentiation bhatia genband is a key member of the hpe opennfv ecosystem as well as the intel network builders ecosystem as part of these two important ecosystems we work very closely with these two vendors and the broader ecosystems to create high performance and carrierclass nfv solutions for service providers so that they can provide innovative new services such as  volte and internet of things iot quickly and efficiently to their end customers ensuring great enduser experiences our kandy cloud communications platform enables real time communications capabilities for iot applications we work with intel to provide high performance vnfs  an example of this collaboration with intel is our work together on our advanced media software ams vnf which is utilized for media interworking and transcoding in volte and other networks the ams vnf is fully software based and implemented  percent on intel architecture we work closely with intel to characterize and optimize the ams vnf’s performance for the telco cloud genband has great media processing expertise and working with market leaders like intel allows us to jointly bring to market bestinclass solutions for our service provider customers volte and iot require carrierscale nfvbased realtime communications services how is genband making this possible bhatia nfvbased services such as volte and iot have to address scale and this is really nonnegotiable carriers are not strangers to providing high scale and high reliability services to customers on their networks hence nfvbased services have to provide carrier class and at carrier scale genband is making this possible by enabling carrier class capabilities for solutions at all layers of nfv architecture this means that the nfvi has to be carrier class and our ecosystem partners like hpe certainly provide that capability it also means that the vnfs have to be carrier class and our full vnf portfolio architectures support full redundancy with high reliability genband is known for our large scale deployments in major tier  service providers – so we really understand carrier class well for example genband already has multiple deployments in large volte networks all exceeding  million subscribers we hear vendors using the words “cloudnative” quite often can you explain to us what a cloud native vnf is and why should service providers care about that bhatia virtualization of telecommunication network functions is not a new phenomenon and has been done for a long time traditionally a monolithic nonmodular approach has been used where an entire software application for the network function runs in its own virtual machine vm on a shared off the shelf platform while this approach does enable service providers to transition from proprietary platform to an off the shelf platform and optimize their compute resources of a single server node it falls short on many grounds when compared to nfv cloudbased deployment dynamic ondemand scalability fully automated deployments multivnf service chaining multicloud georedundancy selfhealing under failures and multitenancy across a pool of data center resources are some of the key benefits of the cloudbased approach that brings service agility and tremendous capex and opex savings upwards of  percent to service providers for vnfs to provide these benefits it has to be built for the cloud environment with open application program interfaces apis and modular approach hence the term “cloudnative” a growing number of organizations such as cloud native computing foundation cncf and service providers including att vodafone deutsche telecom and tele are supporting the cloudnative implementations  genband has fully embraced a cloudnative nfv approach for all its vnf implementations such as session border controller ims media resource function intelligent messaging and others microservices architecture have been touted as an advancement in the building of cloud applications what role does the architecture play for nfv and how is genband using this architecture in its products bhatia microservices architecture is fundamental to a cloudnative vnf implementation the concept has been around for a while in enterprise it applications but is new to the telecom industry in a microservices architecture you basically break apart a software application into smaller selfcontained modules that runs as individual virtual instances anywhere in the cloud and interworks with each other and with the rest of the application ecosystem via apis it will fundamentally shift how a telecom software application are built a vnf built with microservices architecture generally constitute of several virtual instances or vms – each playing a dedicated role such as persistent database cache application processing security and many others and capable of scaling independently as needed it brings major improvements in vnfs performance scalability resource efficiency and resiliency – all critical factors to maintain a carrier grade service that nfv infrastructure claims genband is using a microservices approach at multiple levels for instance we have fully distributed the two main functions of sbc – signaling and media into its own respective vnfs a unique solution in the market we also share another key principal of microservices architecture the same media function across multiple signaling applications another unique capability we further apply the microservices architecture within each vnf to achieve horizontal elastic scalability ondemand softwarebased transcoding nm redundancy and independent scalability of functional capabilities such as call processing routing security and device registrations why should service providers have geodistributed virtual network functions and is this difficult to deploy and manage bhatia geodistribution and flexible network deployment topologies of vnfs are critical for nfv cloud deployments to provide the best user experience in terms of reliability reduced latency and superior quality for voice services geodistributing vnfs between the mobile core edge and customer premises enables service providers to provide high reliability and optimized deployments for example distributing media processing to the edge of the networks reduces latency and provides a better enduser experience  furthermore genband enables geodistribution of vnf components within and between data centers which further enhances resilience and redundancy what can we expect from genband at mwc this year bhatia we are excited to showcase our ecosystem nfv solutions to the mobile community attending mwc genband will be showcasing our high performance vnf and vnf management solutions for volte transcoding interconnect and roaming at our booth in hall  booth i we will also be showcasing our predictive analytics vnf solution which was a finalist in last year’s intel and verizon innovation challenge we are going to be showcasing these solutions on our ecosystem partner nfvi environments one of the featured demonstrations includes a multicloud volte solution that will highlight genband’s multiple vnfs simultaneously deployed and elastically scaled with the genband vnf manager on the hpe helion openstack carrier grade environment to instantly turn up services on multiple geodistributed cloud environments this demonstration will also be showcased in the hpe opennfv partner showcase in hall  stand e we
