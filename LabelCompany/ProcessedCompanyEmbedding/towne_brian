host and producer brian reed on finding the podcast’s story and how the town reacted to the spotlight by mike pesca   brian reed andrea morales on the gist mike pesca talks with brian reed host and producer of the hit podcast stown if you haven’t listened to stown yet a warning spoilers abound this interview has been edited and condensed for clarity mike pesca you posted everything on one day why that format advertisement brian reed the basic reason is that i can’t write those shows every week i can never do what sarah koenig does we wanted people to be able to say something make an allegation against something i didn’t want to have to feel compelled to have the other person respond to them immediately i wanted you to know that everybody’s going to have their say in this one package it’s one thing and made it more fun to structure and write that way it lessens the primacy of the cliffhanger as the thing that gets you from episode to episode that was also a reason we talked about explicitly when we talked about releasing it this way it had to do with wanting it to be like a novel versus modeling it after more like a tv series where you do feel more compelled to have a cliffhanger we wanted to be able to end in more ruminative or quiet ways let’s talk timeline a voicemail from john in —is that the first contact advertisement the first contact actually was late  the general email he wrote to our listener email he was a listener to this american life it’s not even a tip email it was really just like i hate this story i love this story you should do a story about this i brought it to a pitch meeting that we have every week where i was like should i look into this the subject line was “john b mclemore lives in shittown alabama” even in the punctuation i would say had a bit of erraticism what he was saying was that this place is terrible you guys should come down and look at some of the stuff that’s going on here namely this alleged murder that’s taken place mike pesca mike pesca is the host of the slate daily podcast the gist he also contributes reports and commentary to npr was it the craft of the writing he hooked you or was there something about it that made you say oh there really could be a murder it certainly had a kind of liveliness to it but i do think i was like if this is true that’s really fucked up and someone should look into that but then it was a long time before we actually got on the phone it wasn’t a huge priority for me so we went back and forth and we kind of lost touch for about a year out of the woodwork he came back with an actual news story that he linked to about a pretty bad case of sexual abuse and police misconduct that had happened in his county when i saw that i was like maybe i should just get on the phone with this guy advertisement during your exchanges over email did he sparkle he sent me a whole introduction to himself with pictures is he tatted in those pictures not that i could see i think the pictures were probably from before that i thought i was talking to a guy who was going to give me information about a murder then he started telling me about his life even in the next email to me advertisement how long until you pretty much decided that the original reason you were there—to investigate this murder—was nothing it actually took me a little while john had me pretty paranoid in terms of contacting authorities of any kind we were playing things close to the chest and i was interested in him too but i did want to figure out whether this was true or not is there a gap where you and the staff question if you really have a story i came to that conclusion only very shortly before john died i got to the point where i knew it hadn’t happened i called john i had that conversation with him but i still wanted to go back down i was interested in him and tyler and there were other things he had told me about that i was like maybe there’s another piece of corruption or something that’s worth looking into advertisement our last couple conversations among other things were me saying let me finish this thing that’s airing on july  and i’ll be down the next week he was like oh my god i’m going to have to get the housekeeper over here there’s fleas everywhere and it’s going to be so fucking hot it’s such a shit town in the summer jesus christ and then on june  he killed himself the memorial service was the week of this other story but i wanted to go i honestly didn’t know if anyone would be there i thought that maybe just tyler goodson and his family would be there i learned that he actually did have a lot of relations in his life that were far closer than he was with me i was wondering what we would do after it but i wasn’t as involved in my thinking about the story yet at that point the story as we hear it more or less tracks the stories as you come to understand them one of those things was the revelation about mad hatter disease john had left this list behind of friends that he wanted contacted after he died and i started talking to people off that list many of them were clock customers and horologists of different stripes a couple of them started mentioning this firegilding process that involved mercury and mentioning mad hatter disease but it was one thing mentioned in interviews about many other things after a couple of times i googled mad hatter disease and i saw this list of symptoms that seemed to describe john i talked to several experts then in talking with my editor julie snyder we kind of put it to the side because it seemed like speculation then our researcher in the course of factchecking started talking to some mercury experts about what john was doing these experts were all saying that it’s hard to imagine that he wouldn’t be poisoned in some way that was in the last month or less before it came out maybe the last two weeks do you think that’s the probable explanation for some of his behavior for some of it but i definitely think there’s many other things going on in john’s life i think he also had other mental health issues he was on medication prescribed by a doctor earlier in his life he was also just a person who was lonely it’s an alchemy of things that are playing into his personality i think that anyone who writes that you betrayed a trust or violated privacy is actually paying you an unbelievably high compliment almost all of journalism is a betrayal of privacy or some sort of trust there’s something in the criticism where it’s like he didn’t understand exactly what the story would be i have never done a story with anyone who’s living where i can describe to them exactly what the story is going to be at the beginning there’s no point in doing the story you can do that that is the point of doing longform reporting—to come to understand the story and understand more than you know and to make something at the end that you could not have predicted at the beginning to reveal something about characters that the characters didn’t know you’re always weighing the consequences of it they’re everyday things that you deal with when you’re reporting especially about real people there are many things that we left out we were weighing all sorts of information that we got i learned way more than what’s in the story and you make those decisions whether someone’s alive or not the premise of that question points at a different understanding of journalism than i have basically do you think there’s gold there i cannot speak any more on that than i’ve said in the podcast do you want there to be gold there no i’m above that argument i like tyler and i like rita a lot i disagree with things that both of them are doing i certainly was sympathizing with tyler at the beginning when john died and he was telling me this bad stuff was happening but as i got to know rita i also totally saw from her side and i hope that that comes through in the story as well i like her she’s funny and i could totally see where she was coming from in a lot of respects you make the case that perhaps in some ways that his mom is better off with rita i don’t know for sure because i really didn’t get deep into his relationship with his mother when he was living i visited with his mom since he died saw where she was living told her about the story and did an interview with her that i didn’t ultimately use she seemed good and to be grieving everyone has told me she had john’s wit before the dementia got worse and she still is very funny and biting even with signs of dementia can you update us on how any of the characters in your story reacted to the podcast tyler and his family all listened in the first day i’ve been chatting with tyler’s mom who said she loved it thought it was very honest tyler said he really appreciated it it seems to have also been very emotional for him we’ve stayed in touch and i think he’s having ups and downs—i can’t imagine being that close to someone and then hearing his voice in that way and hearing him presented in a story this way i’m sure it’s both gratifying and upsetting and that’s the sense i get of what he’s going through any other of the minor characters weigh in when they saw the name shittown and that it may be involved in murder people were saying they wished they hadn’t taken part i wrote them immediately and said you guys should really listen i think you have the wrong idea about what this is i sent them a couple reviews of it but as soon as they listened they’re like i totally loved it and i really think you got the town very well a lot of people said that a lot of alabamans on reddit one of the more interesting conversations i had was with the guy bubba who is in chapter  in the tattoo parlor scene said some very obscene racist comments i’d let him know about the podcast but i hadn’t heard back i hadn’t seen him since that night in  a few days after it came out i had a facebook message from him saying “call me” i gave him a call he said he’d listened to it twice loved the story and thought it got john really well i think he was like i didn’t take you seriously i didn’t know you were going to this he said my old lady’s a little upset because people online are calling me a racist and a white supremacist but you know what i said those things and that’s part of who i was you got both sides of me he appreciated his portrayal even though he said some pretty terrible things it was a weird experience to talk to him do you expect to ever revisit it in audio form my inclination is no i feel very satisfied with the package of it in my head it doesn’t feel like the kind of thing that keeps going but there are unanswered questions if something were substantial enough i’d be open to it but i don’t it to want to just feel like an update i’d want it to be a story load comments powered by livefyre slate sign in sign up slate slate sign in sign up utah fire threatens ski town of brian head  fox news fox news us expandcollapse search fires utah fire threatens ski town of brian head by andrew craft published june   fox news facebook twitter email print   a wildfire is raging in southern utah near the ski town of brian head and has now consumed almost one thousand acres forcing about  people to evacuate the town website posted a warning on its front page “the entire town of brian head is currently being evacuated until further notice due to a wildland fire please avoid coming toward brian head at this time” officials launched an investigation but said they believed the fire was humancaused there are reports of one home destroyed and another home damaged with many more homes threatened by the fire but emergency officials in utah said there have been no reports of anybody hurt  bear kills teen running mountain race the wildfire is burning through the dixie national forest where brian head a popular ski resort destination in the winter and hiking mecca in the summer is located all routes into brian head are closed to nonemergency vehicles there is no immediate concern of the blaze reaching the brian head resort flights have been restricted over the

the ski resort town of brian head she was made to evacuate “the magnitude of the fire was just incredible nothing like i’ve ever seen before” she heard it was started from a brush fire but that has not been confirmed “we just saw some smoke when we were leaving our condo and we noticed it kept growing and growing and growing” utah state forester brian cottam underscored the point of an increase in humancaused fires “for this early in the fire season we have had just a rash of human caused fire starts fires that don’t need to happen we really just ask the public to be careful and cautious and think about what they’re doing” utah emergency management officials said in a press release that the fire slowed its progression over night but that recordchallenging heat will be an obstacle in the
