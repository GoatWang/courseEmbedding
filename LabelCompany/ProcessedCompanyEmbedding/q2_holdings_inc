and thanks for being with us during the call today well talk about the performance of one new gnc during the second quarter and how that shapes our view at the back half of  well walk you through financial results we released earlier this morning and then open the call to your questions before we begin i must as always remind you that everything we cover during todays call including questions and answers is subject to the forwardlooking information statement included in our q let me now turn it over to bob moran our interim ceo robert f moran  gnc holdings inc thanks matt and good morning everyone when we designed the one new gnc we did it with the customer in mind we were making bold changes in investments to leverage the strength and advantages inherent in our model fix what was broken and improve the customer experience during the second quarter we saw those improvements begin to pay off and made good progress towards our goal of delivering meaningful profitable growth it is still early days and we have work to do but it looks like we are headed in the right direction transactions for the quarter were up  building on the growth we saw in the first quarter of  we are attracting new customers to gnc they are shopping more frequently and were converting more of them transactions and comps ramped up throughout the quarter trends that have continued into the early days of q were also encouraged by the performance of our original pilot stores which are outpacing the rest of the chain in both transactions and average ticket growth and comp sales for the pilot stores in the second quarter were positive in many ways this business is bucking the retail trend with transaction growth thats well above the apt retail index yeartodate the challenges in our sector are wellpublicized as our concerns about the future of retail but we believe there is an opportunity for business models like gnc that listen and respond to the customer and give them products and experiences they cant get anywhere else as you know we took decisive action on pricing when we launched the one new gnc eliminating the twotier pricing structure and ending our addiction to excessive promotions in bogos and reducing prices on items tied to price perception while protecting margins on more flexible categories and skus customers reacted positively and quickly and the sales trends were experiencing suggest that they are continuing to respond our revamped loyalty program continues to perform well and are giving us access to new customers improving frequency and creating a foundation for powerful integrated marketing and customer connections mygnc rewards now has approximately  million members and halfway through the year we are at  of our  enrollment goal mygnc is consistent with our one price strategy and because members earn price for every – earned points for every dollar they spend and get cashback rewards the program encourage spending and drives return trips to redeem those rewards after six months we continue to believe mygnc members are on track to visit six times a year compared with gold card members who visited just four times in and entire year pro access our premium loyalty offering has enrolled nearly  members since its launch in march our core and most profitable customer the health enthusiast is responding well to the program which includes offerings tailored to their individual interest purchase habits and needs in the second quarter pro access members visited twice as often purchased two times as many products and spent significantly more enrollment in the pro access program is trending a bit below our expectations and we are now implementing a bonus point offering that gives pro access members instant gratification so far were seeing improvement from this incentive with limited margin impact pro access and mygnc also are growing the ranks of contactable customers today we have three times as many customer email addresses than we had six months ago were gathering data that can help us truly understand our customers and developing the platforms and expertise to tailor our communication regimen recommendations and offers to their specific interests and needs our dotcom business is improving driven by our work to fix the assortment and get pricing right and were pleased with the performance of the gnc store on amazon which features our best products and is consistently priced with gnccom and our retail locations because more than  of online products searches happen on amazon and of those  buy that product in the store we believe amazon is not a death knell for brickandmortars but a great advertising platform that puts us right in the path of countless new customers through amazon and our digital marketing initiatives were working to increase the likelihood that when the consumer surfs social media or search the web for wellness solutions they find gnc pricing loyalty and fixing the dotcom business requires significant investments those investments are starting to deliver returns but we have work to do on the margin front private label is an important opportunity for our business our own brands are aligned with customer needs exclusive to gnc carry higher margins and allow us to use our manufacturing capacity were working now to expand our most successful brands including beyond raw vitapak amp and total lean and while we still have work to do weve increased private label penetration  percentage points since march in addition we just signed a deal to be the exclusive us provider of all performix supplement products performix is one of the industrys leading innovators and gncs largest national brand and this exclusive agreement lets us use performix proprietary technology in our future innovations as part of our partnership performix will work directly with our field operations to implement programs like demos training and inventory management product innovation matters to the consumer but in the wellness category they want and they need trusted advice our ability to provide it can help can support average ticket growth improve margins and ultimately create customer loyalty while basket size has been inching up we like to see a faster pace of growth we are not satisfied with where we are and were testing vehicles that can move the needle faster and so far we are experiencing promising results we just completed train the trainer sessions on customer engagement solution selling and how to move customers from a single product to buying regimens this training will hit the stores by the end of july we continue to roll out new regimens addons and grabandgoes and have focused the stores on the simple idea of adding one more item to the customer basket which would yield meaningful revenue and margin growth we designed and invested in the one new gnc to bring customers back to our model return this business to positive comps and ultimately to deliver profitable growth and regain our position as a market leader in the second quarter of  we made good progress towards those goals before handing over to tricia i want to let you know that the search for a permanent ceo is ongoing in the meantime ive signed up for another six months in the interim role as we look to the back half of the year we believe well continue to build on the momentum we created in the first two quarters well accelerate the initiatives that are delivering growth and generating loyalty and focus intently on margin improvement with that ill have tricia walk you through our second quarter numbers tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc good morning everyone as bob mentioned we saw continued strength in transactions throughout the second quarter so far we are pleased with the investment weve made in price and loyalty and focused on delivering growth excluding longlived asset impairment charges our second quarter adjusted eps was  compared to  in the prior year period which excludes gains on refranchising consolidated revenue was down  to  million in the second quarter in our us and canada segment revenue was down  largely driven by a  million decrease due to the discontinuation of the gold card program our international segment delivered  revenue growth manufacturingwholesale revenue excluding intersegment sales decreased  second quarter same store sales including gnccom decreased  in domestic companyowned stores which is a  basis point improvement from the first quarter even though we are not pleased with negative comps we are heading in the right direction and this is the best comp we have achieved in six quarters the second quarter experienced the biggest declines in protein vitamins weight management and food and drink categories those declines were partially offset by strong performance from performance supplements health and beauty and the herbs and greens categories gnccom comp decreased  in the second quarter which is incrementally better than q we expect gnccom to achieve positive comp in the back half of the year as we lap price and bulk buying changes made in the prior year in domestic franchise locations revenue increased nearly  million during the quarter due to the impact of a higher average store base partially offset by a  decline in retail same store sales our international business grew during the second quarter with the  increase in revenue and a  increase in operating income driven by growth in our china ecommerce business we do see a longterm opportunity in further penetrating the china market and are currently contemplating path to accelerating our growth in that region manufacturing and wholesale revenues excluding intersegment sales declined  for the quarter thirdparty contract manufacturing was down  in the second quarter due to timing of shipments and rationalization of skus sales to wholesale partners decreased  and intersegment sales declined  primarily due to lower gnc branded products sales in the us and canada despite this decline in revenue operating income is up  basis points as a percent of sales versus last year second quarter gross profit as a percent of sales was  compared with  in the prior year the decrease was primarily due to the impact of pricing and loyalty associated with the one new gnc which reduced the retail margin rate loyalty costs include the impact of the discontinuation of a gold card member pricing program in the us partially offset by higher vendor funding additionally there was a  basis point positive impact to gross profit rate due to onetime vendor funding we continue to expect gross profit to range from  to  for the remainder of this year sga in the second quarter was  of sales this is above last year due to incremental investments in online marketing and the reduction to an incentive accrual in  we expect sga as a percentage of sales to be in line with quarters one and two during the back half of the year in the second quarter we generated  million in net cash from operating activities invested  million in capital expenditures and generated  million in free cash flow were still planning fewer new store openings and less spending on it in  and expect capex to be in line with last quarters estimate of  million to  million we continue to expect free cash flow to be in excess of  million for the year a third of this free cash flow is driven by operating results while the rest of the products and working capital changes primarily related to inventory and accounts payable as we discussed last quarter we plan to use cash that previously would have been allocated to our dividends or in prior quarters to share repurchases to lower our debt levels focusing first on paying down our revolver in particular we expect to have the revolver paid down by the end of  we are moving toward a longterm adjusted leverage ratio of approximately  times with rent capitalized at  times and well take a disciplined approach to inventory management and capital expenditures working capital initiatives should drive incremental nearterm debt reduction opportunity we continue to reevaluate our real estate portfolio and make changes we feel are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders we expect corporate store closings for the year to range from  to  driven by our purposeful strategy of opportunistically closing stores which will be accretive to cash flow while we feel good about the progress weve made in the last two quarters wed like to gather more data and understand the trends but for now were holding off on giving detailed guidance we can tell you that we continue to expect comps to turn positive in the back half along with quarteronquarter margin dollar benefit with that lets open the call for your questions operator could you please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator well take our first question from peter benedict with robert baird peter s benedict  robert w baird  co inc hi guys a couple questions just around the strategies to build basket bob i think you mentioned some stuff train the trainer can you give us a sense of how – maybe what youre doing there and anything else thats different from how the store personnel were kind of trained in the past robert f moran  gnc holdings inc peter you really have to think about how we were managing the customer experience before we were selling the gold card mainly and thats where our conversations were centered around to really shift the culture to being trusted advisers it takes some time its a cultural change in the pilot we saw that it took about six months or so to really go deep with that and obviously were putting tools all around that from marketing to regimen selling to solution selling to adding one item in the basket plus well also give it system support by the end of the year we have a management learning system that will be coming in in the back half of the year that will be directly on the tablets to help the associates understand how they can help the customer add one more item to the basket peter s benedict  robert w baird  co inc okay thats helpful and tricia i know youre not going for guidance officially but you did mention some bands for gross margin the back half of the year of   i think in the past youve spoken sga around   of sales as we think about just those as kind of benchmarks i mean are those fair for where you see this business kind of settling in longer term or what else do you need to see from the business in order to kind of embrace maybe that as a longerterm structural margin profile for the business thanks tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc sure peter so in first and second quarter we were between  and  of sga as a percent of sales and we believe that thats the level that we should experience at least in  the increase in that spend is largely due to investments in online marketing that weve talked about in the past and were seeing positive results and well continue and invest in that as long as we do but if something changes than what were experiencing we might adjust but certainly in the near term a  to  range is appropriate peter s benedict  robert w baird  co inc okay great thanks guys tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc thank you operator well take our next question from shane higgins with deutsche bank shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc yes good morning thanks for taking the questions on the last quarter call you gave some really good detail on the comps by pilot the september pilot stores and the october pilot stores both on comps and transaction growth could you just give us some color on how those are trending or how they trended in the second quarter tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc yes so our pilot stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain by several percentage points and there as we mentioned on the call there were positive comps in the second quarter so the trends are continuing sequentially monthtomonth and the pilot locations are still performing strong and are giving us the confidence that comps in the back half of the year should be positive as they are trending in the low singledigit positive comp area shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks and then just on your free cash flow outlook just looked at your inventory was down slightly about in line with your sales could you just help us understand kind of i mean your guidance implies about  million of free cash flow in the back half can you just help us understand where the inventory opportunity is is it on the retail side is it in the manufacturing side just so we can get some comfort around that because it seems pretty aggressive tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc yeah thanks shane sure the majority of the reduction is certainly on the retail side and there are a number of initiatives that are taking place the most significant was what i would call segmentation and so as you might recall we put a lot of inventory in the stores back in  and  and it tends to drive additional sales but what were finding was we werent refined enough in our inventory allocation strategy to provide the proper return so segmentation meaning look at stores from both the volume and demographic perspective to have the right inventory there and then remove that inventory and reallocate it to stores where it will be productive so segmentation would be the biggest component and those processes are underway right now as you noted we were able to reduce inventories in the second quarter and based on our plan we feel confident in our ability to continue to see reductions without a negative impact to the customer experience in addition to that we believe there our core efficiencies that can be generated through replenishment activities and reducing weeks of supply in both our distribution centers and our stores and that should also help to the inventory reduction efforts between now and the end of december shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc okay and i mean in the context of the gross margin guidance that you gave i mean that doesnt seem to imply that youre going to take any significant markdowns so this will be more or less selling kind of in line with the margin that youve been generating tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc and that is our expectation yes shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks i will get back in the queue operator well take our next question from simeon gutman with morgan stanley and im sorry were taking our next question from christopher horvers with jpmorgan christopher horvers  jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning everybody so i wanted to – a couple questions on the topline so youre talking about trends improving throughout the quarter you did have slightly negative comps so have we already inflected to the positive in the month of july tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc no we havent shared exactly where the comp is in the month of july but we do feel confident in our ability to achieve positive comp in the back half of the year christopher horvers  jpmorgan securities llc okay i mean you sort of exited – entered at minus  and ended at minus  so certainly weve seen that way in the pilot stores you talked about some challenges driving baskets where you thought it would be at this point so is it positive comp in pilot stores is it basket size thats driven that is it sort of the traffic acceleration is it units in the basket whats driving underneath that tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc so in the pilot locations we are seeing transactions outpace what were seeing in the rest of the chain largely because the stores and sales and our customers have the opportunity to be on the program for a longer period of time so return customer visits are increasing which is also what were seeing in our rest of chain locations but at the same time there are also improvements in basket so there is less of a delta between prior year and current year from a basket size perspective in the pilot locations and ill go back to what bob was talking about earlier the pilot locations when we launched the program they were able to focus on basket because they already understood how the program worked and so we believe that the training that weve rolled out after our global conference at the end of june which was very similar to the training of the pilot stores we see should be very helpful in helping our associates improve that basket size as we move through the rest of the year christopher horvers  jpmorgan securities llc understood and then youve – two quick followups number one you ran allstore bogo i think it was this week so is that a change i know youre trying to step away from that and then on the vendor funding the  basis point onetime benefit to gross margin is that simply a timing shift you thought it would be spread throughout the year or is it truly onetime in nature or you would have to give that back in q  tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc sure so the first part of your question was around allstore bogos we have not held any allstore bogos at gnc this year nor do we intend to do so we do have a bogo offering in our stores right now in a limited numbers we used a couple of hundreds if i recall correctly and we do feel there is a time and place for bogos just certainly not at the level that we experienced in prior years so our level of items on bogo are down  or more and we dont anticipate having any additional allstore bogos your second question was around vendor funding and yes we did have about a  basis point impact – positive impact to margin in the quarter related to vendor funding that was largely onetime in nature and its not anticipated that that would repeat itself in the back half the year christopher horvers  jpmorgan securities llc so that we have to take that out of q  then tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc yes it would be our expectation that we will continue to work with our vendors to partner on funding the journey but the funding that we received in the second quarter was certainly onetime in nature christopher horvers  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks very much operator and well take our next question from simeon gutman with morgan stanley joshua m siber  morgan stanley  co llc good morning its joshua siber on for simeon can you hear me okay tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc i can joshua m siber  morgan stanley  co llc okay good two balance sheet questions can you clarify that you expect the revolver to be paid down by  tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc we do expect that the revolver will be paid down in total by december of  joshua m siber  morgan stanley  co llc okay can you talk about the options youre looking at with respect to the senior credit facility due in  months tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc were certainly exploring a number of options but dont want to get into all the details at this time but could be a number alternatives through term loan b or other highyield funds but were evaluating what would be the best approach for the company as we move forward joshua m siber  morgan stanley  co llc okay and the  to  store closures can you break that down by international versus company owned in the us and what the plans are for refranchising stores tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc so the  to  relates to corporateowned locations in north america so those do not include any international locations and your second question was around the – i dont recall topic joshua m siber  morgan stanley  co llc refranchising what your efforts are there tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc okay so our refranchising initiative is certainly something thats underway we did not have any significant refranchising efforts in the current quarter our main focus with refranchising is ensuring thats going to drive shareholder value and our main focus for the business is change in the trajectory and implementing one new gnc and being successful as we move forward joshua m siber  morgan stanley  co llc so is the  to  is that – as you look out over the next few years are you meaningfully reducing your footprint because that would imply youre up – already youre down  for the first half which imply a pretty big store closure program in the second half so what does that look like over the next year or two tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc we are actually down more than  in the first half of the year we closed  stores in the first half of the year so were close to halfway along that trajectory but we dont – were not suggesting its going to be a meaningful change in store footprint we are just being very opportunistic in evaluating our leases as they come up for renewals and evaluating our ability to transfer sales to neighboring stores joshua m siber  morgan stanley  co llc okay so thats just  store closures its not net store closures tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc no its  store closures for us for the year not for the back half joshua m siber  morgan stanley  co llc got it thank you operator well take our next question from sean kras with barclays sean stephen kras  barclays capital inc hey good morning and thank you for taking my questions the gnccom comp contribution to comps was about the same as the prior quarter i thought this might actually ramp up a bit given the amazon storefront so im wondering is the flat comp contribution because you reduced your investment in online marketing in the quarter or just you just had a really strong start in the first quarter tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc so there wasnt a significant change in our investment in online marketing what i would attribute the consistency between first and second quarter is largely lapping the changes in our strategy so you might recall in the back half of last year we aligned our pricing between gnccom and the brickandmortar locations and that really eliminated a lot of the bulk sales that we had and as well as some other activities that werent generating the right behaviors for the business from the long term we also did change our platform in the second quarter so complete system change and redesign and that had a bit of a negative impact on our comps but we anticipate that to rebound in third and fourth quarter as we move forward sean stephen kras  barclays capital inc okay and then can you speak to your crm efforts sort of where you are today and where youd like to be lets say a year from now it seems like a pretty big opportunity now that you have i think bob said  million customers signed up for the new program tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc you are right we do have  million customers and i would say were in the early stages from a crm perspective while were leveraging the database through faster engagement with a series of automated messages to engage our shoppers in the program realtime were also using the new members to drive traffic and sales with more regular information about price points and promotions and were reaching more customers with wellness education and new product introductions with more targeted communication based on their buying habits but i would certainly say that were in the early stages of development from a crm perspective and well continue to leverage that significant number of members in a positive way going forward sean stephen kras  barclays capital inc okay and then maybe just one more for me you mentioned strength in the herbs and greens category which is i cant recall hearing anything on that in the recent past at least can you maybe give some more detail on whats driving that strength thanks tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc so in herbs and greens weve changed the promotional cadence a bit and that has had a positive impact on the customers and were also through educating our consumers on the benefits of herbs and greens seeing some positive transactions and there are also some current trends around different items in the herbs and green category that are driving results there sean stephen kras  barclays capital inc thank you operator well take our next question from stephen tanal with goldman sachs stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions i just wanted to follow up on some of the payables it looked a lot lower this quarter certainly than we modeled first part of that question is does that relate in any way to the higher vendor funding called out and then secondly just as you think about the free cash flow guidance i think you called out payables specifically is the plan for that to kind of spike up in the back half or get bigger tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc so your question about vendor funding and does that impact payables there is some impact on payables related to vendor funding as we issue credit back to the vendors and yes in the back half we anticipate payables to increase certainly as we rightsize our inventory there have been impacts to receipts and which has an impact on payables but we anticipate that that will change as we move into the back half of the year stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co llc got it and one question is here on the store counts it looked like  franchise stores were converted to companyowned could you give a little bit of clarity around that or some color there is that a new part of the strategy or is that more of a oneoff opportunistic how did that play out tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc i would say its more a oneoff opportunistic in certain cases there were financial impacts where we decided to take the locations back but were also being more focused on compliance and having the right franchisees operate our locations and where were not in compliance well take the appropriate action and make sure we get that in the right place for the company and for the customer stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co llc understood thats helpful and just lastly if you could help us just sort of think about occupancy and fixed cost deleverage is that getting better and are you maybe having some success negotiating rents with landlords as you take a harder look at real estate or was that pretty consistent how would you frame that tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc so we are seeing positive experience in discussions with our landlords the real estate team is doing a good job there and i would say it will take a little bit of time to see the leverage in occupancy likely into  as were investing this year in changes to the program its just going to take a little bit of time once we get to a positive comp around  to  we see some leverage and we would anticipate that being more impactful in future years than in  stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co llc okay thank you operator well take our next question from bob summers with macquarie capital bob summers  macquarie capital usa inc hey good morning so i guess just a little bit off of that as you look to continue to rationalize the unit base could you just give us a feel for what the lease expiration cycle looks like over the next  to  months in terms of number tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc our average lease term is less than  years so there is   stores each year that come up for renewal and some are closely monitoring those i wouldnt say there is a significant rationalization in the unit base which has been opportunistic and making sure that we drive value and again make the right decision for the customer bob summers  macquarie capital usa inc okay and then the franchisees also had a strong improvement in same store sales or less negative could you just give us a feel for where they are from a sentiment perspective and maybe how theyre thinking about the relationship that you have with amazon right now robert f moran  gnc holdings inc actually its a very positive participation in the one new gnc and actually they participated in the amazon storefront as getting a piece of the action so they have been enjoying comp transaction increases and they have been experiencing the same type of benefits of our corporate stores so the relationship is good its improving we are listening better as we work together and i think we have a lot more positive news in the future about that tricia k tolivar  gnc holdings inc and then regarding amazon so franchisees should – franchisees actually participate in the revenue sharing arrangement and that includes sales on amazon so there hasnt been a significant amount of negative pushback there and keep in mind that the majority of the sales on amazon are with new customers which is great for the business because they tend to start online and then transfer to the stores bob summers  macquarie capital usa inc great thank you operator and this concludes todays questionandanswer session at this time i will turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks robert f moran  gnc holdings inc i just want to thank you for your participation today and we really are looking forward to talking with you in three months about our q results so thank you operator and this concludes todays call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect copyright policy all transcripts on this site
