what you get log in home log in faqs news privacy terms contact us in the news government auctions grow up in the mood for a bargain check out the action on auction sites specializing in government surplus property there are things here youll never see on ebay by karen schwartz december   in the market for a nearly new power boat how about  acres in new mexico or a rolex wristwatch or perhaps youre interested in  cartons of chinese medicinal sliced orchid stems or a slightly used strip club in baltimore all of these items and thousands more are available for purchase at a growing number of webbased auction sites specializing in government surplus seized abandoned and forfeited products and property government auctions of the going going gone variety have been around for years and many still flourish but the growing use of the internet as an auction medium combined with general dissatisfaction at the travel expense and effort involved in staging and attending landbased auctions has led to the growth of the government webauction model government agencies of all types from the us treasury and us marshals service to individual counties have come to rely on private government auction sites as an efficient way to dispose of billions of dollars of equipment and property quickly with higher returns than they could realize by selling on their own numerous entrepreneurs are happy to oblige while grabbing a piece of the lucrative businessa business that yields returns  to  higher than traditional auction methods according to bill angrick ceo of government liquidation llc a subsidiary of liquidity services inc and buyers both individual buyers and small businesses see internetbased government auctions as a great way to get bargainbasement prices on a variety of new and used items not only is there a steady stream of products to sell via internet auction but entrepreneurs need very little in the way of startup costs and expertise anyone with common sense and some form of capitalization can get into this says louis columbus a senior analyst at amr research inc to succeed when competing against dozens or hundreds of similar sites however expertise in dealing with the government as well as stateoftheart technology and a unique business model play key roles some say few webbased government auction houses run barebones operations similar to ebay that simply bring buyers and sellers together those that succeed must have a more robust model of some sort something that appeals to both buyer and seller govliquidationcom for example handles the entire asset sale process for its government customerseverything from warehousing and logistics customer service and buyer transportation to funds collection documentation handling and enforcing unique terms and conditions because of its hightouch business model the site charges a to commission using a consignment model depending on services rendered angrick considers his site to be a success noting that auctions have seen as many as  bids from  individual bidders in a hour period bidassets inc a silver spring md governmentauction house uses the ebay model never taking ownership of property customers visit bidassetscom to gather information about products and properties but unlike ebay the site works like a live auctioneer the hammer doesnt come down until the bidding stops says ceo richard hayman bidassets also provides some valueadded services such as product promotion and customer service for both buyers and sellers and works on commission governmentauctionsorg a subsidiary of cyweb holdings inc employs yet another business model the site acts as a clearinghouse for local state and federal auctions customers pay  per year to access the listings which currently consist of about  live and online government auctions once they find items they want they visit the individual auction sites to carry out the bid process explains president ian aronovich another differentiating factor for these sites is the technology which while it may seem simple can be quite sophisticated governmentauctionsorg for example developed a homegrown system based on active server pages a microsoft sql  database some javascript and verisign incs ssl encryption the site is managed partly by an outside source and partly internally govliquidationcom also developed its platform inhouse at a cost of  million to ensure complete control the site consists of several applications used to receive manage sell track and audit its clients inventory and users while stressing security the system mines about  million records daily angrick says caveat emptor russ fritz a smallbusiness man in jacksonville fla has had good luck buying from government auction sites fritz president of omega enterprises a vehicle remarketer procures many of his vehicles from sites like these you can get some great deals if you know what youre doing he says i bought a lot of  ammunition cans for  cents per can and sold them for  per can so for a  investment plus time and shipping i made  he was able to salvage another recent purchase a truck with a blown motor he bought for  by installing another engine it ran fine and i got a deal he says surplus finds heres a list of some governmentsurplus auction sites ·  govliquidationcom ·  governmentauctionsorg ·  esurpluscom ·  policeauctionscom fritz is siteagnostic preferring instead to follow the deals in addition to visiting governmentauctionsorg he has purchased equipment from sites like esurpluscom and policeauctionscom handled by vortal group inc although government auction sites can yield good deals it helps to have had experience in the auction world says mike bagherian president of tazz construction inc a small business in rockville md you have to be somewhat of a gambler and you have to be liquid he says there are times when i sweat it a little but bagherian says nerves of steel can pay off not only has he bought tools for his business at  less than he would have paid at a local hardware store but he has even ventured out to buy items for himself he procured his latest purchase a latemodel mercedes with about  miles for about  less than he would have paid at a dealership there are even times he says when the unexpected can occur a recent purchase of  acres in mexico yielded a call from behemoth conoco oil requesting permission to drill for oil on the property the company offered bagherian a paltry  a price he turned down at least for now in many cases experience with the auction process can really pay off bagherian recently was tempted to buy a property in jackson city miss with a new warehouse for less than a great deal on the surface but i started calling around and i found unpaid back taxes and toxic soil in the area i also found that four other people had looked at the property and rejected it he says in the end bagherian took a pass but checked back with the site and learned that someone had purchased it soon afterward
