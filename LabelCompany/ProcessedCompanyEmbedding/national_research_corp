research development corporation v commissioner of patents   clr  has been important in clarifying what is meant by manner of manufacture in respects of patent applications the references to the patents act in this case refer to the australian patents act  cth which was later repealed by the introduction of the patents act  contents  facts  issues  legal issues considered  decision  references factsedit the national research development corporation nrdc discovered a new method to apply known chemicals to the soil so as to kill weeds but not the crops the chemicals were known to science but were never used in the process of eradicating weeds nrdc applied for a patent for the new process the commissioner of patents rejected the application on the grounds that it was not a manner of manufacture under section  of the statute of monopolies because the invention was neither a new saleable product nor a new process for producing a saleable product the invention involved an agricultural process which could not be a manner of manufacture the invention was merely a new use for an existing product nrdc appealed under s  to the court as the appeal tribunal for the purposes of the act the case was argued before a full court the complete specification in the present case contains six claims those numbered   and  are for selective herbicidal compositions and are not here in question claims   and  are in these terms a method for eradicating weeds from crop areas containing a growing crop selected from leguminous fodder crops of the genera trifolium and medicago celery and parsnip a method for the control of weeds of the type of charlock creeping thistle and annual nettle in a lucerne alfalfa crop a method for the control of weeds of the type of charlock creeping thistle and annual nettle in a clover crop the commissioner did not consider the new process a manner of manufacture and argued that the definition of invention is restricted to vendible products and processes for their production and excludes all agricultural and horticultural processes the appellant nrdc argued that the new process can be considered a manner of manufacture subject to the definition in the patents act  and grant of privilege under s  of the statute of monopolies if a process produces either immediately or ultimately an economically useful result issuesedit the issue for the court was to determine if this new process of weed – killing constituted a manner of manufacture and could therefore be considered a patentable invention the court had to consider whether it is enough that a process produces a useful result or whether it is necessary that some physical thing is either brought into existence or so affected as the better to serve mans purposes legal issues considerededit nrdc brought the appeal under s patents act  which sets out the ground for acceptance of a patent request definition of manner of manufacture contained within section  of the statute of monopolies section  patents act  definition of patent as a letters patent for an invention this definition is now enclosed in section  patents act  the deputy commissioner and on the authority of re application by standard oil development co   rpc  decided in respect of each of the three claims that the method claimed was not a manner of manufacture his reason being that it did not result in any vendible product of patents v microcell ltd the commissioner alleged that nrdcs new process was merely a new use for an existing product pursuant to the precedent set in this case gecs application   rpc  a test for assessing whether a method or process is a manner of manufacture was formulated in this case it was held that a method or process is a manner of manufacture if it a results in the production of some vendible product or b improves or restores to its former condition a vendible product or c has the effect of preserving from deterioration some vendible product to which it is applied the outcome of the nrdc case reduced these rules to guidelines and the notion of vendible and product should be given a broad interpretation pursuant to the broad interpretation of manner of manufacture in section  of the statute of monopolies decisionedit i processes may be patented provided that it produces a material advantage and has a new and useful effect that produces a physical product ii nrdcs new process made use of existing chemicals that had never been used in eradicating weeds a new use of a known substance is patentable provided the use takes advantage of a previously unknown property that is it must be used in a way that it has never been used or thought to use previously therefore in this case it is the process not the article that constitutes the invention iii the outcome of this new process was only arrived at by scientific ingenuity and research and is considered a vendible product because it created an artificial state of affairs in respect of weeds and crops and achieved an economically useful result iv agricultural and horticultural processes are not outside the limits of patentable inventions provided they are not excluded by any other of the

only contrariansummaryfounder and ceo controls the company through b sharesthis allows a longerterm orientation and aligned shareholder goalscapital allocation ratios indicate an excellent businessdiscrepancies in the price of the different share classesi stumbled upon national research corporation nrcia nrcib running a stock screener for small and midcaps that earn high returns on invested capital and was instantly intrigued the company is controlled by its founder and current ceo michael d hays who signs the annual letter fellow owner while allotting so much power in the hands of one individual can entail risk it also can mean better alignment between the company and its shareholders the owneroperator issue taken from the annual report we can see the ownership structure of the company below hays owns over half the b class shares which are entitled to one vote per share and over a quarter of the lesser a shares which are entitled to only oneonehundredth th of one vote per share the b shares constitute  of the total voting power related to the company the company also has a staggered board another potential defense mechanism if takeover attempts were ever an issue the company does note in the annual report that five out of the six board members are independent there is no official chairman role however because the board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate at this time since it establishes the company’s chief executive officer as the primary executive leader with one vision and eliminates ambiguity as to who has primary responsibility for the company’s performance it has designated a lead director instead but for all intents and purposes an investment in nrc health inherently involves putting a lot of trust in ceo hays who as an owneroperator has most of the control over not only voting concerns but also the strategic vision and direction of the overall company it should also be noted that his overall salary for fiscal  was far from excessive at  with  of it being his base salary hays appears to be a capable capital allocator the current founder and ceo of nrc health seems to being doing a great job judging by the companys capital allocation metrics i created the below chart in excel to examine the companys return on invested capital nrc health has a notable track record of achieving aboveaverage returns on invested capital over the past decade and fiscal  wasnt any different the company has hardly any offbalance sheet operating leases and hardly any debt in its overall capital structure adding to its strong balance sheet the company has also consistently turned  to  or more according to data from morningstar of revenues into free cash flow each year as well free cash flow has exceeded net income each of the last ten years too so it could be argued that sustainable high quality earnings are another positive that can be added to the list the equity slice and the effects of different share classes next id like to take a look at return on equity i broke nrc healths roe down into five different pieces to see whats been driving it over the last few years we can see operating margins bounced back in  and management has boosted efficiency as well at least judging by the increase in asset turnover higher margins and better asset turn have allowed higher roe in  despite less magnification from leverage than in  and only a moderate increase in  from  this is an area that could likely be improved in a few ways  tax reform nrc healths roe would be boosted if taxes in the us were lowered judging by its relatively high tax rate  more leverage a higher leverage ratio could boost roe its hard to find fault with managements capital allocation track record however at least in my opinion the dual share class is one area of concern to consider though the a shares are highly liquid but the b shares are the opposite there has also been dramatic performance discrepancies between the two as well nrcia data by ycharts dividends are also dramatically different between the two share classes as well as valuations the b shares trade at  times  earnings and yield  but arent very liquid the liquid lesservotingpower a shares trade at  times  diluted earnings and yield only  conclusion there seems to be a big disconnect in the different share classes and unless i buy the lessliquid b shares it appears i have no shareholder rights and am just along for the ride the a shares are largely owned by mr hays trust as well im still trying to figure out managements motives for the recap that created the separate share classes as well as why theres such a wide discount while im a fan of the business as a whole im not so sure i like the dual share classes as of now im leaning more towards the b shares if at all if anyone has more added insight into the dual share class andor benefits of both please share in the comment section below if you enjoyed this article and would

many new owners go by corporation plan to raise money from outside investorsthe stricter formalities give investors the knowledge they desire about how your company is runplan to go public in the

once documents are ready well ship your final package for arrival on the second business day day trial of attorney advice speak with an independent attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
