period a despite increasing signs that economic recovery was taking hold the federal reserve board the fed maintained an accommodative monetary policy for much of the reporting period it was not until after a particularly strong employment report in march that the fed changed course and began to lay the groundwork for higher rates the first rate increase in four years finally came on june   when the fed moved the federal funds rate from  to  as part of its announcement the fed also indicated that it would consider larger and more frequent rate hikes if needed to ward off inflation q how did the corporate and mortgagebacked sectors perform over the period a throughout the reporting period positive economic news was offset by higher oil prices inflation fears and rising interest rates the net result was little movement in the corporate bond market over the sixmonth reporting period conversely the rise in interest rates negatively affected the mortgagebacked bond market causing it to underperform similar duration treasury bonds mortgagebacked securities mbs have prepayment risk which means that as sidenote sma relationship trust series t investment goal maximum total return

pncsrsth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th interest rates rise the incentive for homeowners to call their bonds that is refinance decreases and the effective duration of any outstanding mbs increases as a function of the rise in interest rates this duration extension makes mortgageoriented portfolios more sensitive to rising interest rates q how did you manage the trust in this environment a within the corporate marketplace our research suggested that the market was factoring in a very optimistic scenario which we felt was unlikely to unfold as a result we entered the reporting period with a relatively neutral market weighting and a slightly lower duration than the indexes a positioning that was intended to protect the portfolio from market volatility and to allow us to take advantage of periods of market weakness this strategy helped performance when corporate bonds underperformed other spread sectors and when longer dated corporate bonds underperformed shorter dated ones within the mortgagebacked portion of the trust we favored higher coupon securities as a result the trust was able to generate incremental income and at the same time maintain a shorter duration versus the indexes ultimately enhancing relative performance performance was also aided by strong individual issue selection within the mortgage market q how do you anticipate structuring the trusts portfolio going forward a we will continue to focus the mortgage portion of the trust on shorter duration less prepaymentsensitive issues these will generally be higher coupon bonds or securities with specific structural features that limit prepayment variability on the corporate side we also have less duration than the benchmark as the extra yield available over treasuries that longdated corporate bonds can presently offer is not much higher than what we can earn on shortdated for example fiveyear issues  pncsrsth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th we thank you for

indicated that it would consider larger and more frequent rate hikes if needed to ward off inflation q how did you manage the trust over the period a given the overall economic expansion and our belief that interest rates would be rising we continued to maintain a shorter duration than the benchmark throughout the reporting period this was detrimental to results in the first quarter of  as yields declined due to less than expected new job growth however our increased exposure to the  to year portion of the yield curve which outperformed shorter duration securities was beneficial to

monthly  pncsrsth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th sults given the rising interest rate environment from a yield curve perspective our underweight position in one to fiveyear maturities was helpful as this was the poorest performing area our position in the  to year range of the curve helped relative performance as well as this was the best performing area of the curve as the reporting period progressed we adjusted our strategy related to general obligation bonds we had previously underweighted this sector as the fortunes of these bonds are tied to tax revenues however given the strengthening economy many states reduced their budget deficits through largerthanexpected tax revenues we believe this trend is likely to continue going forward as such we selectively added a number of general obligation securities to the portfolios including those of california and new york city we also took the opportunity to purchase several california taxexempt bonds the state issued a record  billion in municipal securities over the period to help shore up its budget deficit this huge influx of supply put an enormous strain on the market and caused the california exempt market in particular to underperform we viewed this as an opportunity given the potential for the states economy to improve in the coming years and purchased these bonds on weakness we have also seen a number of positive trends in the airport sector the airline industry itself remains weak yet the need for airfreight and transportation continues to rise in addition startup and budget airlines continue to gain market share from the major airline carriers many of which are in precarious financial straits overall this is beneficial as the airport sector itself is not as tied to the fortunes of any particular carrier additionally while we remain negative on the overall healthcare sector as a result of declining government reimbursements we identified several turnaround situations that we believe are attractive q how do you anticipate structuring the trusts portfolio going forward a looking ahead we will retain our short duration as we believe the federal reserve boards basis point shortterm rates increase at the end of june could be the beginning of a series of rate hikes in fact after period end the fed announced another  basis point hike at its august meeting having said that we do not believe inflation is out of control however slightly higher rates would be consistent with the feds policy of acting preemptively to avoid a dramatic increase in either interest rates or inflation in the future we anticipate maintaining our strategy of overweighting california taxexempt bonds given their attractiveness we will also continue to look for opportunities in the california and new york city general obligation bond sectors as always we remain diligent in our quest to identify securities that offer meaningful upside potential with limited risk
