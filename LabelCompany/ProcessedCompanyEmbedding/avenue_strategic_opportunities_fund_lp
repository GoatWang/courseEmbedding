of june   month in review june was a tale of two halves early in the month european central bank ecb president mario draghi led the eurozone towards continued excessive accommodation which caused rates to move much lower across europe however coordinated hawkish central bank messaging at the end of the month reversed the relentless flattening of the yield curve while the testimony of former fbi director james comey was a nonevent as far as financial markets were concerned the fed raised the fed funds rate for the second time this year in midmonth while laying out a plan to reduce its massive  trillion balance sheet which should start in the near term as of now it appears the fed will allow  billion of us treasury exposure to roll off monthly and  billion for agency mortgages with these caps increasing over time to limit market impact while one would expect this to cause interest rates to rise a lack of global inflation has yield curves flattening with rates near their yeartodate lows yet again although this reversed somewhat at the end of the month looking forward commodity prices are again on top of investors’ minds due to the large oil selloff and the implications this has for global investors in addition we may learn of nominations to fill vacant fed seats in addition to janet yellen’s future as her term is set to expire in february  this of course would have implications for global markets looking ahead the first half of the year was fairly quiet from a historical volatility perspective and we do expect more volatility in the back half of  global energy prices impact everything from the health of emerging markets to consumer spending habits so we will be keeping a close eye on commodity prices and the impact for global risk and rate markets most market participants believe it’s a close call whether the fed hikes again in  however our team also believes it will be imperative to watch the impact of the beginning of the wind down of the fed’s balance sheet we are also paying close attention to the ecb as any sign of inflation may cause a change in policy the ecb has remained very accommodative however growth and labor markets are improving in addition a reduction in geopolitical risks may make it more likely that the ecb moves towards a less accommodative policy in the third quarter fees and minimums fees widget loading

returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to

loading  commentary as of june   month in review june was a tale of two halves early in the month european central bank ecb president mario draghi led the eurozone towards continued excessive accommodation which caused rates to move much lower across europe however coordinated hawkish central bank messaging at the end of the month reversed the relentless flattening of the yield curve while the testimony of former fbi director james comey was a nonevent as far as financial markets were concerned the fed raised the fed funds rate for the second time this year in midmonth while laying out a plan to reduce its massive  trillion balance sheet which should start in the near term as of now it appears the fed will allow  billion of us treasury exposure to roll off monthly and  billion for agency mortgages with these caps increasing over time to limit market impact while one would expect this to cause interest rates to rise a lack of global inflation has yield curves flattening with rates near their yeartodate lows yet again although this reversed somewhat at the end of the month looking forward commodity prices are again on top of investors’ minds due to the large oil selloff and the implications this has for global investors in addition we may learn of nominations to fill vacant fed seats in addition to janet yellen’s future as her term is set to expire in february  this of course would have implications for global markets looking ahead the first half of the year was fairly quiet from a historical volatility perspective and we do expect more volatility in the back half of  global energy prices impact everything from the health of emerging markets to consumer spending habits so we will be keeping a close eye on commodity prices and the impact for global risk and rate markets most market participants believe it’s a close call whether the fed hikes again in  however our team also believes it will be imperative to watch the impact of the beginning of the wind down of the fed’s balance sheet we are also paying close attention to the ecb as any sign of inflation may cause a change in policy the ecb has remained very accommodative however growth and labor markets are improving in addition a reduction in geopolitical risks may make it more likely that the ecb moves towards a less accommodative policy in the third quarter fees and minimums fees widget
