article ›× back to cio articlesronald w hovsepian president  ceo intralinks on the company’s new product designed for secure enterprise collaboration intralinks viatm jason redlus  why don’t you tell us a little bit about who you are and your background before you came to intralinks ronald hovsepian  i spent just under  years at ibm in a variety of roles from sales to marketing and development of both hardware and software and finally services i had a wonderful wellrounded experience at ibm from there i went to the venture capital part of the industry which gave me a great appreciation for the creativity and startup mentality that one needs to have in the technology business after that i ran novell a billiondollar enterprise software company which gave me additional experience how did you come to intralinks it’s a small world i happened to have a distant acquaintance with one of the board members and one day that person called me and asked if i’d be interested in the job so i looked at the company and three things really leaped out at me one was the technology platform that the team had built which showed a lot of innovation two i felt the company had an opportunity to address some of the broader customer needs in a very controlled and compliant manner and three i saw that the company had grown very nicely but that growth had slowed and i saw an opportunity for the next level of growth i felt that i had the right skill set to help the company grow to that next level what does intralinks do intralinks is a technology provider of beyondthefirewall collaboration solutions over  of the global fortune  use intralinks to securely share content and collaborate with business partners and customers we got our start  years ago when we created the first virtual data rooms used to support the complex and highly regulated process of managing strategic financial transactions over the years intralinks solutions have been used to support over  trillion in transactions involving over a billion documents in its simplest form our service allows companies to share information in a highly controlled compliant way companies can share information with outside business partners in a controlled manner that allows them to monitor who has seen the information how long they have looked at it and what they did with it the company manages the rights permissions and controls of that information businesses can ultimately use that information in a workflow we do this extremely well what are some examples that illustrate that as i mentioned earlier banks frequently share very sensitive client data and other data for bidding purposes such as hedging or when they’re putting together loan syndications intralinks allows those banks to put all of that data together in a common platform and permit multiple people to access that data from a controlled point of view the life sciences or pharmaceuticals industry is another good example because of the drug trials that a pharma company has to go through in these trials they have to coordinate and manage access for many people in a very controlled manner including the investigator running the clinical trial who needs to upload patient files all of the doctors involved the chemical company that produces the compound various people within their company who designed the drug and the federal regulators all of these people need access to information and the ability to input new information in a very organized documented manner with various levels of control or else the trial has to start all over again that can mean another threeyear delay before the drug is approved so our product is critical for companies who need to share sensitive data beyond the firewall in all industries we’re seeing more and more that information needs to be shared beyond a business’s four walls but while most systems have been designed to protect data from coming in they’re not designed to manage information in that broader manner i noticed that you’ve augmented your portfolio recently with some new acquisitions can you talk a little bit about those recent announcements yes i can advisors and anybody who advises clients on acquisitions are  tasked with helping their clients sell or augment the size of their companies and there are a lot of mediumsized firms around the globe that are looking to grow however those firms don’t always know how to grow for example a toy manufacturer in australia might want to buy a toy manufacturer in latin america to get a footprint in that region but they don’t know how to initiate that relationship to solve these problems we’ve acquired two companies penexus in the us and mergerid in europe and are in the process of combining them to create the largest company for advisors to use as a tool for deal sourcing so whether you’re an advisor for a toy company in australia or a cement company in southeast asia you can go online and use this advisory service to help your clients it will allow transactions to occur faster in the marketplace and allow advisors to more effectively manage their relationships with these acquisitions intralinks now offers a unique endtoend solution for managing the full lifecycle of strategic transactions from deal preparation marketing and sourcing through to due diligence and execution we think that’s critical for success in that marketplace in the long run there has been a lot of buzz around the work you’re doing in your partnerships with cios and cisos can you talk a little bit about what you’re doing there what are the parallels between those two offices and what are some of the unique opportunities presented in working with those leaders we have when i joined intralinks i saw an opportunity to apply our technology and expertise to address a growing problem for enterprise cios and cisos – the need to securely manage their information outsidethefirewall most organizations need to share and collaborate with partners customers and suppliers on a regular basis but they struggle to do this in an efficient and controlled way many use email or ftp or have brought consumergrade file sharing apps into their company exposing themselves to security risks i saw an opportunity to address this issue so we stepped back and did some market research on where our customers are going and what issues they’re facing we surveyed  business and it leaders and followed that up with a series of direct interviews with around  of those leaders to get very specific details about what was needed in the market through that we were able to identify five categories of client needs that were shifting in the technology market regarding how they share information outside of their enterprise first our clients want technology that is extremely secure and allows them to have full control over their information at all times no matter where it travels second they want more control from an it perspective third they want easeofuse so that their end users will be able to comfortably and easily collaborate outside their company and create ad hoc work streams fourth it in particular needs better management tools so they understand where information is traveling who has access and so on and fifth our clients want better connections to their current internal enterprise systems it was this research that led us to develop our new product intralinks via what was really fascinating about our research was the amount of people who communicated that they really need to share information in order to get work done there has been a lot of talk about filesharing opportunities in the marketplace today but our new product intralinks via is unique in that it not only allows companies to share their information in a filesharing format but to do so in a controlled manner within a work stream outside of the enterprise i think it’s important for cios and cisos to understand that you really have to think holistically beyond the firewall rather than trying to attack it in pieces—everything from data location right through to the concepts of work streams and the chain of custody for documents and content that issue has continued to be a topic of discussion particularly regarding which devices people are going to use to access this information it’s essentially becoming byoc—bring your own collaboration what’s driving this trend the consumerization of it is having profound effects it’s routine now for employees to use multiple consumer platforms to do work and increasingly this means that they’re coopting their personal dropbox account or google drive to share business information we factored this in when we designed intralinks via we knew that we needed a solution that was intuitive and easy to us for example a native feature built into the ipad framework is the ability to switch between screens by flipping your hand to the right or left because customers are used to that framework we have to think about how our applications operate within that native toolset and adapt accordingly our research communicated the necessity of that loud and clear as a matter of fact our market research shows that over  percent of our customers wanted us to make sure that the intralinks via product was driven by the native tools on various platforms—ios platform android and windows so we did the extra work to make sure that our software operates on those devices in the way that our consumers are used to using them so byoc could also mean “bring your own consumer” because of the consumer collaborative phenomenon happening in the technology market fortunately it doesn’t have to worry about that problem anymore we’re addressing that for them on whatever device they choose is this related to the concept of unsharing how does that come into the mix yes that was part of the research when we talked to consumers they asked for something very simple “give me control” we kept coming back to a conversation about wanting to share information with an outside colleague and then being able to take that information back after the work stream is completed so we’ve come up with the technology to do that we call it unsharing and it exists within the intralinks via product in two dimensions first you can place a timed expiration date on that information which means that the other user has the right to access it for say  days and after that the user can no longer access the encrypted file we also have a selfshredding feature installed as well just to make sure that the information is securely removed from that device secondly we offer the ability to revoke the permissions to that encrypted file at any time this is important whether we care to admit it or not we’ve all sent the wrong file to the wrong person and wished we’d had the ability to somehow get that file back now you can               every once in a while you read about how the amount of data generated by an organization is tripling and quadrupling are organizations seeing a greater outflow of information as the amount of data continues to increase absolutely and as i’ve mentioned before the issue with that is that most architectures were built to protect what comes into the datasets and content but not the other way around that’s why unshare is so exciting—when i download that technology on my ipad i’m synchronizing that device with my iphone and pc so there are technically three copies of that encrypted file on all three devices when i’m done sharing that information i can easily make sure that i pull all of that information off those devices that’s where we’ve seen the largest upticks in usage is there anything i didn’t ask that you think is important to share one exciting piece of news is that we are getting ready to publicly announce our first beta customer the vodafone mclaren mercedes f team as you can imagine an f racing team has a lot of proprietary data and trade secrets that they’re constantly working to protect in order to maintain their edge because it’s so tenuous in their industry in our discussions with them they shared some of the challenges they face regarding collaborations outside their firewall and their need to audit and track all of the pieces that go out most importantly they need to be able to unshare information when they’re done with a particular partner that was critical for them so they selected us to be a key partner in sharing their intellectual property and we’re very excited about working with them i’d also encourage people to try
