artifacts that evidence precolumbian exploration of america i call this the “templars in america” series as much of this exploration seems to tie back to the medieval knights templar in the books i use artifacts and historical sites to trigger modernday suspense plots as publisher weekly writes of the series “brody does a terrific job of wrapping his research in a fastpaced thrill ride” i remain fascinated by the hidden history of north america and the very real possibility that waves of european explorers visited our shores long before columbus it is my hope that readers share this

attorney conducting criminal investigation into fox news sexual harrassment case payouts cnn  politics david brody fires back at jim acosta’s ‘the fix is in’ by chris ariens on feb     amcomment cnn’s jim acosta believes “the fix is in” he said as much to wolf blitzer yesterday after for the third consecutive news conference pres trump only called on media outlets perceived to be sympathetic to his goals as the president and prime minister netanyahu left the podium at that news conference acosta shouted a question to trump about any potential ties to russia the president didn’t answer one of those who was called on was david brody the veteran white house reporter for cbn which was founded by pat robertson the former southern baptist minister and host of the  club “i was fully aware that the mainstream media would go into meltdown mode when i was called on first” brody writes in his story headlined “this just in from cnn more fake news” “the fact that the president called on me and not on any of the traditional media outlets is really what is bothering all of them they feel entitled to ask a question but the last time i checked i only see the first amendment in the us constitution i don’t see the ‘mainstream media entitlement clause’ inside” what jim acosta said on cnn wednesday is insanely ridiculous i used those words in a southern ‘bless your heart’ tone acosta’s beef may be with the white house and not necessarily outlets like cbn but to lump us in and attach that phrase to us is reckless downright wrong and insulting if the “fix was in” then there would have been dialogue about how to ask the right question there was never any of that comments  previous article next article  advertisement advertisement get tvnewser delivered straight to your

surreal and psychedelic by emily manke  october     seattle is a city brimming with artists so in order to standout and make a name for yourself you have to be different and david brody has managed to do just that the professor of painting and drawing at university of washington has been making his mark on the seattle art scene for the better part of the last two decades it seems like brody’s trippy work is a perfect fit for seattle’s psychedelic scene the timeline of brody’s work tells the story of his evolution as an artist on brody’s site his work is separated into time periods from  brody’s work is brightly colored and surreal with human and nonhuman subjects in sometimes dreamlike scenarios found throughout the work next from   brody’s work began to really take shape the realism element becoming finely tuned it seems that this era begins with work that draws inevitable comparisons to salvador dalí during this time period brody took his profound eye for color and detail and applied it to portraits of various female subjects and even body parts his most recent body of work took a somewhat sharp turn instead of realism with human subjects the new work plays with shapes and patterns in a style with an almost textilelike tangible feel the geometric vibrant nature of the work could certainly be described as hallucinogenic the man behind the brilliant work was kind enough to answer some questions for culture   when and how did you get started as an artist like most kids i drew when i was young i just never stopped where are you from born in new york city spent most of my life on the east coast came out here in  to take a job as a professor of painting at the university of washington in seattle which artists have influenced your work so many everything from european cave paintings to attic ceramics to song dynasty chinese scroll paintings to all the greats of the western canon to contemporary cartoonists and animators which artists have you been inspired by that you believe may have been inspired by cannabis or whose art is psychedelic in some way i don’t know about what’s been inspired by cannabis specifically but there is a lot of great surrealistic and psychedelic art and animation rene magritte’s work often has a dreamlike hallucinatory quality some artists like peter saul and ed paschke come to mind too and r crumb’s a great draftsman who’s done a
