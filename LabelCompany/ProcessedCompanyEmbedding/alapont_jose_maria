 nov   tom murphy  wardsauto email tweet comments  federalmogul’s ceo talks about the travails of bankruptcy the supplier’s prospects overseas and his upbeat outlook for next year southfield mi – josé maria alapont has been president ceo and a director of federalmogul corp since march  the supplier of originalequipment and aftermarket powertrain brake and electrical components spent six years in bankruptcy court a victim of asbestos litigation before exiting in  he responded to questions via email the interview was edited for length ward’s you’ve had almost six years at federalmogul three years in bankruptcy and three years out what is it like to go through bankruptcy what advice would you give for successfully restructuring and emerging from bankruptcy alapont bankruptcy is a very challenging and tough process and companies should always do their best to avoid it when i joined federalmogul the company was already more than four years into bankruptcy but with the new strategy we managed to exit successfully within the following two years the fundamental thing to succeed in bankruptcy is to separate the court process from the company business federalmogul dealt efficiently with the issues of bankruptcy while staying intensely focused on running daytoday operations as a successful business we delivered on commitments and emerged with an even larger customer base and solid product portfolio in place this enabled federalmogul to keep developing and executing our strategy for sustainable global profitable growth another important point is to maintain throughout the process a strong focus on future customer and market requirements by investing in leading technology and innovation federalmogul invested more than  billion in engineering and capital investment since  to keep our technology pipeline flowing and modernize our facilities to deliver worldclass technology innovation and quality ward’s federalmogul grew rapidly through the s then closed  facilities since  as part of restructuring driven by bankruptcy and overall market downturn how do you size up your current manufacturing footprint globally do you still have more capacity than you need alapont federalmogul has implemented an extensive restructuring to shift our footprint to be in line with the global markets our bestcost manufacturing capacity has grown in the last five years from about  of total capacity to more than  today special coverage state of the industry north america that means that while we were closing uncompetitive sites we also opened greenfield sites in china india brazil russia eastern europe and other global markets where it was a strategic necessity to establish a local manufacturing and engineering capability to support market and customer growth today we have a very strong global footprint including  sites in china with a new stateoftheart technical center seven sites in india six sites in south america and two in russia our asiapacific technical center in shanghai is one of  around the world this wellequipped engineering hub with a facility of around  sqft  sqm provides technology development and customer application support for our entire portfolio to serve domestic chinese and other global auto makers located in the asiapacific region our investment is paying off ward’s there was a time when federalmogul wanted to be a megasupplier serving broad portions of both the aftermarket and oe segments is the era of the megasupplier over is it unwise for a supplier to attempt to be all things to all customers alapont one of federalmogul’s strengths is our customer market and product portfolio diversification federalmogul products are present in more than  vehicle platforms and  powertrains and no customer represents more than  of total sales we believe serving oe and aftermarket customers is a key advantage for the company as we can leverage our product development investment originally in the oe market to support both the original equipment service channel and the independent aftermarket sales channel we have leading market positions in our oe product lines like pistons and rings sealing bearings systems protection and friction material as well as more than  leading brands in product categories like engine chassis friction lighting wipers and service products ward’s from your perspective is the recession over and has the recovery begun or do you see the possibility of a “doubledip” recession on the horizon alapont we have seen a global recovery of the economy in general and the automotive industry in particular all indications point to steady market strengthening although at lower levels in mature markets and continued strong growth in china india brazil russia and other high growth markets federalmogul in the meantime is showing very strong sales growth across all markets on a yeartodate basis north america is up  europe up  china revenue is up  brazil is up  and russia is up over  ward’s every company needs great technology to survive bad times what technologies are you most confident will be game changers alapont we are continuously launching new technology and products that help improve fuel economy manage higher combustion pressures reduce emissions and increase overall powertrain and vehicle efficiency we recently launched durabowl pistons featuring a special remelting process that hardens the crown of the piston to ensure high combustion temperature and pressure does not impact the durability of high performance boosted downsized engines for commercial vehicles we just introduced the magnum monosteel piston a new design for offhighway and commercialvehicle engines that reduces piston friction by up to  and reciprocating mass by  our irox engine bearings are a great example of federalmogul’s ability to solve new technology challenges with specially engineered solutions irox is a polymer coated engine bearing that is highly suited to the poor lubrication conditions present in stopstart engines used in today’s hybrids or to recharge evs the customer reaction has been very positive and we are launching irox on new powertrain applications beginning in the first quarter of  we also have several new nao brake formulations and are developing low copper formulations designed to help customers attain future regulatory requirements for brake pads ward’s how would you describe the current state of your supply base are your suppliers financially healthier than they were a year ago how many suppliers remain on your “watch list” alapont the number of suppliers that are closely monitored has decreased since the low point of the market downturn and we do not foresee any risks since we have over the last few years developed a strong dualsource strategy for the majority of our purchased products and materials we have been working on supplier development especially in the growing markets like china india brazil and eastern europe to establish reliable sources of supply for materials and components we are making good progress in developing the necessary localized supplier network to meet our needs and thereby to have a worldclass competitive localized supplier base ward’s if you couldnt work in the auto industry what would you be doing alapont i have been enjoying this challenging industry during the last  years  with global vehicle manufacturers and another  with suppliers – and definitely i would do it all over again other than this i could be interested in global financial investments ward’s what is the one sign you are waiting for before you declare the us market ready to rock again alapont the us market has already started to rock again and we expect it to keep rocking even harder in  ward’s what’s the most interestingchallenging part of your job alapont developing a worldclass diversified and leading federalmogul with a bestinclass team capable to satisfy customers shareholders and employees by generating sustainable global profitable growth based on technology innovation and quality excellence in products and services at a competitive cost ward’s what are you looking forward to driving in  alapont together with my wife we have recently driven cadillac toyota mercedes and lincoln models we recently had a new jeep grand cherokee and chevrolet volt for a test drive at our headquarters and both were very good there are so many great vehicles coming to market it is hard to choose but i always enjoy getting behind the wheel of new vehicles that feature federalmogul products including the latest from ferrari porsche and
