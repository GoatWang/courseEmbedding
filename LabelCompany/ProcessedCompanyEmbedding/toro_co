sprinkler system are the controller stationcontrol valves and sprinklers the controller is the brain of the system telling the control valves when and how long to supply water to the sprinklers the sprinklers direct and control the water applied to the lawn and plants each valve controls a specific group of sprinklers called a watering station the stations are generally laid out and installed according to the type of plant material to be watered the location of the plant within the landscape and the maximum amount of water that can be supplied each valve is connected to a numbered terminal within the controller identifying it as station  station  etc the controller operates the valves in order one at a time in other words one station would water completely before another station would turn on this is called a watering cycle the information stored in the controller memory that determines when and how long the stations will water is called a program what is a watering program a watering program requires three basic instructions to operate automatically what days to water  called watering days when to water  called a program start time how long to water  called station run time why do some controllers have multiple programs many yards have plants with different water requirements ie lawns that require everyday watering shrubs that only require watering every other day etc therefore the lawn stations can be assigned to a different program than the shrubs with a single program timer all stations would have to water on the same days water seeps from one sprinkler is there something wrong with the sprinkler no water will drain through the lowest head until the pipe empties if the seepage does not stop the problem is with the valve that controls that sprinkler zone the problem could be as simple as a small piece of debris inside the valve warning shut off the water supply before disassembling the valve one zone continues to water after the cycle is complete is the controller broken probably not but to make sure pull the power cord from the wall removing power from the controller if the water continues to run the problem is with the zone valve if the water stops the controller is at fault doublecheck the programming about toro corporate responsibility financing customer support safety lawn care dealer login newsroom investors careers connect with us

higher  run the engine for five minutes to warm the oil so it drains better recommend only filling fuel tank with enough gas to run for five minutes before changing oil remove the dipstick tip the mower onto its side air filter side up to drain the used oil out through the oil fill tube into a drain pan tipping the machine on its side is the recommended method by engine manufacturers let oil drain completely tip the mower back up on its wheels and slowly pour new oil into the oil fill tube until oil level reaches the full line on the dipstick  to properly check the oil level  wait one or two minutes after filling the engine with oil to allow it to settle  wipe the dipstick clean reinsert dipstick remove dipstick and check oil level repeat the process a second time important do not overfill  if you overfill the engine with oil you will need to remove the excess oil by following the oil draining  steps listed above   too much oil can cause engine damage or failure  for complete stepbystep instructions please consult your owners manual how do i store the battery on my mower battery storage for any battery used on our products we recommend storing it in a cool dry place removing the battery is not necessary storing it in a heated or warm area during the winter will actually shorten the batterys life the best thing to do is to make sure it is fully charged at the end of each season then store the product away in a cool or cold dry place the story behind batteries batteries selfdischarge due to a chemical reaction the warmer the battery the faster the reaction resulting in greater loss a loss of  per day in warm temperatures is normal storing a battery in a cool or cold area will greatly slow this reaction  a fully charged battery will not freeze during the winter a discharged battery may freeze freezing a battery usually damages it to the point of failure fully charge the battery in the fall and it will not freeze  when a battery is stored in a discharged state or allowed to discharge completely while in storage a process called sulfation occurs sulfation also occurs normally with batteries while they are in use but at a very slow rate  eventually this process is one of the things that contribute to a battery going bad think of sulfation as an aging process some sulfation can be reversed when the battery is charged but not all batteries left in a discharged state will sulfate heavily  the consequence of this is a loss of battery capacity the battery runs down quicker  eventually the battery can become so sulfated there is not enough capacity left to crank the engine at all battery life if the battery is well cared for it will typically last  years in a battery powered product good care means charging the product fully immediately after each usebattery powered mowers are to be left plugged in between uses leaving a machine with a partially or completely discharged battery is one of the worst things you can do

from my transmission the noise is not from the transmission but rather is coming from the belt tapping the deck this noise is an inherent part of mower operation and does no harm to your toro mower why do the wheels lock up when pulling back my rear wheel drive selfpropel mower  super recycler mowers the design of the toro rocking key wheel engagement system requires two things to occur prior to disengaging the first requirement is for the drive belt to become slack for personal pace models the operator simply needs to stop walking and allow the handle to move rearward the rearward position removes all tension from the engagement cable and the belt becomes slack for single or threespeed transmissions the bail must be released to remove tension on the drive cable  the second requirement involves the mower rolling forward a few inches with the belt slack the mower must roll forward a few inches with the belt slack during normal operation on fairly level turf this process should happen without effort also if your mowers drive cable is not adjusted correctly the keys will not disengage without extra effort see your operators manual for applicable drive cable adjustment procedures another cause of this difficulty is too much or too little grease in the rear pivot arms  recycler mowers note there will be some slight resistance when the mower is pulled backwards compared to when the mower is pushed forwards    possible causes of the mower rear wheels locking up or skidding when the unit is pulled backwards are the tractiondrive cable is kinked replace cable debris is caught

do not have a throttle control a throttle control would allow you to vary the engine speed from idle all the way up to full speed we have found not having it actually increases engine life and product performance here are some of the reasons full throttle operation is best cleaner cut on the grass more power less likely to bog down less stress on the engine engine runs cooler full speed means more cooling air from the flywheel area slow engine speeds can result in hot spots on the cylinder on units with throttle control we recommend full throttle operation while in use throttling down for a

more frequently overlap the cutting swaths instead of cutting a full swath with each pass set the cutting height on the front wheels one notch lower than the rear wheels for example set the front wheels at  inches and the rear wheels at   inches alternate mowing direction to keep the grass standing straight  this helps disperse clippings which enhances decomposition and fertilization clean the clippings and dirt from the underside of the mower after each use grass build up inside the mower will affect cutting quality for additional tips view our online interactive manual for more information on obtaining the best quality of cut why does dirt get trapped in the grass bag the rear of the grass bag is two layers thick to stop any foreign objects that the mower might pick up however some dirt and sand will go through the first layer this is why we have intentionally left one side of the inner layer unsewn  leaving one side of this layer open allows the dirt to fall out when the bag is emptied how do i properly bag the grass we have heard reports of clippings leaking from the sides of the bag  in the upper corners of the bag there is a small plastic flap that will close off any gaps when installed correctly air pressure pushes the flap out to the frame and closes off the opening if the bag is assembled with the flap on the outside the air pressure will blow the flap open and clippings can escape the flap is large enough so that if installed inside it will stay there simply push the flap inside the frame why does the grass fall out of the bag if the bag is improperly mounted the hooks will not properly engage the mower this bag should not rest on the handle cross bar if it does the bottom of the bag will not fill up to the chassis and grass will fall out when the bag is properly mounted it sets below the handle cross bar and will fit up to the mower housing correctly bag frame may be bent  see your local authorized service dealer for assistance is
