northern america and appointed shawn edmunds as vicepresident northern america results of operations although the vast majority of our cost base is carried out in euros we report our financial statements in us dollars usd the conversion of euros and usd leads to periodtoperiod fluctuations in our reported usd results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the usd and the euro generally when the usd strengthens relative to the euro it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses conversely when the usd weakens relative to the euro it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses the above fluctuations in the usdeuro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects not to be confused with real currency exchange effects which impact our reported usd results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses which are attributable to our actual operating activities we carry out our business activities primarily in euros and we do not currently engage in hedging activities the following table shows the usd equivalent of the major currencies for the year ended december   usd equivalent comparison of years ended december   and  revenue revenue for the year ended december   was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december   the continued and expected market decline of landline based telecommunications caused our legacy landline business to decrease by  or  to  as of december   this decrease in landline business was offset by the increase in revenues from our mobile and security solutions business to  in  which increased by  or  compared to  in  the increase in our mobile and security solutions business is mainly due to the migrations of customers onto our mobile platforms resulting in contractual billings to our customers increasing from  in  to  in  in  total billings were  and  was recognized in revenue with the remainder deferred over the remaining contract period in accordance with asc  in  the total billings were  and  was recognized in revenue with the remainder deferred over the remaining contract period in accordance with asc  for further details see nongaap revenue discussion below   restated landline services     mobile and security solutions   total revenue     note  financial condition in this annual report discusses the likely nongaap revenue in order to provide investors additional information regarding our revenue we include here the discussion of nongaap revenue as a result of the characteristics of our services the longterm nature of the contracts and the small customer base new and substantial sales will remain unnoticed to the investors due to the fact that most of these sales will need to be deferred over a period of  years our nongaap financial measure is defined as gaap revenue adjusted for changes in deferred revenue we believe this nongaap measure provides useful information regarding our actual billings to our customers during the period which generally reflect the usage rates of our hosted platforms the presentation of nongaap revenue is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to gaap revenue the company therefore adds back to the revenue in the income statement the revenues that were invoiced in the reporting period at the same time the company removes from the revenue in the income statement the revenues that have been recognized as a result of sales prior to the reporting period these two adjustments we refer to as changes in deferred revenue a reconciliation of gaap revenue to nongaap revenue for each of the periods indicated is as follows nongaap revenue   restated variance revenues       deferred revenue adjustments          total nongaap revenue increased by  the phasing out of our landline activities caused our landline nongaap revenue to be  million lower than that of the previous year this was however more than offset by the  million increase in the mobile and security solutions business the vast majority of the revenue increase in our mobile and security solutions business was the result of the customer based sim subscriber identity modules migrations of our customer iusacell in mexico the remainder of the mobile and security growth was only modest in  due to the reduced revenues from nonrecurring custom work projects with customers compared to  following the likely termination of the iusacell contract and considering the size of iusacell to our overall revenues the termination of this contract will have a substantial impact on our revenues we are currently evaluating the proposal of iusacell including assessing the impact on future revenues historic quarterly overview nongaap and gaap revenue nongaap revenue q  q  q  q   revenue       changes in deferred revenue
