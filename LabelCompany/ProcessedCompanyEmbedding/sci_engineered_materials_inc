home  company historycompany history the late dr edward funk scd and his late wife ingeborg founded superconductive components inc in  dr funk formerly a professor of metallurgy at the ohio state university and a successful entrepreneur envisioned significant market potential for the newly discovered high temperature superconductivity hts material ybco tc of ° k the company’s first product was a  pure coprecipitated ybco  powder over the years the company expanded its product line by adding other high tc powders sintered shapes single crystal substrates and nonsuperconducting sputtering targets in  superconductive components inc became a publicly held company and currently trades under the symbol scia the stock continues to trade under this symbol on the otcqb exchange superconductive components inc opened a subdivision target materials inc tmi in  to supply the increasing worldwide demand for sputtering and laser ablation targets tmi became a full service manufacturer of high performance thin film materials providing a wide selection of metals ceramics and alloys for sputtering targets evaporation sources and other pvd applications tmi served the rd as well as the industrial and decorative coating markets during this time tmi began to manufacture targets for the photovoltaic flat panel display and semiconductor industries in july of  the company’s two divisions superconductive components inc and target materials inc were merged the resulting company operates under the name sci engineered materials™ the company began to manufacture complex ceramic metal and alloy products for the thin film battery photovoltaic media storage flat panel display semiconductor electronic and photonic industries by  the company needed more space for its growing business but desired to remain in columbus ohio central ohio is a regional center for materials science expertise due to the presence of the ohio state university case western reserve university the university of toledo battelle memorial institute edison welding institute nasalewis the air force research laboratory and emtec other local organizations supporting material science endeavors include the american ceramic society the orton foundation chemical abstracts and oclc as a result the company relocated to a nearby facility with  ft of manufacturing and office space in  sci engineered materials™ received iso  registration and had iso  registration dating back to  throughout its history the company has conducted funded research primarily under grants from entities such as the department of energy the national science foundation nasa and the ohio department of development these activities are generally limited to funded research that is consistent with the company’s focus on commercial applications in its principal markets over the past three decades the company has developed considerable expertise in the development and rampup manufacturing of novel materials today sci engineered materials™’ serves a diverse base of domestic and multinational corporations universities and leading research institutions sci engineered materials™ actively seeks to partner with organizations to provide solutions for difficult material challenges on august   the company’s shareholders approved the change of the corporate name to sci engineered materials inc it is consistent with the name that has been used in the company’s marketing since  and is integral to current corporate branding activities it also reflects the company’s transformation to a more
