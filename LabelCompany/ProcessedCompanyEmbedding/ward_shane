editiona favorite of mine from the pop diva all remastered with bonus video and remixes as well as rare cuts not previously availableawesome music mars hit the spot with this one seconds to mars newest cd is pop and rock with a digital twist several catchy songs and the beats are amazing listen from start to finishhonorable sellerthis cd rocks have all  from this seller awesome cds received new and within dates provided will buy from this seller againkiss is well kiss what else can be saidexcept the fact that they are one of the most amazing bands to bring the heavy in to metal and the rock into rock and roll all over great package great music great soundvery enjoyablewhile harden my heart was and still is their best song the other songs on this album are very good pop and have held up over the years snce their breakupa very classic excellent rock albumautumn rain by john lars zwerenz was a surprising treat to hear in contrast to the many kinds of alternative choices i have on todays radio and in music stores although obviously influenced by the beatles later period this record of  or so songs delivers in melodic and harmonic ways in a manner i havent heard since nirvana the album is very varied and goes from pop to main stream rock to even classical but there is never an anti climax musically i highly recommend autumn rain to all lovers of popular genres kitty roland denver cothese men make business as usual work quite wella good cd lots of quirky rythms kinetic keyboards and guitars ringing tingles of the keyboard almost like a pining of sorts especially evident on the mega hit down under whose lyrics i never figured out how to connect with the music that accompanies it the faux flute sound heard there is nowhere else on the album at least not as prominently track  i can see it in your eyes starts with a triumphant key stroke almost like a rebel yell fist raise for the forlorn the songs are mostly high notes on the first  original album tracks then take an increasingly dark turn as the album closes touching the untouchables has a bitterness to it although sweet nonetheless and then catch a star which is the nd to last song continues on an even more better note before down by the sea closes things out with a pounding swoosh like an evening tide theres a bside and some otherr bonus tracs i havent got around to listening to johnny b good is kind of a dumb song imo it seems to be a decrying of some peoples disdain for dreamers in society but just comes across as juvenile in its tone and structure such complex subject matter should not be treated in such a simple matter underground does a much better job at presenting its social criticisms because its not arguing with anybody except people who are probably too busy building their warchests to be taking time listening to this album in the first place which is fine because the melody is pleasant regardless of how ultimately pointless the preaching to the choir lyrics may be sure it would be better if the men in this work would focus their attentions on deeper personal matters things that they can speak firsthand about ie from the heart but this kind of music is mostly for entertainment ie mental stimulation if you want something to shake the heart and soul look elsewhere there is an emotional component to this music but isnt there always at least a shred of that nonetheless for what it is its quite good i think it holds up better than most of the stuff from  and i think i can say so since i wasnt a teenager in  or  even my teen years were during this albums th anniversary and i remember hearing down under on the radio frequently back then a lot of music from this time period people insist holds up well just because they havent forgotten about it or grown tired of it i do think this music fits with the s better than it does the s ever since the tea party was sworn in everyones been so concerned about gay rights and womens rights and sexual politics is almost all you hear on the radio anymore theres some exceptions obviously i probably dont keep up with modern radio music enough to say whats what i mostly listen to alternative rock with pop leanings but the top songs on spotify are almost entirely rap music with expletives galore ive probably gotten a little off topic herethanks if you bothered to bear with me on that really got nothing to say except if youre not sure you wanna buy this after reading this try using spotify either on an internet browser or the app good luck and gnightremastered versrsion is a must haveled zeppelin is a rocknroll category by itself here is a band that will never even be remotely reproduced instead what has been remastered is the song remains the same and this version is a must have for all rocknroll fans recorded in  at madison square garden this cd is at about led zeppelins peak and surely proves there is no other band like lzsponsored linkswhats thisgeneral rockpophard rockart rockalt countryrock

album the £ hes charging his fans for ten minutes is nothing compared to the price of xfactors fast fame for its contestants photo of shane ward via youtube if youre lonely and need someone to talk to or if somehow you cannot find it in your heart to forget the  winner of the second series of the x factor then i have a cracking deal for you shayne ward he of eponymous shayne ward  album fame is available to talk to you on skype for ten minutes for the price of £ news of shaynes descent has served as backhanded press for his new album called closer to be released this coming april hes crowdfunding it through a site called pledgemusic where for £ you can buy shaynes cardigan by a brand called izzue for £ you can have a private shayne show and for £ you can purchase those ten sexy minutes on skype its a troubling career move for the man who had the uks thirdfastest selling single of all time thatsmy goal which stayed in the charts a full  weeks nope me neither pledgemusic for all the independence it grants artists marks a curious new level of licenced privacy invasion with celebrities selling their time their phone numbers and levels of access in the manner of cam girls with auctions for clothes pictures and the space in his album liner notes its hard not to think that shayne wards star has crashed to earth and hes selling off pieces of the rubble then again ward has always belonged in a sense to the public as with any product of a tv talent show in his first appearance on x factor back in  hes a yearold shop assistant wearing baggy bleached denim and giant cubic zirconia earrings i like the fact that you dont look stage school says simon smelling the possibility of money you look real its a gorgeously creepy thing to tell one of the earlier stars of reality tv ward was blandly agreeable as the x factors second winner a crewcut silkyvoiced vision of generic masculinity groomed to triumph over andy abraham it was acknowledged from the start that he would trade on his looks hamming it up in a succession of topless calendar shoots which remain in production to this day its not too late readers – s calendar features ward in a wet t shirt ward forever treads the line between mancuniannextdoor and campy oiledup adonis catering to young gay men and straight women as well as their mothers in pictures he is forever pulling his clothes off or inexplicably getting them wet in some wards shirt and jumper appear to have been awkwardly photoshopped back on again while in others he is drowning in knitwear he served as an early prototype for the peculiar brand of twee male objectification allowed for in tv talent shows matt cardle gareth gates will young jedward joe mcelderry a succession of inoffensive boys who ran succinctly alongside the shows female divas the line reaches its apex in harry styles and its nadir in frankie cocozza whos a delight on twitter by the way many of these tv boymen have since vanished where do you go after youve sold your lifes story by way of introduction after youve given away as louis walsh put it one million percent its as if we knew from the start that shayne and his ilk were onetrick acts indulging them as christmas number ones with seasonal goodwill none of the xfactors stars ever tried to keep their lives secret from the press they gave their stories away early accelerating the process of getting to know them before reality tv we were allowed to grow up with pop stars and follow them from their inception on crappy soaps or childrens daytime tv to international stardom the x factor along with its precursor popstars condensed this process into short hyperemotional tv cycles sealing the deal with the overpriced phone call you inevitably made to vote wed grow tired of their products similarly quickly leaving former stars relying on overpriced skype calls to get by x factor has bred so many lowertier celebrities that no tabloid can contain them perhaps ward owes it to his fans to remain accessible and perhaps we owe it to him to pay for his tootight designer shirts photo of simon cowell via wiki commons dissent in the x factor ranks is minimal even long after their fame fades and simon cowells syco label drops them even after he was excluded from x factors ten year reunion show along with leon jackson matt cardle and series  winner steve brookstein ward claimed that he was not bitter brookstein only voiced his complaints a decade later in his book getting over the x which sold with a quote printed on the cover from max clifford talk to the press and well bury you he has since taken to twitter to attack louis tomlinson and his legion of rabid fans as if leveraging the publics x factor bitterness into a surrogate career for all the ups and downs of his career ward appears to have remained a good egg last year was a busy one for him he turned  posed for his calendar and attitude magazine recorded an album due for release this year and starred in a stage production of war of the worlds alongside brian mcfadden and jason donovan in september he judged a girl band contest in manchester where he was billed in a newspaper as ex factors shayne ward shayne wards twitter profile has a blue verified tick and k followers even if only a fraction of that figure are hardcore he retains a steady fan base pledgemusic the directtofanplatform facilitating his skype calls and wardrobe sale crowdfunds artists without retaining rights to their music its list of alumni and current users is bafflingly varied ranging from peter andre to erasure to stiff little fingers to lcd soundsystem they claim a  percent success rate maybe its not so ignoble a fate to sell your time in ten minute increments maybe ward is just one facet of modern celebrity where its acceptable to crowdfund a tour and weather the criticism or blithely practise the art of asking more than you practise your actual songs music has regressed into a form of highprofile busking its needy but commendably independent at the same time beyonce even nods to her past in tv talent shows at the beginning of flawless if only to stamp all over it later with a hymn to her own power whether a celebrity selling their time on skype a sign of humility or one last hubristic act of delusion its hard to grudge them a certain pragmatism ward always had the ear of the public and he still does today it just happens to be one ear at a time now roisinthemirror more stuff like this man or woman bruce jenner is a human being what kind of politician would jeremy kyle be bez forgot to register his antifracking party so now no one can vote for him
