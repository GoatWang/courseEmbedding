first half of the year stocks rallied due to strong corporate earnings record ma activity cooling inflation worries and in the absence of fed tightening the markets climb was interrupted by global liquidity concerns in february and again in late june and july of  amid a credit crunch brought about by rising subprime mortgage defaults however accommodative actions by the fed in late summerearly fall propelled the markets higher and the sp  reached a record high of  in early october as fed remarks allayed investor concerns that the economy was headed for recession however stocks pulled back sharply during the balance of the fourth quarter reflecting investor concerns over the economic impact of the housing and creditmarket turmoil and recordhigh oil prices in this environment the growth style of investing outperformed the value style for the first time in seven years large caps also outperformed small as these higherquality companies are better able to sustain earnings growth during a significant economic slowdown eight out of ten sp  sectors had positive returns and each of these was in the doubledigits led by sectors tilted toward global infrastructure investment and booming commodity prices including energy  and materials  utilities  were a good place to be and technology  showed strength as the sectors high proportion of nonus revenues promised some insulation from a slowing domestic economy the two sectors that lagged brought the index return down into the midsingle digits as the sp  returned  for the year financials  lagged the most facing credit cycle headwinds and broken balance sheets consumer discretionary  also lagged the broad market as the recession debate increased q what were the primary drivers of fund performance a the funds preference for large high quality companies paid off in a year where stock market volatility increased underweighting financials  the sp s worst performing sector  was the funds primary driver of outperformance underweighting commercial banks and consumer finance companies as well as focusing on state street  within the capital markets industry provided key downside protection strong stock selection in the

partially offsetting the funds broadbased strength were negative contributions from healthcare and telecommunications most notable was a pullback in amgen  which suffered amid safety concerns regarding its anemia drugs and increased fda scrutiny however we continued to like the strength in amgens pipeline of biotech products and its longterm prospects our continued underweight in telecommunications was another key detractor while we have been adding to our position in att  our underweight versus the benchmark hampered returns as did the lag in latin wireless provider nii holdings  we continued to believe that the cable companies would be more successful taking share from phone companies rather than vice versa hence our larger relative weighting in media taking a longterm view unfortunately disappointing results at cable giant comcast  detracted from relative performance this year q were there any significant changes to the fund over the period a there were no significant changes to the fund during the year as we have remained committed to investing in high quality largecap stocks with predictable and steady earnings growth at compelling valuations we continue to be relatively defensively positioned although at yearend our largest overweight was in technology  an area that we believe could benefit from multiple expansion in the months to come due to the large international component of tech earnings and its above average growth prospects overall our tech holdings tend not to be the most economically sensitive with high recurring revenues and ample free cash flow we added to our overweight in consumer staples and materials during the period we also capitalized on strength in the energy and utilities sectors to take some profits and we reduced our overweight in healthcare due to some increased uncertainty in the risk landscape the us has experienced economic growth that we believe was below potential in  and earnings growth has slowed we are constructive on our positioning in this environment and the high quality of our holdings we had expected the companies in the funds portfolio to demonstrate the financial flexibility and balance sheet strength to weather a midcycle slowdown and to be bolstered by a flight to quality in skittish markets valuations of larger highquality companies sold at little or no premium in the past year we believe that many of our stock selections will benefit from improving valuations and superior relative earnings growth in addition many of our multinationals will likely benefit from strong growth outside of north america we remain focused on a longterm investment horizon and continue to utilize a bottomup researchdriven fundamental approach to stock selection

subsidiary of general electric company  summary of significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates the following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the funds security valuation and transactions a funds portfolio securities are valued generally on the basis of market quotations equity securities generally are valued at the last reported sales price on the primary market in which they are traded portfolio securities listed on nasdaq are valued using the nasdaq official closing price which may not necessarily represent the last sale price if no sales occurred on the exchange or nasdaq that day the portfolio security generally is valued using the last reported bid price debt securities other than shortterm securities described below generally are valued at an evaluated bid as reported by an independent pricing service values obtained from pricing services are based on various factors such as market transactions dealer supplied valuations security characteristics and other market data in the absence of a reliable price from such a pricing service debt securities may be valued based on dealer supplied valuations or quotations shortterm investments with remaining maturities of sixty days or less at the time of purchase are valued on the basis of amortized costs all assets and liabilities of the funds initially expressed in foreign currency values will be converted into us dollars at the wm exchange rate computed at  am eastern time if prices are not readily available for a portfolio security or if it is believed that a price for a portfolio security does not represent its fair value the security may be valued using procedures approved by the funds board of trustees that are designed to establish its fair value those procedures require that the fair value of a security be established by the fair valuation committee the fair valuation committee follows different protocols for different types of investments and circumstances the fair value procedures may be used to value any investment by any fund in the appropriate circumstances examples of the types of securities that may be fair valued include thinly traded or illiquid investments highyield securities or foreign securities foreign securities may be valued with the assistance of an independent fair value pricing service in circumstances where it is believed that  pncsrth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th december   notes to financial statements  they have been or would be materially affected by events occurring after the close of the portfolio securitys primary market and before the close of regular trading on the nyse this independent fair value pricing service uses a computerized system to appraise affected securities and portfolios taking into consideration various factors and the fair value of such securities may be something other than the last available quotation or other market price geam may also separately monitor portfolio securities and consistent with the funds fair value procedures apply a different value to a portfolio security than would be applied had it been priced using market quotations or by an independent fair value pricing service determining the fair value of securities involves the application of both subjective and objective considerations security values may differ depending on the methodology used to determine their values and may differ from the last quoted sale or closing price no assurance can be given that use of these fair value procedures will always better represent the price at which a fund could sell the affected portfolio security security transactions are accounted for as of the trade date realized gains and losses on investments sold are recorded on the basis of identified cost for both financial statement and federal tax purposes in september  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no  fair value measurements fas  fas  establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fas  applies

fair value the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements management of the ge ss program mutual fund and the ge ss income fund does not believe the

feedback technical chart when first displayed a technical chart contains six months worth of daily price activity with the open high low and close for each bar presented in a display box above the chart each data point can be viewed by moving your mouse through the chart the vertical bars below the chart represent volume and are colorcoded to indicate market activity for the day an up day where the price is greater than the previous price will show a green bar a down day where the price is less than the previous price will show a red bar when the price is unchanged compared to the previous price volume will show as a blue bar on futures charts the horizontal purple line above the volume bars represents open interest technical charts have the option to create spread charts  with the ability to choose from a number of common spreads such as corn  soybeans crush and wheat butterfly or allowing you to enter your own custom spread calculation supporting all futures equities index and forex symbols chart settings a chart form resides below the chart this is where you can change the symbol style time frame and other chart settings if you are logged in to your my barchart account you will also see a dropdown list for any chart templates youve previously saved simply select one from the list and the settings on the template will be applied to the current chart basic chart bar type  choose from ohlc bars candlesticks hollow candlesticks line or area volume on  displays or hides the volume for the symbol time frame  determines the period frequency and amount of data that will be displayed on the chart time period and startend dates for frequency choose from intraday daily weekly or monthly for commodity contracts you may also select a chart for the contract nearest futures contract or a continuation chart nearest futures and continuation charts commodity charts have three additional frequencies for daily weekly and monthly data contract nearest and continuation dailyweeklymonthly contract will plot prices for that specific contract dailyweeklymonthly nearest futures will use whatever contract was the nearest futures contract on the date of the given bar the price box at the top shows the contract that was used to build the corresponding bar dailyweeklymonthly continuation chart will always use the same month specified in the chart form to build the given bar the price box at the top shows the contract that was used in this case december or z  the information is backdated to the start of the period so on a minute chart information in the period dated  includes all trades between  and  inclusive a trade at  would be included within the next bar dated  a default time period is set based on your frequency setting for example an intraday chart will use a time period of  days while a daily chart uses a time period of  months you may change the time period to increase or decrease the density of the bars displayed on the chart the longer the time frame the closer together the individual bars the shorter the time frame the more distance between the bars you may override or further define the time period or generate a historical chart by entering a start and end date for the data for example you can get a daily chart with  months of data from one year ago by entering an end date from one year back display settings  further define what the chart will look like price box  when checked displays a data view window as you mouseover the chart showing ohlc for the bar and all indicator values for the given bar price scale  when on scale on the right of the chart shows prices  change scale  when on scale on the right of the chart shows the percent change from the open linear scale  when on scaling will calculate the most intelligent scale using the high the low and a series of acceptable divisors for possible scales logarithmic scale  when on uses logarithmic scaling instead of the linear scaling spread chart spread charts allow you to choose from a number of common commodity spread chart calculations you may also create your own custom spread chart by selecting up to three commodity contracts and multipliers or by entering your own custom spread expression the calculated results are displayed as a line chart expression shows the calculation used to create the chart when you select a common spread from the dropdown list or when you create a futures spread using the fields on the form the expression is built automatically for you if you want to create your own custom expression you can enter the calculation directly into the expression field valid syntax for an expression calculation includes the use of addition  subtraction  multiplication  and division  between each leg calculations are performed from left to right unless you change the order of the calculation using parentheses examples ibmdell subtracts the last price of dell from ibm ibmdell multiplies ibm by two then adds the price of dell dellibm multiplies dell by two then divides by three then adds ibm dellibm multiplies dell by two then divides the result by the sum of three plus ibm dxyspx subtracts the sp  index from the dollar index usdcadcadaud adds the canadian dollaraustralian dollar to the us dollarcanadian dollar note for futures contracts barcharts charting application commonly uses the  symbol on futures contracts as a shortcut to specify the month for example zc will return the front month zc returns the second month out zc returns the third month out etc when creating a custom expression using futures contracts you must use parentheses to group the order of the calculation in the expression zczczc will add the front second and third months for corn then divide the result by three zczzchzck will add december  corn march  corn and may  corn together then divide the results by three zczc will multiply the front month for corn by  then add the result to the third month out for corn multiplied by two zc will take the second month out for corn and multiply the price by   common spreads choose from a number of common commodity spreads the expression will be displayed once youve made a selection from the list create a futures spread select up to three different commodities including the month year multiplier and function     between the second and third leg the expression will be built and displayed in the expression field as you enter the different legs of the spread comparison chart  select up to three symbols to compare against this will generate a chart with the price data of the symbols overlayed to produce a chart of percent changes between symbols check the percent change box the colors of the boxes green purple red indicate the color of the line that will be drawn on the chart for the symbol you may also indicate whether to display that symbols price scale on the left side of the chart by default prices will all display on the right side studies  parameters select the
