mentioned  file manager which could be included in the gen but hasnt been  and yes other minor differences for anyone reading this post trying to decide between the two assuming the gen would save you money id definitely pay around  to  dollars more for a gen just because its considerably more polished and more functional dmac   utc  the model im looking at buying is at costco wdtv wd live hd media
