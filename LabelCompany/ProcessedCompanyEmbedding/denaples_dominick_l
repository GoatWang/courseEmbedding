taxes on interest income from a  settlement the state paid them for land for the casey highway a us tax court judge has ruled in a ruling issued tuesday senior judge arthur l nims iii backed the internal revenue service which argued the denapleses could not exempt part of the interest in the settlement from taxation as they did on their   and  tax returns judge nims ruled on an appeal of an irs decision by louis denaples and his wife betty ann and his brother dominick denaples and his wife mary ann efforts to reach the denapleses through a spokeswoman and their lawyer on the tax case attorney barry h frank of philadelphia were unsuccessful the case dates back to the s when the state department of transportation was building the mile highway and needed to acquire land for it the denaplesowned land bought by penndot included  separate properties but the property that received the major public attention was  acres in louis and dominick denaples keystone sanitary landfill in dunmore the state wanted to acquire the land through its power of eminent domain which allows governments to take private land in exchange for fair compensation the lackawanna county board of view which decides disputes on land value in eminent domain cases set the value of the  acres at  million based partly on the value of trash the landfill would no longer be able to accept believing the valuation excessive penndot appealed to county court a few days into the trial it was interrupted by the settlement announced nov   by transportation secretary bradley l mallory under the settlement penndot agreed to pay  million to resolve the dispute over the  acres and the denapleses claims on the other  properties along the highway of that  was for the value of the land and  was interest some of it dating back to  between the two denaples families they reported a total of  of the interest as taxable but excluded from their returns  in interest arguing it was taxexempt under irs rules in his opinion judge nims said the interest could not be excluded because the denapleses had not shown the amount of interest paid by penndot was excessive and because state law requires interest to be paid in settlements lawyers for the denapleses had argued the excluded interest was the part that was excessive and was a product of negotiations and was paid through state borrowing rather than because state law required interest to be paid the ruling also sheds some light on the structure of the denaples family companies it shows dominick and louis denaples each own half shares of dl realty which owns thousands of acres of land in the region half shares of keystone co and half shares of rail realty inc rail realty is the sole owner of fl realty inc another large landowning company based on the denapleses calculations penndot paid  of interest for a day delay of payment on the  fair market value of keystone cos share of keystone landfill  in interest for a day delay on the payment of the  fair market value of fls share of the landfill  of interest for a day delay on the payment of  fair market value of dls share of the landfills mineral rights and  of interest for a day delay in payment of the  fair market value of fls share of the landfills mineral rights according to the ruling the ruling deemed the division of the dollar amounts of principal and interest in the settlement to be arbitrary rather than a mathematical computation of interest based on prevailing commercial loan rates the highway is named after late gov robert p casey the scranton native who pushed through
