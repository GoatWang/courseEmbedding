your assets leading up to retirement and more incomeoriented strategies when you get there here are some frequently asked questions faqs we receive i’d like to learn more about estate planning can you help what does it cost yes we can gsb provides free consultation regarding wills estate planning revocable living trusts as well as special needs trusts i’m not “wealthy” do i need a trust contrary to what you may think a trust can be very beneficial for people who are not “rich” do i need a trust to take advantage of your investment management services no in fact many of our customers hire us solely for our investment management expertise customers turn to us for our independent unbiased investment advice whether assets are being managed for their current use or growing them for retirement or the next generation my spouse and i are drafting our wills and are considering naming our children as executors what’s your advice serving as an executor is very time consuming and requires a level of expertise regarding filings possible tax returns as well as legal and fiduciary responsibilities unless a family member has experience in these areas it’d be wise to consider a corporate fiduciary like gsb do you charge for being named a trustee even if you are not currently acting no in fact we often recommend gsb not be the current trustee unless the situation calls for it many of our clients have peace of mind knowing we are named as a successor in their estate plans and ready to step in should they die become incapacitated or simply don’t want to bother any longer how much money do i need to retire conventional wisdom says you’ll spend  of your preretirement income each year that may hold true for some but many people actually spend more money in retirement on travel and healthcare especially in the early years of retirement despite workrelated expenses disappearing i got nervous and sold my stocks what should i do now don’t panic many people did the same because they either misunderstood the risks involved or lacked the discipline to stick to a sound plan that’s not uncommon gsb portfolio managers go to great lengths to understand each individual’s financial needs and risk tolerance then we help you stay the course which is a key to longterm success i just retired should i leave my k with my former employer or roll it over into an ira we have to analyze each situation separately but generally we advise to roll your k balance into an ira this can often be more costeffective and flexible providing a greater range of investment choices i’m getting close to retirement should i sell off my stocks and invest conservatively from now on no retirement is a major life change yet you want to take reasonable steps to make your portfolio last determining the proper mix of conservative bonds to help meet your retirement cash needs along with stocks for longerterm growth potential is something gsb portfolio managers can help you with for more information
