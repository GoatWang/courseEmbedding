categorized by significant area of activity  includes travel costs to trade shows and exhibits we expect to face strong competition from wellestablished companies and small independent companies like our self that may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our bicycles and segways renting out service we will be at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining the facilities employees financing and other resources fulfill the demands by prospective customers our opportunity to obtain customers may be limited by our financial resources and other assets we expect to be less able than our larger competitors to cope with generally increasing costs and expenses of doing business company description on july   the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada we are engaged in business of renting out bicycles and segways  newmarkt corp represents itself as bicycle and segways renting out company we are offering such service to touristic companies at the moment where tourists friends families can organize plan develop their own unique vacation on bikes and segways for along time just for a day or for a couple of hours we are in the early stages of developing our growing plan to offer a rent bicycle service in lithuania we believe that the fact that the city of vilnius where we are starting our business is popular among tourists gives the company more opportunities to succeed we currently have some revenues and some operating history the company currently has two major customers to work with we expect to get another customers and expand our service sales and our operations by the end of the fiscal year our plan of operations over the  month period following successful completion of our offering is to develop and establish our bicycles renting business by establishing our second and third office developing our website attempting to enter into more supply agreements with prospective distributors and manufacturers of bicycles and segways engage in advertising and marketing activities and hire personal and sales service specialist newmarkt corp is currently in negotiations with two potential customers trav lt and around lithuania travel agencies which are interested in our service and we are planning to sing service agreements with them in the very near future we believe that rental bicycle has never been more in demand these days now that gas prices are rising and tourists would rather rent bicycles rather than cars on a short distance of traveling our most obvious startup requirements for a renting business are bicycles segways and safety equipment a fleet of thirtythree adult and twenty one children bicycles and thirty segways we believe are enough to start rental operation further more we will buy additional portion of the equipment we consider the fact that cycling can be dangerous and in this case we will provide our customers with helmets and safety equipment the company does not maintain any liability insurance with customer injuries while renting your equipment the company is panning to expand the range of offered equipment there will be dual wheels selfbalancing electric scooter balancing electronic skateboards additional safety equipment is accordance to purchased units of equipment and initial spare parts  the company’s register address is as following po box   vegas drive  las vegas
