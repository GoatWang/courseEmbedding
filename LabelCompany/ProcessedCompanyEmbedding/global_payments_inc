against global payments electronic merchant services frontline processing and pathfinder payment solutions in connection with a “phantom debt” scheme that allegedly attempted to collect nonexistent debts from consumers the cfpb’s complaint alleges that these four payment processors facilitated transactions for multiple debt collection companies owned by marcus brown and mohan bagga according to the complaint these debt collection companies used robocalls to target millions of consumers who they then threatened in order to obtain debt payments that were not actually owed or that didn’t even exist the cfpb further alleges that global payments “ignored numerous red flags of the debt collectors’ illegal conduct including consumer disputes that described the scheme and communication problems with the debt collectors” the outcome of the cfpb’s complaint is currently pendingkey pointssales  marketing global payments hires independent sales agents and has received some complaints about its

organizations isos and independent sales agents both are also called “resellers” to market and sell its merchant accounts although this is a common marketing practice among larger processors it can result in numerous merchant complaints because the resellers’ sales tactics are hard to control in global payments’ case it appears that most of the complaints against the company can be traced back

complaints  live customer support yes most common complaint poor serviceglobal payments has a lowtomoderate complaint count for a processor of its size and time in business the most common themes within these complaints are reports of fund holds and poor customer service although hidden fees are also occasionally mentioned there is no specific circumstance that appears to result in fund holds but holds often happen because of suspicious transactions or transactions that exceeded a merchant’s processing limit since most of these complaints appear to be unique incidents they will not count heavily against the company’s rating in this sectionit is worth mentioning however that since our last update there has been an increase in complaints posted in the comment section of this review most of these comments cite poor customer service or undisclosed fees such as early termination fees the uptick in complaints contrasts with global payments’s diminishing complaint rate found on other

own standards to better understand why we adjust bbb ratings please see our rating criteriaas of this review global payments is not accredited with the better business bureau and is showing an “a” rating the company has had  complaints filed against it in the last three years all but two of which cite problems with products and service or billing and collection global payments has resolved  of these complaints to the merchants’ satisfaction most of the remaining complaints either were not satisfactorily resolved or did not receive a final assessment from the merchant two complaints received a response from global payments that the bbb determined was not made in “good faith” while another complaint received no response whatsoever in light of the company’s low complaint volume for its size we have adjusted the bbb‘s rating to a “b” for the purposes of this review global payments bottom lineoverall global payments scores reasonably well for a provider of its size and time in business many of the company’s merchant services are set up by resellers that can set their own pricing and contract terms so merchants are encouraged to negotiate aggressively and to thoroughly review

customer made a payment through the phone for two rings which are over £ k and this guy provided his address so we type in the card machine which shows matched so the card machine cleared the transaction and the guy’s driver came to pick up these ringsafter two days the global payment contacted us and inform us that was a fraud so they just recalled the money back without our explanation and the staff simply just said if that was a phone transaction then they don’t take any responsibility so we need to face this £k lost by ourselvesmy question is as an small business how can we know if the transaction is fraud or not global payment has this mobile phone payment service as long as customer provide the correct card detail and address information to us if the payment went through then it’s fine to us global payment should increase the security and inform us for any suspicious transaction but not after two daysafter this they debit us £ straight away from our account i was shocked when i noticed this so i called my back to stop that fortunately the bank took action and the £ came back to usthey said they will give us  days time to proof everything but why they just debit us straight away without noticificationlater we also notices in the past  days payment from our customers didn’t came to our account and we called global payment and the staff said the money has been cleared its our bank’s problem they hold the money so we called our bank but our bank said there is no sign shows any money coming in so we keep calling the global payment and finally a staff told us that they hold all the money because they need to recall the £this is how they treat their customer they never listen they just do whatever they want in order to avoid more loose we stopped to use them immediatelyi m horrified by this companynow i dont know how to resolve this mess i have to leave themif you still thinking of use global payment then you will definitely regret they are not

some rather rude things to me and when i asked to speak to his supervisor about this he said “that’s not going to happen” if it smells like a scam it probably is they did not ask for any company

first mistake i changed co in doing so one would think putting this kind of money through their business account someone would call to let you know something has happened or why did you leave after catching the monthly charges late i called to cancel and ask for a refund with my notes i show the date i called and what was said it was a verbal cancellation my cpa caught them charging every month still i called and now have to fill out a form to cancel because they have no records of my cancel call and i told them i’m still waiting for my refund over  worth of over paid charges i’m told no

i immediately called all these companies to inform them that i never signed up with them and they need to cancel my account the  companies cancelled my account and send me a cancellation email global payment said that they cancel the account but they never send an email then after a month they charge my account  so i called and told them that i never signed up and that i called and cancel it they said ok then they charge my account  cancellation fee i called my bank to dispute the charge but because it was about  days when i called with business account you need to dispute charges within  days

refunded all the money and after that immediately i closed my account and give them the finger this is an evil company and all they care about is money no customer service no good service no

almost thousand dollars out of my account when i try to claim it back sob’s tell me its to late when it was only two days please do not give these thieves your business you’ll really regret it i promise you— are you with global payments learn how to resolve this complaintreplywow i am not alone just like the previous reviewer  you can’t win a charge back dispute the reason is simple that is their cash cow they charge you back for charge back    they do not bother presenting your dispute to the card issuer either the fax is not clear or you did not respond on time always the same they do not use e mail so one can scan and e mail no next day deposit extra minimum processing fee extra pci fee and o customer service they suck for those who have problems with them accessing their accounts close the bank account— are you with global payments learn how to resolve this complaintreplywe have been processing through global and mercury payment systems for nearly  years this year we have had a rash of unsupported disputes filed we have lost every one even though we have supplied all signed receipts filed rebuttals and provided all documents that were requested more than not the reason why we have lost disputes that we have was because global claims to have faxed us the info on chargeback but they have supplied no copy of a fax transmission we never received the notice and when we noticed the deduction from our bank when our cpa did our monthly statement and we responded immediately we were told that we responded “too late”  weeks later global cannot offer any documented proof that notice was ever sent they simply tell us that it is computer generated notice to our fax machine each and every one of the disputes filed were customers that received medicalsurgical services took product etc one dispute was filed because the customer claims that our receptionist was “rude” she then received services paid by credit card and then filed a dispute we lost one client took product signed a nontransferablenonrefundable contract then a week later had a change of heart and disputed the charges we lost that one the merchant has  responsibility to document everything respond in an incredibly short period provide all that is requested to fight for the payment that we have earned and worked for……but global has no responsibility to give us an appropriate time frame to respond has no obligation to prove that they sent a notice and just like that we are all paying these credit card companies and loosing a ton of money this is the most unfair systemcompany and we are seriously considering not accepting credit cards any longer surely we will leave mercuryglobal— are you with global payments learn how to resolve this complaintreplyabsolutely terrible service do not use we were transferred by our credit card company from world pay to global payments on october st however between that day and november th – no credits from credit card payments have been paid into our account i have telephoned global payments  times and still nothing has been credited do not use this companyreplyit appears alot of companies who accepted card payments on the th october did not have the funds transfered into their accounts on th october as there was an issue with global payments system after spending an hour on the phone trying to rectify the matter i was told they had no real idea when the issue would be resolved  when the money would show in my account hsbc whom i bank with are now saying although theres an issue they probably will not honor standing orders due out on st november so people like me may find things like their rent bouncing all the advice i got was call back monday so i dare say i be trying to find the time to spend another hour on the phonereplycontracted with open edge a division of global payments in august of  rate was quoted as  for our car wash facility   merchant accounts and our lube facility  merchant account the merchant fees on the lube center were calculated as contracted the merchant fees on the car wash calculated to  effective rate the car wash recurring charge merchant account effective rate is around  and although the fees are substantial on that account we do not object because the volume is small and none of the cards are swiped when we contacted open edge we were advised that the accounts had been set up at different rates we were also advised by blaine with open edge that they were only willing to credit a portion of the fees on the car wash for the last six months as they believe we should have noticed they were overcharging us we calculated the difference between  and   allowing for effective lube rate of  from may of  through september of  and came to an overcharge of  open edge decided the only credit we are entitled to is  as a service provider ourselves or code of ethics dictates that regardless of the length of time it would take our customer to notice an overcharge we would refund every penny over the agreed price if you elect to use this company be sure to double check your statements especially if you have more than one account with them also be prepared to spend days and numerous emails before anyone will even address the issue with youreplydon’t ever sign up with global payments i am a new business owner i sign a  yrs contract with gp in the beginning they promise low rate and low fee however that change in one year they up both dramatically and i didn’t read the fine prints of the notice of rate increase  months prior to the change so i can’t do anything to make them adjust the rate as it was the fees goes double and i have to sign up with other company to cut loss i called and make sure they promise after  years the account will be closed yet  years passed and still they keep on charging me  dollars a month i am still trying to find ways to cut loose from them…if you are reading this and thinking what company to choose just remember anything but global paymentreplythe credit card processing machine worked intermittentantly so as a hair salon owner a staff member did hundreds of dollars of service for someone but when they paid with a credit card…it was like playing russian roulette sometime the machine accepted it and sometimes it didn’t it kept saying that the machine need to be automatically batch processed”…whatever that means not only were we not paid for services sometimes we were made to look extremely unprofessional and shady shady because we had to attempt to process their card a few times i would not recommend this processing machine to my worst enemy yes it is that bad this company is still attempting to hold me hostage for a machine that has already cost me thousands of dollars in nonacceptance of funds for services donereplyglobal payments are incompetent lying scammers please choose any other card processor over themlast year after several years of being quietly milked by gp we were approached by a rep from another card processor the deal they offered was substantially better than gp’s ripoff rates so we decided to switchwe informed gp by telephone on october   that we no longer required their services and asked for them to arrange collection of their terminal asap we had been advised to do this by the other company’s rep because of gp’s reputation for attempting to scam merchants out of a “lost or stolen terminal” charge we were assured by gp that someone would contact us from their terminal supplier to arrange collectiona month later we had heard nothing from them at that time i went into hospital and was away from my business until early january on opening mail i found that gp had written  days after i went into hospital saying that they had been unable to contact me to arrange collection they had also subsequently written informing me that i would be charged for nonreturn of the terminal i immediately rang their customer services and explained that the mail had not been read due to my hospitalisation the filipino callcentre agent assured me that i would not be chargedlater i noticed that despite that assurance my account had been raided by gp on december  for £ “terminal charge” there then followed numerous wasted hours speaking to barely understandable “customer service” agents in the phillipines being lied to fobbed off and stonewalled email contact with someone called martin also of their alleged “customer service” department also got me nothing more than a lecture on not opening my mail promptlyin communication with martin it transpired that gp’s failure to contact me was due to their employees dialling the wrong number despite this i was informed that i would have to wait until the terminal had been returned to stock with their supplier igenicoafter much more wasted phone time i eventually got them to collect the terminal on january th following collection which i got signed for i again contacted martin to demand an immediate refund as their terminal was now in the hands of their courier no i’d have to wait until it was back in stocktoday january th i again phoned them and wasted yet more of my time talking to another filipino lady who had no clue and no authority eventually after keeping me on hold for several minutes she passed me to her supervisor who told me that although igenico had verbally confirmed receipt of the terminal we couldn’t have our refund until they’d sent a written report we demanded that someone in authority call us backabout an hour later we were called by someone called giam orteg who claimed to be a supervisor he told us that ingenico hadn’t received the terminal because of bad weather we told him that either he or the previous female supervisor was lying to us we asked to be transferred to someone in management or for him to get someone in management to call us he claimed to be unable to do this eventually we got igenico’s number from himwe called igenico where a charming lady in logistics called jane was instantly able to tell us that yes they’d received the terminal but it was amongst others awaiting scanning back into stock we asked her to contact gp and confirm this fact which she didabout an hour later mr ortega rang to say that igenico had called and that gp would “make an exception in this case” and process the refund i asked how soon would the money be back in my account he told me it would take up to  days they intend to hold onto my money following their mistake for up to  daysto add insult to injury no apology has been made by gp for their mistake for their lies and misinformation or for the stress caused to us at what is already a difficult time by their appalling excuse for a customer servicemy advice to any small business looking for a card services

this was exactly i requested an explanation they responded that it was simply a pin entered debit transaction i informed them that this had not happened due to the fact we did not have that capability with my reader they responded that global had told them this was the issue upon requesting contact information for global i was told they would contact them instead of me i started researching every transaction in november and discovered  amex charges that equaled the amount debited and notified the rep of this my rep immediately responded that this was now a amex issue apparently when someone else does the work they and global should have done they are able to narrow the problem down to exactly what you discovered for them i was then informed that this was an amex initiated debit now i am informed i was not authorized to accept amex i then told them i had not experienced any problems with amex prior to or after that specific date the  transactions were done and i had “authorization numbers” for those  that were disputed  days later the funds were put back into my account if i had not put forth the effort to uncover this they were perfectly content with keeping my money and had no interest in helping me recover it they just made up lies thinking i was too dumb to know the differencein my opinion global payment systems is singlefocused on making a profit without any concerns for there customers i will leave them as soon as i locate a processor that at the very least has a favorable customer service reputation i advise everyone to avoid themreplywhat a scam they have i canceled them over three years ago now and i just received a charge on  i cannot believe that they still have access to my checking account still after three years after i contact them they tell me that it is because i didn’t return the terminal i owned the terminal outright before i even signed up with them she tells me sorry once it charged your stuck she sent me a copy of a contract that for one wasn’t even signed and second of all it wasn’t even the same contract that i signed yes i did find my copy after all what a scam they have going on for them i am still trying to get my money back so let me tell you if you terminate them make sure you block them from your checking account because they will help themselves anytime they want to even   years later globalcitadeleftinc bewarereplythis company is ripping consumer off overseas in spain and i’m sure other countries they are creating a default to charge in usd and add on a hefty service charge when consumers use their credit cards overseas this is significantly higher than the fees charged by credit cards for translating foreign currencies into usd the firm should be looked into by the consumer fraud agencies around the globe they are taking an additional  of all overseas transactions beyond what the credit card user would normally have to pay i would this is against tens of billions of dollars of spending so a huge amount of money please look into thisreplythis company charged our business twice a month with steady increases for  months after we faxed and verbally requested the services be terminated we chose to discontinue their services due to rapid increases in charges and due to those fees being charged twice a month the charges appeared as if different terminals were used the names beside the debits appear differently on our statements we were told the duplicated fees were being removed and the reason we were charged double fees is because we offer services and we sell parts therefore “we have two businesses in one building” huh we are the sole owners with one company name our business has been in this building for over thirty years but we have never heard of a policy such as that the duplicated fees began on the second statement we addressed immediately and we were told it would be corrected plus the charges would be removed it stopped a month then it restarted but the initial charges were never removed now more than a year later they are determined to stick with the old excuse for duplicate charges without refund in addition to those charges they will not reimburse us for and the  months they continued to withdraw fees for a nonactive closed account the rep claimed they never received the termination form we faxed iseptember  she added that “without seeing that form they’re not allowed to stop an automatic contract renewal really we initially signed up over the phone on that day we were told there were “no contract” terms regrettably we have been unable to find that form thus far though we remember signing and faxing the form it now stands as “he said she said” i plan to check with our phoneinternet company i told the representative i was curious about the double standards i’m curious how an account can be created over the phone with verbal permission but that can’t eliminate an account over the phone with an adamant request especially since she clearly remembers remembers my husband calling and speaking with her in  adamantly repeating that we no longer want their services she also admitted the account displayed no activity since september  we’re considering an attorneyreplyglobal payments inc is a horrible company do not sign up with merchant services for your credit card processing needs i signed up with them on a month to month base after

they requested the same information again and again after it had already been provided they sent sent multiple copies of letters we were never supposed to receive in the first place after  months the application is still ongoingthe are wholly incompetent and worst of all unaccountable they make a small percentage out of every transaction made by every business in their system and yet act like they are doing their customers favors by granting their servicesa disgrace — and part of a banking system that is fundamentally hopelessly flawedreplyi have a seasonal garden business in georgia and just started using global last april i was not told about all the hidden fees and i was not told that they had a seasonal program  in october  when or business started to slow down  the fees started to

from designated account manager account manager does not respond to or even acknowledge emails i have to call customer service and make a complaint which is passed through to supervisor who contacts and follows up with account manager mailing address of our busines was changed to an “unknown” and “unrelated” address where statements were sent for three months this to me represents a breach of privacy still trying to find out how our account mailing address could have been changed finally did my own internet search of address and found name of business where statements were being mailed in error also discount rate changed on past two statements although we have a  year contract and also charged for statement fee on last two statements which was waived on  year contract also other new fees have just appeared on last two statements which we have never been charged for beforereplyi have the exact same issue with global payments about sudden change of my business address to some unrelated address in september i called customer service to inquire who didauthorize the change they said they could not find any information or track down how the change happened based on my past experience with their call center reps i doubt that they are competent enough to correct my address it took them  min to ask verification questions to confirm my account one would think that they run high security control yet they don’t have record who made the change so i called my designated account manager the next day to make sure the correction was taken care of over a month later shocked to find out that the incorrect address still shows on my statement i called customer service and asked to speak with a supervisor or manager for complaints was put on hold for mins before i can talk to a “manager” wasted another min to answer his verification questionsstay away from this company it is not the cheapest and your time is far more valuablereplynever never go with global payment global

not a good result having to use another merchant service at the same time as these useless rip off merchants just so i don’t suffer downtime absurdreplyi am absolutely disgusted with global payments holding all funds for over a month because of a refund refund is  but you hold back  there is no excuse for this kind of business why is the interest not paid to the merchant for  days you hold money or longer our company does not receive the interest and all the customers terms are affected because of this when calls are made good luck getting someone who understands you who owns this company and how can they be allowed to operate in canadaas you can see no kind words for global dealing with them the past seven years has been a nightmarereplyi have dealt with global payments for  years i

i ran two charges through for the same amounts for the same client one exhibitor and one sponsor for the conference at nearly the same timei had to manually input each one so there was a time lag between i had tried one charge earlier than day for the total amount but it was denied–not due to insufficient credit on the card just some communication error over the webglobal payments got the money from bank of america for these two charges and then noticed the authorization number for each was the same these numbers are generated automatically and i have no way of influencing this gp tried to blame this on volusion but i have two separate order numbers and paperwork from volusion how the error occurred is not clearbut gp refused to give me the money out of i finally got them to admit some wildhair fear that should they give me the money bank of america which had already authorized the charges as my client had preauthorized the charge would later realize the two numbers were the same and demand the money back this despite verbal and written via email assurances from boa and my client to gp that this would not occurso today gp agreed to give me  of the fee and the client must wait at least two weeks to get the other  back needless to say the client is not keen on writing me a check for that  until they have it back on their cardgp had frozen a week’s worth of credit card transaction payments while “reviewing the matter” supposedly though that has been unfrozen yet i must still deal with getting the rest of the money out of the client i would not be surprised the

lost a few good customers because of them on one matter i spoke with  different agents and they all give me different information we left messages and never received callbacks even talking with supervisors didn’t help much if you are a small or medium company is not recommended to go with themreplydon’t use global payment solutions i was led to them by my xcharge processor and they totally screwed me over they totally are unresponsive to messages you cannot get hold of an actual person without waiting on the line for  min or more mostly you have to leave a message when you actually get through to the person supposed to help you then in my case they double credited an k mistake to the buyer who was trying to make an end of year pmt on her cc then tried to double debit my account when i stopped the double debit they kept debteding my acct for small amts which totally sent my checking acct out of balance they are incompetent and once again i want to repeat that when you do have a problem at years of using them you cannot get hold of a real person to help you ripoffreplyafter having a nightmare experience with a different provider i ran into a similar situation with global –

a lover of horses their cabased bank found no evidence russian fraud clients were never shown proof of any of this they cancelled their cc transaction and paid us cash we met them and know them to be good people the way globalpay dealt with us the clients and the entire issue couldn’t have been less transparent we received absolutely nothing in writing from them about this alleged  fraudulent transaction gp doubted everything we told them about our interaction with the clientgp’s ineptitude has now been shown to be even worse than this last episode same clients new cc – globalpay has been holding a  transaction for  days now and rudely and poorly placating us – again nothing in writing no consideration of the fact that the clients are honest people who have received the materials we will build on their site no return calls and of course worst of all we lack this cash that we need for working capital they are deaf to this issue the client’s credit card is new and good – even the client’s bank vouched for the card and client still no deposit of funds into our accountwe will be switching processors as soon as this is resolved we are lucky not to have lost the client through all
