benefits from higher interest ratescompanies include first defiance financial corp fdef and many morein the following excerpt from the southeast  midwestern banks report donald p hileman ceo of first defiance financial corp fdef discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital sectortwst what is the competitive landscape given the enormity of the too big to fail the universal bank many of whom despite lacking a personal touch are bigger than ever does familiarity and direct interaction with the customer still rank as a competitive advantagemr hileman i think it does i think we still strongly believe in the premise that a community banking philosophy matters but were not just commoditizing all of our products and services there is a benefit from being able to if you so desire come in and talk to somebody and have that personal relationship with your bank and your banker and we think thats important and it gives us somewhat of a competitive edge over just having everything commoditizing universal bank if you willnow with that being said were expanding our ability for alternative delivery of our products and services to try to meet to the clients that have different needs some of our clients want the products and services that they need with a lowtouch delivery service some with higher touch so were looking to at our level try to service both sides of the needs of the customers from high touch and low touch i think we can do thattwst in your last earnings call there were several bright spots and aside from an adjustment here and there particularly within this new regulatory environment there were many positives please share with us some of the highlights from your most recent earnings release what has changed compared to the previous two years and
