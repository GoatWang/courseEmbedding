entirety of rightside group ltds gtld registry news provided by donuts inc jun    et share this article bellevue wash june   prnewswire  donuts inc the worlds largest operator of new domain name extensions today publicly announced its interest in acquiring rightside group ltds entire registry of generic toplevel domains gtlds also known as domain extensions and related assets for  million in an allcash deal donuts believes that this potential transaction presents a strong strategic opportunity to bolster donuts industryleading gtld portfolio and is compelling for rightside and its investors donuts previously expressed its interest to rightside relating to a potential acquisition for these assets but rightside has repeatedly disregarded the offer this move is in keeping with donuts stated strategy of expanding its selection of notcom domain extensions such as movie ltd agency email school group and many more each providing a more descriptive and creative means for big brands entrepreneurs and dreamers alike to brand their businesses products and services donuts already leads the industry having secured  domain extensions and is best positioned to market these assets by driving industry consolidation donuts acquisition of rightsides registry business – a win for all parties separating rightsides registry and registrar businesses is the best approach to unlocking value in both businesses providing rightside with substantial capital for investor liquidity and the optionality to invest in and grow its core registrar businesses the proposed acquisition complements donuts current portfolio and expands the range of domains and related services that donuts can offer further enhancing what is already the greatest portfolio of domain extensions donuts is the optimal acquirer for rightsides registry business given donuts leadership in the marketplace the parties longstanding business relationship our shared technology platform and regulatory considerations all of which ensure the highest certainty of deal closure about donuts donuts securely operates the largest number of the internets toplevel domain names and provides varied and relevant online identities in multiple languages and character sets to businesses individuals and organizations worldwide donuts is headquartered in bellevue washington with offices in los angeles chicago washington dc and london for more information please visit wwwdonutsdomains forward looking statement certain statements in this press release are forwardlooking statements words indicating future events performance results and actions such as will and believe and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forwardlooking the forwardlooking statements in this press release include among others statements regarding interactions with and actions relating to investors and execution of business strategies  forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future actions events or performance which may vary materially from those expressed or implied in such statements  letter to rightside regarding registry transaction the text of a letter sent to the chief executive officer of rightside on june   rightside group ltdboard of directorsco taryn naidu  lake washington blvd ne suite kirkland wa  dear taryn following due consideration we have concluded that it is in the best interest of both donuts inc donuts and the investors of rightside group ltd rightside that donuts should publicly present our interest in acquiring rightsides entire generic toplevel domain gtld portfolio and related assets the transaction to date we have expressed our interest in the transaction in a may   letter to rightsides board of directors and have spoken to you and another member of rightsides board of directors directly but have been repeatedly denied a broader conversation with your board our proposal represents an undeniably compelling case for all parties involved for donuts rightsides collection of gtlds complements donuts current business and expands the range of domains and related services we can offer bolstering what is already the greatest range of notcom options and economies of scale in the registry market today for rightside and its investors separating rightsides registry and registrar businesses would unlock substantial value for both businesses by among other things allowing each to focus on their strengths and avoiding channel conflict we firmly believe that donuts offers rightside a differentiated ability to consummate the transaction in an efficient manner and with an exceptionally high level of certainty we note that our allcash offer of  million represents approximately  of rightsides current market capitalization to acquire assets that contribute approximately  of its revenue we believe strongly in the value of those assets which we trust will appreciate substantially in donuts consolidated portfolio and business model but we have an equal amount of conviction that rightsides registry portfolios full value will go unrealized as long as it remains conjoined to your registrar businesses correspondingly we believe the valuation of rightsides registrar businesses are also constrained under your current operating model a separation of the registry and registrar assets will unlock stockholder value and allow you to focus on your core business which is generating approximately  million in annual sales we believe rightside would do best for its stockholders to acknowledge that our case is sound and work with us to enter into the transaction the overwhelming evidence validates the transactions merits enterprises of your size operating both registry and registrar businesses under vertically integrated models have poor track records of performance due to among other things inherent and inimical channel and supplier conflicts for example rightside earns approximately  of its registrys revenue from just one of its registrars competitors godaddy inc and pays approximately  of your registrars revenue to just one of your registrys competitors verisign inc rightsides recent performance and the similar struggles minds  machines group limited encountered while employing the same basic model underscore the problems with vertical integration in this space rightside and its investors should note the improved financial performance that minds  machines has enjoyed following abandonment of that model in favor of operating as a pureplay business we remain convinced that this is a deal that represents the best possible outcome for all involved unfortunately the merits of our proposal have not to date been appropriately discussed or considered donuts is the leader in the new gtld industry we fully understand the business we seek to acquire and we believe we can offer unrivaled certainty and efficiency to consummate the proposed transaction due to among other things our geographic proximity and the shared dna between our two companies we trust that you will give this proposal the full consideration it deserves and seek the counsel of your investors in doing so time remains of the essence while this  million proposal is nonbinding donuts has the cash to consummate the transaction but is considering other strategic objectives in parallel therefore we look forward to discussing this opportunity for mutual benefit with you and your board within two weeks very truly yours paul stahura cc
