on health care email listen httpdifhelvtcloudfrontnetnewshourrssmediasecuritympsee podcasts jim lehrer president obama presents a revamped national security team the shuffle has been in the works for some time and today the president made it official in the white house east room president barack obama i have worked closely with most of the individuals on this stage and all of them have my complete confidence they are leaders of enormous integrity and talent who’ve devoted their lives to keeping our nation strong and secure and i am personally very very grateful to each of them for accepting these new assignments jim lehrer today’s announcement was triggered by secretary of defense robert gates a holdover from the bush administration he told the president last year he wanted to step down this summer and has now fixed his departure for june  cia director leon panetta was the president’s choice today to succeed gates at the pentagon panetta would be the oldest person to become secretary of defense at  years old he’s served in government for decades as budget director and white house chief of staff in the clinton administration and before that as a longtime democratic congressman from california leon panetta cia director as the son of immigrants i was raised to believe that we cannot be free unless we are secure today we are a nation at war yet this is also a time for hard choices it’s about ensuring that we are able to prevail in the conflicts in which we are now engaged but it’s also about being able to be strong and disciplined in applying our nation’s limited resources to defending america jim lehrer the nominee to replace panetta at the cia army gen david petraeus the general is now overall commander of the international security assistance forces in afghanistan prior to that he ran the us central command and he oversaw coalition forces in iraq during the surge of us troops there gen david petraeus international security assistance force i’ve had the privilege of working very closely with the quiet professionals of the central intelligence agency i have seen firsthand their expertise their commitment to our nation and their courage in dangerous circumstances their service to our country is of vital importance jim lehrer the president wants us marine lt gen john allen to take over in afghanistan allen is petraeus’ former deputy at centcom he joined the marine corps in  as a commissioned officer after graduating from the us naval academy lt gen john allen international security assistance force i understand well the demands of this mission and mr president if confirmed by the senate i will dedicate my full measure to the successful accomplishment of the tasks and the objectives now set before us jim lehrer gen allen would be joined in afghanistan by a new us ambassador taking the place of karl eikenberry who’s expected to leave shortly ryan crocker is being nominated for the posting in kabul crocker is a career diplomat who retired from the state department after serving as us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker us ambassador to afghanistandesignate the challenges are formidable and the stakes are high  came to us out of afghanistan our enemy must never again have that opportunity jim lehrer the personnel changes come as us forces in afghanistan are set to begin pulling out in july but recent incidents won’t make that any easier yesterday an afghan pilot shot and killed eight american soldiers and a us contractor at the kabul airport it was the seventh such attack this year on monday more than  prisoners mostly taliban escaped from a prison in kandahar after digging a footlong tunnel and there are reports that pakistan is pressing afghan president karzai to scale back his country’s reliance on the us those challenges and others will confront the president’s new team once they clear senate confirmation white house officials indicate they hope to have panetta in place at the pentagon by july  and generals petraeus and allen in their new positions by september some analysis now from jessica tuchman mathews president of the carnegie endowment for international peace she served in the carter and clinton administrations john mclaughlin former cia deputy director and then acting director he now teaches at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies and army gen jack keane army vice chief of staff from  to  he now has his own consulting firm first just in general general what do you think of the new team gen jack keane ret us army well they’re good choices they’re very capable and i think it says a lot about continuity three of them are already serving in national security and they have got a lot of experience with it and we’re bringing ryan crocker back into government absolutely one of the most accomplished diplomats operating in this region we’ve ever had so it’s — they have made all solid choices jim lehrer all solid choices jessica tuchman mathews carnegie endowment for international peace oh yes and individual ability continuity ability to deal with congress i think and ability to sell the plan in afghanistan those were — that’s what they were looking for here jim lehrer what do you see john mclaughlin former acting cia director yes very much so i can’t think of anyone more prepared to step in behind bob gates than leon panetta and at cia there is always a little anxiety when a popular respected director like leon panetta leaves but i’m confident they will embrace gen petraeus jim lehrer jessica jessica mathews what about the idea that — though that there is no new face here it is continuity and is continuity always a good thing when you don’t have any fresh faces any fresh thinking that comes with it jessica tuchman mathews well i would say that the flip side of continuity is fresh ideas and if — if you develop a sense in an administration that only insiders can see what they are doing can understand it can execute it then i think pretty soon you get a — sort of a feeling of circling the wagons both the perception of it and the reality of it and that’s a — that’s a weakness that every administration has to guard against so i think there is a cost to always and only looking inside jim lehrer do you agree john mclaughlin well i see it a little differently i think the world itself today guarantees that there is no continuity so in other words whatever team is there — and these are all qualified proven people — they are going to have to deal with turmoil in the world and transition so there is no plan someone can put on the table and say we’re going to follow that ceaselessly and without any change over the next period of time so… jim lehrer but nobody should expect any dramatic differences with the total — what the team itself has been doing and what the new team will do correct gen jack keane well that’s correct in terms of what is in front of them jim lehrer policy and stuff yes gen jack keane sure but i mean listen we deal with strategic surprise continuously we just had it again with the revolutions that are taking place in the middle east most people did not have that on their charter so having experienced capable professions that have been through crisis before i think bodes well here to deal with it my only reservation about all of this is taking petraeus away from afghanistan at this critical time while we’re trying to change the momentum in that war and how much he means to that that is my single reservation with it jim lehrer and he would be replaced by gen allen you have some questions about allen or just — just leaving petraeus… gen jack keane no no questions about allen allen is overseeing that war from centcom he is gen david petraeus’s recommendation he has got a tremendous reputation himself it’s just that this is a very critical time and let’s be frank about it i mean petraeus is the best we’ve got and we’re right in the middle of turning this war around jim lehrer and the same thing has been said about bob gates the secretary of defense that he’s going to be very tough to replace by anybody even leon panetta do you agree jessica tuchman mathews i do and i have a slightly different view i think than john did about panetta obviously nobody comes close to him in washington experience at both ends of pennsylvania avenue on the hill and in the white house as chief of staff and he knows budgetcutting but he doesn’t know defense per se right and you know coming in not knowing the culture of that building and the substance of the thousands of issues that he has to deal with is to come in i think with one hand tied behind your back it’s — it’s – you’ve got two wars you have got huge a budget cut coming in the pentagon issues of — i mean cuts of bone and of fat are all tangled up you can — there is plenty of waste jim lehrer and machines as well jessica tuchman mathews but you have to have a vision of what kind of military you are trying to build in order to get the cuts to make sense and he’s coming in really without experience on those issues so i think there’s a real challenge there jim lehrer speaking as a military man how do you see that is panetta really the man to run the department of defense gen jack keane well first of all gates is really tough shoes to fill jessica tuchman mathews yes gen jack keane he’s one of the most effective secretaries we have ever had so that would be tough no matter who you are picking but what i like about this is look panetta has got a real solid reputation for good judgment common sense works well with people listens to people at the same time he’s been on this national security team listening to all the policy formulation and development that’s been taking place so his knowledge is very high coming in even though he specifically doesn’t know how those departments are running i think his spinup will be pretty quick jim lehrer sure john mclaughlin … because i think one of the things we have to remember here is that the cia since  has been essentially a warfighting machine and so leon panetta by virtue of his time there has been very close to the military and there’s no closer relationship by necessity in washington — or should be — than between the cia director and the secretary of defense jim lehrer do they get along did gates and panetta gates as secretary of defense and panetta as head of the cia did they work well together play well together as they say john mclaughlin absolutely very closely together before they came to office they knew each other well and after coming to office they were very close jim lehrer now correct me if i’m wrong but the general consensus was that when panetta became head of the cia some of the folks in the agency doubted whether or not he was qualified to come in and he was looked upon as somebody a politician who had come in and may not be the right person he did — did he in fact win over the troops of the cia john mclaughlin he did very much so there’s a bit of a myth that the cia will not embrace an outsider they will if it’s someone who is as respected and connected and savvy as leon panetta but to be fair i mean he didn’t know a lot about intelligence when he came he was a very quick study and he did the thing that a cia director has to do in order to succeed and that was he listened and he didn’t bring a lot of people with him he brought in one person with him he came in… jim lehrer one outside person with him john mclaughlin only one person came with him his chief of staff jim lehrer everybody else that is under him at the cia now are people who were already in office john mclaughlin yes jim lehrer is that unusual john mclaughlin it is unusual and — but it sends a message to the troops there that this is a person who is going to rely on them look to them show them a lot of respect you know the cia is always in the midst of controversy so they are always looking for someone who can defend them stick up for them and he’s done that and he’s learned his brief very well so… jim lehrer what do you think about turning the cia over to a military man petraeus jessica tuchman mathews i think there’s an issue there as well you know the vast majority of our  intelligence agencies are military are within the pentagon chain of command they are inside it the cia is the leading policymaking intelligence — or policyinvolved intelligence agency and the one whose charter has got to be most political dealing with a lot of issues that are not militaryrelated not tactical and not warfightingrelated i think as a trend it’s probably not a healthy one if in addition to all the other military intelligence agencies we end up with the cia being more and more led by military this — an awful lot of issues that the cia needs to be smart about that are outside of the military purview… jim lehrer and out of what you would consider petraeus’ experience up until now jessica tuchman mathews certainly jim lehrer do you agree general gen jack keane well i think running the central intelligence agency the military should be exception not the norm and i think in this case the exception is probably understandable i mean gen petraeus has been involved in two wars intimately involved with dealing with the central intelligence agency and some of the absolute handsdown best professionals that they have are operating in this region i think his attraction to the agency — not speaking for him but just knowing him pretty well — is two things one as john clearly pointed out the agency’s fighting a covert clandestine war against radical islam and alqaida and gen petraeus has been involved in that himself he gets the opportunity to continue that and bring some of his unique skill sets to that and also it contributes to policy formulation and i know gen petraeus has strategic interests in doing that as well jessica tuchman mathews i think it’s worth just mentioning… jim lehrer sure jessica tuchman mathews … that in this context that three of the four directors of national intelligence have been military men and these are the boss of the head of the cia so there is a — there is a — something… john mclaughlin i have got nothing — i have got nothing against civilian leadership at cia but at the same time i would say over time since  we have had seven military officers as heads of the cia and many of them have done quite well gen bedell smith in the early years and gen mike hayden more recently something i would say to people at cia right now about this general is this is a general who is a soldierscholar he’s got a phd from princeton and so he’s able to move in many different worlds and i would see him being very comfortable on both the analytic and the operational side of the agency jim lehrer finally why did they bring back ryan crocker do you think jessica tuchman mathews you can’t do better jim lehrer no you really can’t do better jessica tuchman mathews i don’t think so i mean he’s been ambassador he’s had the experience in iraq he’s been ambassador in pakistan jim lehrer but none in afghanistan but none in afghanistan jessica tuchman mathews he’s been ambassador in pakistan jim lehrer ok jessica tuchman mathews that is really more important than kabul and — for the outcome in afghanistan and he’s been all over the region he has the language skills he has everybody’s respect for how he has delivered jim lehrer do you wonder why he took the job jessica tuchman mathews yes laughter jessica tuchman mathews i think… jim lehrer it’s really a tough job jessica tuchman mathews you know i think — i said at the outset i thought delivery of the message about the policy was very much on their minds in these appointments but my guess is — and i don’t know — that he finally agreed to do this because of how serious he thinks the situation there is jim lehrer quick word from you about crocker what do you think about crocker gen jack keane oh i think he was indispensable to turning the situation around in iraq he’s absolute handsdown the finest diplomat i have seen in an operational setting where everything is on the line he works so well with the military the civilmilitary relationship that he had with petraeus is the best i have ever observed and there’s no doubt that will continue initially with petraeus here and also with general allen jim lehrer you feel good about crocker too john mclaughlin yes i have worked with him in the past and he among other things is a superb leader of an embassy mission everyone in the mission feels like part of a team when he’s in charge jim lehrer ok all right thank you all very much all three share on facebook share on twitter share via text barack obama cia david

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples
