helppo ja huomaamaton tapa seurata mahdollista pesinnän aloittamista ja kotkan pesään asettumista kamerat eivät häiritse kotkaa sähköpostiin välittyvien kuvien perusteella voidaan seurata asettuuko

väliaikaista pitkospuupolkua pitkin yhtiö päätti vähentää alueelle kulkemisesta koituvaa maapohjan kulumista ja aloitti yhteistyön paikallisen hevosenomistajan kanssa hevonen kantaa kerralla  kertaa sen mitä yksi mies toteaa hevosten ensimmäisenä työpäivänä paikalla ollut malminetsintägeologi janne kinnunen hevosen kulkeminen on myös huomattavasti nopeampaa kuin ihmisen lukumäärältään vähäisemmät ja kestoltaan nopeammat käyntikerrat vähentävät myös esimerkiksi eläinlajeille aiheutuvaa häiriötä toteaa yhtiön ympäristöpäällikkö noora raasakka hevonen kuljettaa kerran pari viikossa tarvittavia
