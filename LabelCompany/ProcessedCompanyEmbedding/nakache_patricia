university how did you decide to become a venture capitalist my path to venture capital was serendipitous so i advise young people to plan their careers but also be open to interesting but perhaps orthogonal opportunities when they present themselves in  i had recently left mckinsey  company to join the dotcom revolution and was working as director of marketing at a startup on the side for fun i was writing freelance for fortune magazine about some of the innovative approaches to management being pioneered by exciting silicon valley tech companies for my reporting i spoke to many venture capitalists and hit it off with the trinity team they asked me to join them and i was immediately enthralled by the caliber of entrepreneurs i had the good fortune to meet and their new business ideas and here i am  years later still loving every day what is the most rewarding aspect of your job without a doubt the greatest rewards come from supporting the amazing feats and successes of our entrepreneurs i particularly love the pivotal moment when my portfolio companies achieve product market fit and can turn their attention to scaling entrepreneurs defy the odds at every turn with almost superhuman effort and intensity and i strive to be the best supporting actress leveraging my experience and relationships to help them realize their dreams what about trinity ventures makes you proudest and why trinity has an unbeatable culture it’s built on fairness trust and intellectual honesty it embraces diversity and it requires everyone to check their egos at the door we have deep respect for our entrepreneurs and limited partners and our approach to solving problems is highly collaborative our culture is truly the bedrock for the longevity and success of our firm and it makes

valley has some surprising solutions to eliminate gender bias for startups photo pressmaster via shutterstockby lydia dishman minute readpatricia nakache is a rarity in silicon valleyadvertisementshe’s a female venture capitalist and partner with the firm trinity ventures where she’s funded online consumer and business service companies since  according to research from babson college’s diana project nakache is among a dying breed a recent survey found that the total number of female partners at vc firms declined from  to  in the  years since nakache started at trinity ventures patricia nakachephoto via trinity venturesduring her tenure nakache has taken an active role to steward female entrepreneurs of portfolio companies through the growth of their businesses sheila marcelo took carecom to ipo on nakache’s watch while ilana stern’s weddington way and anna zornosa’s ruby ribbon are among other femaledriven womenfocused companies nakache is investing in and advisingour industry with its insatiable appetite for ideas that will ‘change the world’ is stuck in a traditional paradigm that does a regrettable disservice to the industry it claims to supportthanks to this frontrow seat to the evolution of technology businesses that aim to disrupt their respective industries nakache has seen the equally powerful opposing force of sexism persist she wrote in techcrunch “there is an ironic philosophical gap between the creative idealism of the startup industry and the investors who fund them our industry with its insatiable appetite for ideas that will ‘change the world’ is stuck in a traditional paradigm that does a regrettable disservice to the industry it claims to support”nakache talked to fast company in depth about her observations and what can be done to encourage more female entrepreneurs here’s what she had to sayrecognize bias is everywherebeyond gender discrimination nakache is convinced that we all–men and women–suffer from unconscious biases including age and background “there is a litany of attributes” says nakache that are at play when a founder is being sized up for funding “the root of it is this notion of pattern recognition” nakache explains venture capitalists make decisions based on similarities does the presenting ceo or the business opportunity have traits that resemble a previous successful ventureif they see something familiar from their past nakache argues they are more likely to be receptive conversely “it’s harder to see when the person or opportunity is unfamiliar” she says no wonder nakache says that one male vc famously said the most successful startups are led by young single men in their s “that is driven by their particular pattern” she saysadvertisementcompanies with a female ceo only received  of the total venture capital dollarsthe babson study bears this out in terms of women investing in women too companies with a female ceo only received  of the total venture capital dollars or  billion out of the total of  billion invested during  yet  of venture capital firms with female partners invested in companies with women as ceos as opposed to  of firms without women partnersfind a partnerso should women founders team up with men in order increase their chances of getting funding“that’s very perceptive” nakache admits but that young single dude doesn’t necessarily even need to be in the room when the pitch is made nakache believes that recruiting team members or advisers who have particular skills the female founder lacks or who are respected and viewed as successful by an established vc can be very helpful nakache explains it’s like an endorsement “this person was willing to sign up because they saw something so i should look closely” nakache is quick to add that would be even true for a young male founder who is just starting out partnering with “someone who is a proven commodity” could remove doubts about the inexperienced entrepreneurnakache says that despite men’s reputation for aggressively taking charge of presentations she’s not seen the women in her portfolio companies be shrinking violets “at the end of the day whoever on the team embodies the mission they are the natural leader” she says then nakache says it is important that the entire founding team “live and breathe the mission”advertisementbe a team playeranother key element in building a successful startup also tackles the gender question nakache says in order to start building a highperforming team founders need to be unafraid to hire people who have more domain expertise for both men and women she says this can help a founder see past their own blind spots“the most successful female entrepreneurs are recruiting buyin to their mission and culture” she saysget a coachthe other key trait of successful entrepreneurs nakache has observed is that they have laserlike focus on productmarket fit “are you building something people actually want” she positsilana stern found this out through multiple iterations of her ecommerce platform weddington way nakache says and achieved it through relentless analysis of the data to figure out how to get bridal parties to engage on the sitenakache has observed that female entrepreneurs engage executive coaches more frequently than their male counterparts anna zornosa from ruby ribbon is one who retained a coach before she even launched her business notes nakache “it says i am investing in myself because i’m not perfect and want to be better at what i do” nakache saysthis was helpful in the early stages of ruby ribbon she says when zornosa had to deal with a problematic consultant it’s painful when the team is small nakache concedes “through coaching she was able to get the fortitude to make a change” says nakacheadvertisementjoin leadership editor kathleen davis with anu duggal the founder of fcubed female founders fund and kathryn
