address got it got it by david bernstein by david bernstein february   thomas c leonard with whom i coauthored an article several  years ago has a new book out “illiberal reformers race eugenics  american economics in the progressive era” the book won’t be news to those who have been following tim’s copious writings but it may come as a shock to those who think that one can draw a straight line from prenew deal progressivism to the liberal “rights revolution” of the postworld war ii era as leonard’s title suggests as a rule early progressives were far from liberal in the broad sense of the word instead combining a belief in eugenics and trendy pseudoscience a distrust of markets a disavowal of the american natural rights tradition and a broad faith in the power of government to shape society for good they sought public policies that would benefit “fit” white male breadwinners of northern european origin and their families at the expense of “unfit” african americans eastern and southern europeans women and northern european men with physical or mental disabilities thus for example rather than disputing the notion that minimum wage laws would lead to the exclusion of the latter groups from the labor market progressive reformers thought that this was a strong point in favor of such laws moreover as this favorable book review in the new republic acknowledges “in the early twentieth century progressives displayed an open contempt for individual rights” leonard’s book focuses on economists while my own book “rehabilitating lochner protecting individual rights from progressive reform” discusses similar intellectual trends in the legal profession albeit in the broader context of the development of constitutional law we should not blame modern liberalsprogressives for the sins of the original progressives we should instead recognize that modern legal liberalism is an amalgam of progressive ideas eg nearabsolute judicial deference to economic regulation classical liberal ideas eg fundamental rights that trump even valid police power interventions by government and a dash of labor and other forms of radicalism eg the influence of the aclu founded and led by roger baldwin who by  was effusively praising workers’ liberty in stalin’s ussr on the development of civil liberties doctrines update to be clear the aclu eventually became an important part of the mainstream liberal establishment but in its early years when modern rightsbased liberalism was first emerging on the supreme court it was a radicalleft organization in addition to the new
