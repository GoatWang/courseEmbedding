from a forthcoming book “adizes in practice” to be published by adizesinstitute in  dr ichak adizes we are interviewing today a very dear friend a client of the past dan maydan who was a former president of applied materials a very large and successful company at the time that he retired it was a company that brought in more than  billion dollars in revenue hello dan how are you dan maydan i’m fine how are you ichak ichak adizes  i’m very good i’m in moscow and understand you are in silicon valley the recording is in arizona and the audience world wide in real time  modern life dan maydan yes ichak adizes when you joined applied materials how large was the organization dan maydan when i joined applied materials which was in september  the company was doing somewhere between  to  million dollars revenue though at the time it was coming down it had had some difficulties and in  james morgan was called to the company to try to see what could be done he solved most of the problems and then in  i and my group which formed in new jersey joined the company ichak adizes  you joined in  i don’t know which year i joined  all i know is that james morgan who at the time was the ceo of the company and also chairman of the board heard my lectures in japan and came to me after the lecture and said “dr adizes we are a  million dollars company we aim to be a billion dollars company can you help us” when was the company  million  i have no recall of the time dan maydan just to talk about it brings back memories j morgan came to me one time and told me “have you heard about this guy adizes” i said “no” then i heard that you were consulting with a company in israel so i went to israel to ask about you and then we hired you after i came back and that was i think around  or so if i’m not mistaken ichak adizes it was a  million dollar company then when you left i left with you it was  billion dollars  billion right … dan maydan no it was between  to  billion dollars ichack adizes right still a pretty big growth the company invited me to help it grow to  billion and we ended up with  billion i think the company who interviewed you and asked for references in israel was elbit i’m interviewing emmanuel gill who was then the president of elbit next week dan maydan oh yes i had just spoken to him about you at that time ichak adizes dan tell us what made applied so successful to go from  million dollars all the way to  billion dollars and become the world leader in semiconductor equipment dan maydan well when we joined the company it was coming down fast i mean pretty fast and that had to be reversed so we created a totally different environment and introduced innovation and commercialization the company needed to continuously innovate to come up with new products and a new methodology and organization which could support different strategies of operation we made sure that every two years or so we would introduce a new product every four years we would come up with a new market segment so we kept growing continuously for over  years on an average of somewhere between  to  percent a year ichak adizes it was really innovation that was at the heart of the rise the entrepreneurship the e component the audience that is listening here knows about paei so you’re welcome to use the paei code in your answers but i think that it was not just individualized e tell me if you agree with me or not you are very much an e person and there is no question you provided a lot of entrepreneurial ideas and leadership to the company but you also brought with you a capability that you had which was to imprint this entrepreneurship in the whole company e was not dependent only on you dan maydan you are absolutely correct as you say your methodology of paei and “e” always on top of each unit was central to get that to work it is very important for a growing company to decentralize and to get people who are able to perform better than you so you have sufficient time to talk to employees to talk to customers and understand the company even better then you concentrate on the strategy while understanding every detail that is occurring on a daily basis so the innovation and commercialization are very important concepts but innovation by itself is certainly insufficient and i experienced that at bell labs where i was for many years you also need commercialization if you want to be in hightech which we were so using the organizational structure which you helped us establish we achieved that it was important to understand that every organization has green units as you define it  green as the source of the profits led by an e and to recruit people who were better than me and if you have these kinds of people in a correct organizational structure and you rely on them you don’t micromanage them then the company will usually do well ichak adizes i want to tell the audience something about dan i lecture all over the world and in all my lectures i mention your name dan and give you credit for what i’ve learned from you in adizes we do not only teach but also learn from our clients i would like to share that with our audience when dan retired i was invited to come to the retirement party and i noticed something very very interesting when he retired a lot of the people that were under him were let go or they left because a new president who came from the outside had his own ideas about who the top management should be and all those managers who had reported to dan left but became ceos of their own companies and here is how it happened here is dan president of the  billion dollars company and whenever i would call dan and i would ask “dan can i see you” he would say “sure come in” now that’s very surprising because any other company of that size when i call the president he would say “well we can see each other next week for half an hour” and then they would have a hell of a tough time giving me the time their allprecious time but dan said “sure come in” well i thought maybe because i’m his consultant he gives me preference with time then i realized that any vice president if they called him he would say “come in” where does a president of an  billion dollars company have time how can it be so i asked him “can i look at your calendar” i looked at the calendar most of it was empty a meeting here and a meeting there but most of it empty how does he do that and dan at the retirement party told me where he learned how to do it at bell lab your first boss at bell lab taught you this it was very interesting how you made a science out of it when somebody would come to dan the president with a problem and would say “dan here is my problem what should i do” dan would get upset he would say”you are a manager you are an executive you should have a solution don’t just give me the problem what’s your solution” if the guy didn’t have a solution dan would send him out and say “come back with a solution” when the guy came with a solution if dan did not like it dan would not tell him what to do rather he would ask” did you think about this or that go back and redo your solution” he constantly put all the work on his subordinates they had to think it through until they came up with a solution he could accept and then he would say “very good solution go ahead and do it” now that is totally different from what executives usually do executives often get it wrong a person comes with a problem the executive gives the solution and then the executive spends a lot of time supervising that the solution is just the way he wants it to be done they work very hard in the case of dan he makes his subordinates work very hard they have to come up with a solution that he can accept and he always tells them what’s missing so that they can redo the solution as a result all his subordinates developed qualities that make for an excellent ceo and not surprisingly they all became ceo’s of their own companies and he himself had a lot of time available on his hands because he did not have to solve problems they did and since he approved their decisions they felt obliged and committed to do the best they can do and needed much less supervision perfect time management… so dan how did you learn to do this how did you learn to make the people come up with the solutions rather than you providing it how did you control your ego not to aim to be smarter than anybody else dan maydan i don’t know how i controlled my ego but i think a lot it came from the culture at bell telephone laboratories which was the center of innovation and created the wealth of the i would say of the th century not just in the united states but worldwide if you get bright people you want to challenge them and unless you challenge them they will not be able to produce and you don’t want them to just follow your orders you have to manage the environment that they themself are part of they are the creators of new things so they need to be supervised in a fashion that just suggests to them whether they are going in the right or the wrong direction so this is methodology is all very natural and i adopted it many of the people reported doing the same thing so we never micromanaged we challenged employees continuously not just vice presidents but all levels i didn’t allow reviews that were technical except financial i didn’t allow people to come with written out explanations because i wanted to know exactly their thinking i let them talk freely and openly and then there was a discussion and at the end many times i had to make a decision one way or another but it was the thought of the people around us that we wanted to hear  i wanted them to offer suggestions which the individual responsible either accepted or rejected  and that really creates a totally different kind of environment we did it within the company and we also did it with the customer because after all what you sell to a customer is the dream which you need to deliver two or three years later because what you develop today will only be used by the customers two to four years from now and therefore while listening to his needs you need to understand what he’ll really need two years from now and you try to sell him that particular kind of a dream but you always need to deliver and that kind of message needs to penetrate every single employee in the company from the technical to the financial operations and sales organization and in fact at all levels from top managers to the lowestlevel employee we all understood the charter and what our job was in the company ichak adizes i would really like here to emphasize what dan has just said and that is i call it the terrorism of the powerpoint companies are really becoming addicted to powerpoint presentations meetings lights are low and then the power point presentations go one after the other very few people are watching some people are looking at their ipads or iphones or blackberries there is no discussion one question here one question there boring no thinking no discussion presentation is over meeting is over nothing happened dan would never allow that to happen let me describe to you a meeting that dan handled at the beginning i was really surprised because at the meeting—executive committee—here is dan maydan whom we are interviewing right now he is the president of the  billion dollars company an executive committee meeting is taking place that he chairs i was a consultant and watching and dan is kind of sitting very quietly here he is the chairman he is the president of the company but doesn’t say a word a discussion is taking place still doesn’t say a word i started to wonder is he tired of the job or what why is he so quiet he doesn’t say a word then i realized what he was doing as long as the discussion is going in the right direction he does not “push the river”  he lets everyone discuss and he will always encourage discussion and exchange if the group is starting to go in the wrong direction for some reason he will jump in and say “hey guys have you looked at this have you looked at that” and let them continue the discussion he was creating a learning environment an exchange of ideas and learning rather than a presentation where people are glued to the screen and just ask a question here and a there i really want to applaud you dan for establishing an incredible culture at applied materials that enabled the company to grow from  million dollars and going down and reverse its direction to  billion and going up and then you retired i want to ask you a question which was interesting to me how you managed that when you retired the board hired somebody who was with a production orientation which means they brought in a p while the company needed to hire somebody from a hightech company he kicked all the e’s out and put all the pa’s in and the company went from  billion to i don’t know how far down an incredible number down and i was watching you you built that company you gave your heart and soul and brain for  years to build it from  million to  billion  and now the company was going down other people would have collapsed given up what happened what went through your mind after you retired and watched the company going down what went through your mind dan maydan of course it was saddening because i saw very quickly that many of the top employees were leaving the company people with capabilities were disappearing it became more or less an empty shell only kept going by momentum and giving an opportunity to competitors not just in the united states but elsewhere to penetrate the market to which we were the leader of course inertia kept the company going for some time however it didn’t stay the toptechnology company they lost the number one position in the industry to become number two it’s still number two it’s not what it used to be which is very sad  but you know life moves on and i’m sure that they are now in the process of recovery and hopefully they’ll come back to a leadership position ichak adizes doesn’t it hurt you dan … i would expect somebody else would bitch and moan and complain and really feel very depressed that they’re destroying the taj mahal that you built you took it in stride and you simply say life goes on how could you do that where did you get the strength to continue and just to kind of separate to let go of your dream let go of whatever you built how did you do that other executives especially founders of companies do not usually act so casually when somebody new comes in and starts destroying their creation they often wind up with a heart attack they get cancer and they die  you didn’t fall into the trap how come what really made you not fall into the trap dan maydan well i have a good friend a japanese man who told me “don’t look at it as retirement look at it as a second harvest” i really started my second harvest when i began involving myself with many new companies i’m involved with about eight different companies one was already sold one became public and it is a great challenge and in addition i’m involved with some non–profits like the technion which i’m a graduate of and that keeps me very busy and challenged on top of all that it is a great pleasure for me to see all my associates becoming ceos or very successful employees and executives of other companies i continuously meet them at least  percent of my time which is about three or four days a week i have lunch or dinner with previous employees and we talk not necessarily about the past but we talk about the present and the future of what should be done how can or should we do it so i’m continuously challenged and i feel very happy and satisfied about all that i feel extremely satisfied that many previous employees and it’s not just executives it goes down to the direction of managers i knew almost everybody at the company when they start new careers they usually call me and we meet and discuss their new role and if they listen to me it makes me feel very satisfied and happy so life … you know we only have one life and life must go on ichak adizes this is a help dan you seem to look at everything as if today is the first day of the rest of your life so you look at the present tense as a beginning of the future rather than a continuation of the past that gives you the capability to turn around and be with your face to the sun and move on and look at the new challenges and lead a productive life rather than lament the problems that happened in the past and mourn that what you built is being destroyed dan another question to you i was very impressed with your acumen in identifying talent what did you look for in people when you were bringing them to top positions you promoted a lot of people from below to the top dan maydan you know we gave opportunities at applied materials to people based on their talent not on their origins that’s why we had people from many different countries the only thing which i didn’t allow them was to speak their own language when they were at work they all had to speak english so that everybody else could understand them we had people from china from japan from england from korea from you name it spain brazil any country that you could imagine we had people working for us based only on their talent that again i learned at bell labs always take the best people you can find and don’t ever hesitate to take people who are better than you just give them the opportunities to excel ichak adizes how did you find good people what does it mean when you say “good people” how did you identify talent when you were looking at a particular person what were you looking for what impressed you dan maydan well that’s a very good question and it’s very difficult to describe first of all if i look for a technical person i am trying to find someone with a technical background when it is human resources or finance or whatever at least give them the opportunities to have experience in this area looking for technical people i took about  or more of the top students from the top  universities we kept them at the expense of the corporation for six months they went from one department or from one division to another including manufacturing and then the various divisions bid on them and they these people were very successful if a guy for example came and told us in an interview after asking him the question “what would you like to be five years from now or where would you like to be”  if the guy told us “oh i want to be in your position” then he lost it we’ll never take him but if the guy said “i want to be able to contribute to the best of my ability and create new things or create better things for the company” and if the background was proper if he had a good grade and showed promise a future he is a guy we hired so we were very careful in hiring people based on their talent not necessarily on their aspiration to become top general managers ichak adizes dan apropos hiring talent what was it that made you hire adizes when you interviewed emmanuel gill why did you decide to hire adizes what triggered you or what made you interested dan maydan well if you recall you came and gave a presentation and i thought it was very very impressive i mean the concept of paei that you need all four of the roles  and e is most important in high tech and you covered the concept of corporate lifecycle the concept of green that everything must lead like river into green profit center at the end…those were very unusual concepts which i felt were very important i felt the company was growing we were as you say a  million dollar company we were growing very very fast and we didn’t have any experience in how to run a company even though morgan started to hire good people who had expertise—like jerry taylor at that time in finance and jim bagley in operation—we still needed to create a culture that will enable us to grow to be a much larger corporation my dream was to reach  or even  billion dollars in revenues which i believe we could have done we needed to organize the whole thing together after all people make the organization and the organization gives the opportunity to people we needed to give these people this opportunity and i felt that you were the right guy to create or help us create this kind of organization which will give us all both the opportunity and the capability to reach our dream ichak adizes is there any specific event that you think contributed something really important to know about or it was really more of a total flow dan maydan  it was really a total flow because i felt the company was limited unless we did something and morgan felt the same and we really needed help to build a strong organization and thank you for providing it ichak adizes i would like to tell the audience what i really did with dan and dan’s leadership we actually restructured the company practically every two years or something like that as the company was growing it needed continuous restructuring a division that was  million in revenues became a billion dollars division  it’s like cells when they grow big they have to split and start all over again dan was never afraid to relook at the structure and then realign the structure and change the structure as the company was growing … i look at organization structure like they are pants of a little baby when a child puts the pants on the first time they look oversize but then after one year they become like underwear you continuously have to restructure the company which is growing very fast or the structure will stymie organizational growth and dan always allowed restructuring encouraged it  there was no fear in the company about restructuring and restructuring and restructuring so that the company could grow and not get stymied dan maydan let me comment on that you said one very important thing you see everything if it’s alive must change the only thing which doesn’t change is in the graveyard or everything that is dead  so we were all open to change and the change which we created you explained very carefully to us and i think that was a major issue is what kind of organization we should have decentralized or a centralized organization and we all felt due to your guidance decentralized would give us a much better opportunity to grow we didn’t even worry about two divisions competing with each other not on the same product but on products aimed for the same market so we allowed this kind of competition and every division was responsible for its own profit and loss they were autonomous and i think we had about seven of these divisions and we were entirely open to this kind of structure and i have recommended to every growing company to do the same because this is a very effective and in my view even essential way for growth ichak adizes i would like to emphasize something and thank you dan for pointing this out to me because you remind me of one of the principles of the adizes methodology usually companies start with centralization and only if there is a need and pressure they will decentralize i start with decentralization and only if there is a need and pressure i will centralize something so it is the starting point which is important start with decentralization and only if and where needed centralize dan maydan one more thing  we never hesitated taking some experienced people and some bright even new people to create something which was like a startup and we gave them incentives which made them quite rich if they became successful including a portion of the market success which was capped of course but gave them the opportunity to shine and demonstrate their capability to start something like a startup ichak adizes right all these nurseries… dan maydan it was more than a nursery because it included the business nursery is just the development and we let them grow and become independent divisions ichak adizes right right dan did you ever fail and if you did what was it and why dan maydan i like to force people to look in one direction and each individual can only work on one project at a time because succeeding is like a war either you live or you die so you don’t have several opportunities you have only one opportunity and need to go in one direction however going in one direction sometimes you have to change it sometimes you try sequentially and you find out that you are you heading into a dead end and at that point you must make a very very quick correction to divert  and start either from a new beginning or based on the knowledge you had from before continue and then at the end if a good product comes out of it you are successful regardless of the difficulties of on the way to success ichak adizes so what you are really saying is there is no such thing as failure because failure can be a learning experience for you to take corrected action and eventually succeed so there is no such thing as failure dan maydan and that depends on management more than anybody if they get some budget and then they find out that you didn’t perform they should take everything away from you of course that has to be done from time to time but many times if you recognize the capabilities and you recognize that there is still light at the end of this tunnel it’s up to top management to continue and instead of punishing reward those individuals when they reach the light at the end of this tunnel and make it a success ichak adizes i would like to tell the audience about an experience that i had with another client which i think pinpoints this principle you are talking about i was having dinner with him and he got a telephone call and went to the phone when he came back his face was a little bit long so i asked him “alan what happened” and he said “oh i just learned i lost  million dollars” and i asked him “how does it feel to lose  million dollars” and he told me something which i always repeat in my lectures and it really highlights what dan is talking about alan said “ichak i look at it this way i’m just thinking i’m a very lucky man” i said “what do mean lucky man you lost  million dollars” he says “well i’m lucky because i know very few people can afford to take a course in life whose tuition is  million dollars i could afford the  million dollars tuition and that is very very unusual so i’m lucky now the question is did i pass the exam  did i pass the exam or did i fail the exam of this course did i learn anything from this course so that i can be better in the future i just wasted  million dollars tuition for a course i have taken if didn’t learn anything” look at a failure as an opportunity for learning what can you learn from it what did god want you to learn from it so you can do better in the future and eventually actually succeed if you learned it was not a failure it was a “class” you took dan another question i know that one of the things that people were struggling with at applied materials is—we were working together and i was your advisor— and many many companies have this problem all over the world and it is applied materials was a multinational company that had markets in china and in the far east in japan in germany and europe united states and we needed to structure the organization to be globally product oriented so it was globalthinking but localacting and we always had to balance if everything is structured around globalthinking and it’s too centralized then we defocus the local market but if we pay attention to the local market and ignore the central thinking then the danger is that we lose control what is the right balance between headquarters and markets can you recall how we solved it dan maydan one important criterion is that for each region you have to maintain and do the business based on the culture of the local region and that is what we did we always put local people in as the general manager and employees of a particular region and yet they worked for the global company yet certain activities must be controlled centralized for example the financial organization was common to all of them even though it was distributed geographically we had a controller or financial person in japan or in china or in europe the cfo’s job was to travel from one place to another and assure that all of these organizations conform to the laws as prescribed in the united states without violating of course any law in the other regions  we had meeting of all these regions on a monthly basis where we all met together and decided on the distribution of responsibilities and the direction we wanted to go of course some regions were a lot more difficult to manage some were easier but we always made sure that we took the best advantage of each local country because after all they have a different culture they served different kinds of people and there are things for sure which they know better than us at headquarters ichak adizes dan what would you recommend to a manager who is looking for advice what would be the ten commandments you would tell him or her what should he or she watch for what would be the bottom line dan maydan well you know the business is like a reverse pyramid the bottom is the product without the product there is no company however the product by itself is not the whole thing it’s not more than  percent so you really need to assure that there is innovation all across the board in operations in finance in sales in marketing every place second thing you need to remember that you must have satisfied employees satisfied customers and you need to think very carefully because there is more than one formula how to satisfy these stakeholders and watch and give your organization the opportunities to succeed because your job is basically just to orchestrate and assure that the strategy’s the proper one and implementation is done by people that are better than you and never hesitate to give the responsibilities to all those individuals who have a lot of capabilities one plus one will then be equal to four rather than two ichak adizes dan could you repeat this “hire people that are better than you” many managers are scared to hire people that are superior because they are afraid that they are going to be pushed out that those people are going to make them look stupid that they are going to make them look bad so they don’t want people who are better or smarter working under them dan maydan most managers you find are trying to build an organization based on their own image and when you do that you narrow yourself to a very large extent you really need to build a diverse type of organization you need to bring in people who are very different from you you need to bring people who you at least believe are better than you and rather than be afraid of them to understand that we all contribute to the same goal and purpose to make the company stronger and better if you create this kind of an environment you will find that you create satisfied people satisfied employees and satisfied suppliers you need to listen to your customer but you need to know yourself what the customer will need a few years from now all those kind of things you can not do if you try to build the company based on your image alone it has to be very broadthinking type of organization ichak adizes well dan one more question because we are coming to an end but i will appreciate if it doesn’t apply just tell me it doesn’t apply that’s fine you had a … very very what i call incredible relationship with your late wife who died young and a family which is unbelievable i mean an integrated supporting loving and integrated family you succeeded in spite of the incredible growth of the company which brings with it a lot of stress company growing at  percent a year from  million to  billion dollars is very stressful it is growing very fast a lot of people being hired  you nevertheless succeeded in maintaining an incredible relationship and balance with your family life how did you do that dan maydan well maybe because i was very fortunate or maybe because i also strongly believe in it you should have a very very good family life it is an essential condition to succeed in your job and indeed in my case it was certainly the case my wife was a phd she worked too she also taught at college but she always knew that the family was numberone  i kept telling employees all along in every speech almost every speech i gave i said “when you start thinking about projects think first about your family and if you are relaxed and you know that you get this kind of support a lot of the tension that you mentioned will just disappear or you will look at it totally differently and i think that for me and even today its  years now since my wife died and i miss her a lot i see the results of what it means to have a good family and if i look back at applied and other activities in my life i know that i could never never possibly do it without having my wife and my children next to me   ichak adizes dan i really appreciate it and for a closure i would appreciate it if you give a testimonial why should companies hire adizes is there anything you will like to tell them so that we can close this conversation on that note dan maydan i think that it’s and it’s not just my opinion it’s an opinion of other people you work for that i know or people whom i send you to that your contribution adizes contribution to our organization was so important was so essential that we probably could not have done what did the way we did unless adizes was next to us guiding us in every single step which mostly had to do with organizational understanding the lifecycle of the corporation and from that reaching the conclusion of what we should do next  for the future ichak adizes dan i thank you very very very much  thank you for this interview dan maydan

valdesuso says  at  dear ichak i really enjoyed rereading this interview with dan within such a rich dialogue what i liked more was the part where he recommends not to solve subordinate’s problems but rather guide and coach them to find the solutions by themselves that is instead of feeding one’s ego to have the wisdom of developing our subordinates abrazos carlos joe white says  at  perhaps a preface briefly indicating the salient points in the interview or the insertion of headlines and sub headlines might answer the question that most readers might be asking……”why should i read all this”
