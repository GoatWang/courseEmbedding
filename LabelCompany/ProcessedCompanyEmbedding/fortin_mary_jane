american general life cos during a turbulent time as its parent corporation american international group inc experienced setbacks and a highly publicized intervention by the federal government after taking over ms fortin faced concerns from employees and used that to develop a strong vision to rebuild confidence and strength by leading focus groups at every american general site across the country ms fortin also led efforts in fixing and strengthening relationships with producers by participating in conferences and webcasts visiting distribution partners and assuring them of american generals strength and stability with hard facts and making sure agents realized how much she personally appreciated each partnership what advice would you give to women entering this fieldi would encourage women who are embarking on their careers to always remember that their lifes journey—both personal and professional—is just that a journey i would advise women to learn from their mistakes and setbacks dont get paralyzed by what should or could have been learn from these experiences but then put them in your past and keep moving forward what is the most interesting thing youve learned in your careerive learned that as you travel lifes journey you will encounter many twists and turns along the way i look back on some of the disappointments and doors that were closed in my life and career and i can honestly say that despite how challenging and difficult some of the events were they made me stronger and better able to navigate the storms that life and work can bring indeed it is because of these challenges that ive gained the strength and courage to take on anything the future might hold in some ways this learning has been quite liberating a real “aha moment” for medid you have a mentor early in your careerive been blessed to work for some amazing leaders one in particular who has definitely impacted my journey is david foy who currently serves as cfo for white mountains insurance group david and i go back over  years to when i first joined hartford life working directly for him he is a leader who takes incredible pride in the development and success of his team he taught me a great deal including the fact that success is truly about the team and not the leader david put real time and effort into helping his people grow and flourish in fact he encouraged me to pursue my mba from the wharton school and also recommended me to take on a new assignment outside of the finance organization at harford life which was running the hartford financial services group incs mutual fund business i was chief accounting officer at the time and david recognized that i would benefit greatly by spending time inside the business and getting closer to distribution product developmentmanagement and marketing—that this experience would help me grow into a stronger executive i remember thinking “is he trying to get rid of me” but i realized that david was putting my career development needs ahead of his needs as cfo of hartford life thats another key lesson—as leaders we need to be selfless and willing to give up our best people to new roles and assignments so that they can develop and growwhat is your dream job outside of your current roleits hard to say because in all honesty i feel like that im living my dream job every day but if i could no longer lead american general i would likely be working with a nonprofit organization whose mission is focused on helping underprivileged children im passionate about helping children and supporting them in a way that allows them to reach their full potential every child deserves that opportunityoutside of family and colleagues whom do you admire mostone individual for whom i have an incredible amount of respect and admiration is bob benmosche aigs president and ceo bob is someone who continues to be a source of admiration and inspiration for me he took on one of the most challenging and daunting business assignments in us history he has led an incredible turnaround at aig with amazing courage conviction and intensity sprinkled with a great sense of humor—all traits that i admire very much in a leader it has been an absolute privilege to work with bob and he will forever have an impact on how i think about leadership and driving business performancewhats your cantmiss tv showwell i cant miss cnbc because its always on in my office i really dont find that i have the time to watch much television at home i often say that we “work hard and play hard” so when im not at work im usually busy with my active family enjoying our time togetherbeyond work what one thing do you want to do or accomplish in lifeto be the best mother possible to my daughter sabrina do you use social media if not why notmy main use of social media is with american generals employees i post regularly to our senior leadership team blog which allows employees to also post comments and ideas im gratified by the ability to have conversations with employees in real time despite the fact that our  dedicated and talented employees are spread out across the us and in the philippines im always interested in ways that we can engage in a productive and entertaining dialogue coming up with new ideas to help improve our business our workplace and our communities about about us customer service contact us
