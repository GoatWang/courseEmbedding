period the hellenistic period concluding remarks praise for the print edition matthews is wellknown for his work in biblical backgrounds    such expertise in backgrounds moves this book beyond a simple introduction of the content and themes of each othb old testamenthebrew bible book to illuminating the worlds both within and behind the othb books    the authors have given significant revision to certain portions of the text restructured the chapters and reworked the study questions to facilitate class discussion and critical thinking    the book is well organized and well written it is easily accessible to the collegelevel student and written with such students in mind    the authors make generous use of maps charts photographs and sidebars to illuminate the information in the main discussions and each section and chapter ends with study questions    the great strength of this book is as suggested by the title the blending of matters related to the text and the context of the othb it not only summarizes what is in the othb but also provides insight into the world of the biblical characters and biblical writers by integrating relevant archaeological data socialhistorical issues and insights from critical scholarship    this textbook does a fine job of preparing the student to read the othb intelligently    a very good introduction to and survey of the othb —review of biblical literature with its focus on student learning matthews’s and moyer’s revised and updated text is even more brilliant than their first edition artistic in its design and solid in its content and presentation this work provides students with the necessary background to understand the bible and its diverse cultures and rich heritage with its engaging style and sharp attention to biblical methodology archaeology history and literary genre as well as its clear explanations of important biblical terms and thoughtful study questions this text is a gem for both students and teachers alike i have used the first edition of this book for several years and my students have enjoyed it tremendously i look forward enthusiastically to sharing this second edition with them it is a superb work and i am grateful to victor matthews and james moyer for providing teachers of the bible with a text that answers the needs of today’s students —carol j dempsey associate professor of theology biblical studies university of portland oregon here’s a useful book for those just beginning to approach the old testament for the first time at any depth it is clearly based on classroom teaching and is attractively laid out with ‘boxes’ and ‘insets’ for special details diagrams and some pictures study questions at the end of each section would help a student on hisher own to grasp what has just been studied    a helpful book that brings the text to us and its context and questions of interpretation —anvil in the second edition the authors have done a significant revision    however the basic structure remains the same    important concepts are printed in bold and explained fully in a glossary at the end of the book this is a fine undergraduate textbook that examines not only the literary and historical aspects of the biblical texts but also the social context of the people —the bible today this book is more a total reworking than a simple revision of the original text    the authors believe they have achieved greater clarity expansion and greater attention to certain sections especially on the prophets my reading confirms that the authors have met if not surpassed their goals restructured chapters provide better uniformity in length an aid to teaching reworking study questions permit better class discussion and critical thinking exercises new sidebars help in translation and explanation of ancient texts there are updated archaeological insights and an expanded glossary    this book would be a helpful resource for all congregational and seminary libraries and an excellent text for students and teachers —church and synagogue libraries originally published in  and now presented as a thoroughly revised second edition the book by v matthews and james c moyer is a textbook for undergraduates on the ot it combines the history of israel ably surveyed with the introduction to the individual books that are dealt with in the canonical sequence

just beginning to approach the old testament for the first time at any depth it is clearly based on classroom teaching and is attractively laid out with boxes and insets for special details diagrams and some pictures study questions at the end of each section would help a student on hisher own to grasp what has just been studieda helpful book that brings the text to us and its context and questions of interpretation anvil matthews is wellknown for his work in biblical backgroundssuch expertise in backgrounds moves this book beyond a simple introduction of the content and themes of each othb old testamenthebrew bible book to illuminating the worlds both within and behind the othb booksthe authors have given significant revision to certain portions of the text restructured the chapters and reworked the study questions to facilitate class discussion and critical thinkingthe book is well organized and well written it is easily accessible to the collegelevel student and written with such students in mindthe authors make generous use of maps charts photographs and sidebars to illuminate the information in the main discussions and each section and chapter ends with study questionsthe great strength of this book is as suggested by the title the blending of matters related to the text and the context of the othb it not only summarizes what is in the othb but also provides insight into the world of the biblical characters and biblical writers by integrating relevant archaeological data socialhistorical issues and insights from critical scholarshipthis textbook does a fine job of preparing the student to read the othb intelligentlya very good introduction to and survey of the othb phillip camp review of biblical literature in the second edition the authors have done a significant revision    however the basic structure remains the same    important concepts are printed in bold and explained fully in a glossary at the end of the book this is a fine undergraduate textbook that examines not only the literary and historical aspects of the biblical texts but also the social context of the people the bible today this book is more a total reworking than a simple revision of the original textthe authors believe they have achieved greater clarity expansion and greater attention to certain sections especially on the prophets my reading confirms that the authors have met if not surpassed their goals restructured chapters provide better uniformity in length an aid to teaching reworking study questions permit better class discussion and critical thinking exercises new sidebars help in translation and explanation of ancient texts there are updated archaeological insights and an expanded glossarythis book would be a helpful resource for all congregational and seminary libraries and an excellent text for students and teachers church and synagogue libraries originally published in  and now presented as a thoroughly revised second edition the book by v matthews and james c moyer is a textbook for undergraduates on the ot it combines the history of israel ably surveyed with the introduction to the individual books that are dealt with in the canonical sequencethe book includes helpful study questions international review of biblical studies product reviews▼▲ be the first to write a review write review ask a question▼▲ have a
