compressor expander pump heat pump genset combined cycle the possible applications are mindbogglingthe impact is gamechanging simple radmax radically reduces the unique part count reducing manufacturing assembly inventory and maintenance costs efficient radmax delivers better than  hp per pound of engine weight and more than  hp per cubic inch of engine displacement compact radmax engines pumps and compressors are between  to  times smaller than comparable devices radmax devices will also weigh up to  times less than other engines pumps or compressors of the same power rating powerful radmaxs compact size and high output result in up to  times the size and weightsavings over a piston engine of the same horsepower smaller carbon footprint radmax devices are some of the lightest and most efficient ever designed not only are they more fuel efficient than comparable output devices they require a lower manufacturing footprint this means less material shorter manufacturing timeframes fewer manhours and less weight for shipping dividend update the radmax rotary technology utilizes patented sliding vanes that move over a cam to compress gasses move fluids or expand gasses to generate power from combustion or other high pressure sources of energy bizapediacom  human validation companiespeopleproductsservicestrademarksaddressesphone book our system has

us inc otc bb rgus frankfurt stock exchange rgj and reg technologies inc tsx venture exchange rrev otc bb regrf are pleased to announce that they have integrated a rotary union into the radmax™ fabrication process to reduce temperature in the radmax™ demonstration model robert grisar vice president of engineering for regi us inc said this device allows us to provide continuous highpressure lubrication and cooling oil to moving and rotating parts of radmax thus allowing the engine to operate at a lower temperature oil is injected by this device into a hollow driveshaft with exit ports inside the rotor this in turn allows us to use lighter components made from aluminum which further reduces the weight of the engine a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the patented radmax engine was performed last year in conjunction with belcan engineering services of phoenix az as a result integration of the rotary union was needed to provide lubrication oil to internal components without this device the internal engine heat would make adoption of aluminum components impossible by reducing heat and weight this leads to enhanced fuel economy in every radmax™ application this integration was one of the fabrication steps that were described in the radmax™ test and certification process presented in our march   news release a picture of the rotary union is available on the companies
