ago the top  or  companies have become the top five or six or seven as part of a series ocular surgery news embarks on an exploration of the recent past and impending future of todays players in the ophthalmic arena i spoke with david ei pyott chairman of the board president and chief executive officer of allergan inc and james v mazzo corporate vice president and president europeafrica middle east region and global surgical business also of allergan about the recent past the future and what drives business decisions at their company mr pyott joined allergan in  upon his installation as allergans ceo he made a major commitment to research and development including pumping a larger amount of money into the division he also restructured his upper management and added to allergans global sales force mr mazzo who joined allergan in  has held positions with the company in sales marketing and various management roles in the united states canada and europe it is clear that serendipity a focused understanding of their philosophical approach to the customer and of the profile of an ideal business partner and a wellresearched product and productline plan have led to a successful path for this company joanmarie stiglich elseditor in chief ocular surgery news in recent years allergan has secured several marketing and distribution alliances and has launched multiple products globally including venturing into the refractive arena as a result the watching ophthalmic community has speculated as to what type of company allergan wants to be david ei pyott the pharmaceutical side is our largest and fastest growing business so it is always natural that is where you end up currently  of our business is pharmaceutical products from a company standpoint that is where we start thinking first it is a simple strategy  develop a total and complete line of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals we literally one by one plugged all the holes that we found in our product line until we got down to microholes which is where you have to say you cant do everything once you have products almost lying on top of each other it just doesnt pencil out on the surgical side the strategy is different when i joined i would say that we suffered a form of psychological inferiority complex to alcon where  of their business is surgical we were trying to be a little alcon which does not work psychologically nor in any other way so when i first joined we had a totally white sheet of paper so that everything was new in principle we said we would like to be specialists in foldable lenses and phaco looking back at  if i had told the team that we were going to be no  in foldable lenses in andahalf years in europe they would have looked at me like i was off my rocker  let alone if i had said in andahalf years we would be no  in phaco in europe but we have achieved both of those things then the next part is refractive when i first joined we asked our customers what should we be doing that we are not it became clear with consistent messages that if we want to be a leader we have to be in refractive so we thought about that and looking back i think it was wisdom versus luck we thought we really dont want to acquire a laser company or an equipment company we are not big fans of equipment because of the sales cycles which often bunch up in one time frame we decided we wanted to do it a different way that is where serendipity and luck works out we met with surgical instrument system ag of biel switzerland who made the amadeus microkeratome our instincts told us immediately that the product looked desirable looked new and looked like it had some great features and benefits and those initial instincts proved true by this stage alcon had bought summit and we were pretty shocked by the amount they paid for it shortly after we approached visx and said we have a microkeratome you dont we dont want to be in the laser business and youre the big dog in the laser business how can we work together so that was the beginning of the alliance osn this was a usbased alliance first mr pyott yes and we had the discussion internally that even if visx is weak outside the united states we would form an alliance globally it didnt make sense allying by country because it would not be a true partnership osn describe the sales force interaction james mazzo we are partners globally with visx we work together to identify the opportunities and then we leverage together but we let each other execute each product line mr pyott it is essentially lead generation once a customer says they want to buy a system the sales person will say ill get my counterpart osn and what about joint marketing plans mr mazzo the separate marketing plans fit together you will see joint promotions at conventions and seminars for instance we just did a major program in italy together that brings in customers to see both visx and allergan ultimately both companies have not lost an identity but gained exposure to new customers what i think has been extremely successful for us is that we havent gone in and tried to take in a knowledge base that we did not have and they have not tried to come in and take a knowledge base that they did not have ultimately we have to do what is best for the customer the customers couldnt care less if this is a business contractual relationship but rather are concerned with how this is going to work for them sometimes you do comarketing sometimes you acquire sometimes you license and in the case of the allerganvisx partnership it was a winwin we have no desire to be in medical equipment from a laser standpoint and they dont have a desire today to have a microkeratome we are both leading companies i think what is important is that both companies have to have a similar philosophical understanding of how you want to treat the customer and in this case premium quality premium price you have to be careful in how you select your partners we are big into continuing education there are some companies that do not think that way osn what can you tell me about the impending european launch of lumigan and how is this launch similar to your other recent global launches mr pyott unlike with devices the food and drug administration is fast in its approval process for pharmaceuticals on the device side the fda always takes  to  months longer than european agencies as a result all companies launch surgical products in europe first with pharmaceuticals we are particularly lucky that the ophthalmic division of the fda is quick since ive been on board the past  years at least  of the applications have been given fast track status thus turning them around in  months also they have been rather pragmatic on the glaucoma studies where they say ok show us  months of data and then file and during the filing process you have month data available that supplements the original filing the europeans have been sticklers saying file month data and nothing less in pharmaceuticals we always launch in the united states first latin america typically follows next because they are flexible and have good relationships with the united states in the large countries brazil argentina and mexico you have to submit an independent file but they are heavily influenced by what works in the united states lumigan is now on the market in brazil and argentina mexico and chile will be following shortly europe will be next mr mazzo for the launch of alphagan we filed using the european mutual recognition procedure mrp the mrp uses a reference member country to carry out the primary review if the product is accepted this country will give a recommendation to other countries who may either accept or reject the product at the end of the procedure licenses are issued on a national basis the product is thus launched country by country for the launch of lumigan we chose to file using the european centralized procedure cp the review is carried out in two countries by a rapporteur and corapporteur it results in a single european license facilitating a pan european launch europe the united states latin america and asia  globalization of products  that is our goal four or  years ago we each had individual products that were specific to the countries now we have global products and launches mr pyott when i looked at the history of alphagan and i shouldnt be too critical because it is the no  ophthalmology product in the world after xalatan and the speed at which they rolled that product out i said dont try that with me four years between country one and country  was unacceptable about a year ago i asked the product management to give me a list by month of the top  markets in the world when lumigan would be launched i made it clear that the list was going into their personnel files what gets measured in this company gets done it is part of our management system and i know from market  to market  it will be about  years mr mazzo besides having consistent campaigns this industry is small what i mean by that is our customers in europe are already making assumptions and forming ideas about lumigan because they go to the united states and attend symposia that is a blessing but it is also a curse if you dont have a quick time frame for your launch so the physicians are being educated even though the product is not approved allergan is coming out with a lot of new drugs in a short amount of time we have to maximize these assets emanating from our strong rd team it is incumbent upon us to do global launches osn when do you expect lumigan to be launched in europe mr pyott lumigan should be launched in early  osn what products will you be filing in the near future mr pyott an alphaganbetablocker combination will be filed at the end of  we have a lumiganbetablocker combination that will be filed in  in the allergy arena we have alocril however we only have the licensing rights from aventis for canada the united states and mexico we will file epinastine another allergy product in united states and europe in  this will be a new entry into allergy for us we have worldwide licensing rights excluding japan from boehringer ingelheim to develop epinastine for the treatment of ocular allergies gatifloxacin which is a nextgeneration antiinfective will likely be filed in  this is beneficial as we lose the patent on ocuflox in late  restasis cyclosporine ophthalmic suspension allergan for the treatment of dry eye received an approvable letter in mid the fda ruled that the drug needed an additional study we believe the study will be done by  when we submit the data  it will be a pretty quick review by the fda  it will be either thumbs up or thumbs down we also entered into an agreement with inspire pharmaceuticals inc inspires ins ophthalmic is really a synergistic product with cyclosporine restasis prevents an inflammatory cascade particularly for severe dry eye and inspire ins is indicated for the treatment of moderate dry eye the negotiations were interesting  like dancing a tango they thought that we wanted their product to bury it we tried not to think on the dark side that restasis wont make it but if it was not to be it would be nice to have inspire if we were so lucky as to have both approved then we could literally have products for the whole dryeye market in combination with our refresh product line mr mazzo we can discuss our pharmaceutical expected filings because our competitors can pretty much chart these dates out with medical devices we are not public until we come out but we are not complacent on the surgical side at escrs this year we released four new products and product improvements mr pyott in may  allergan entered into an inlicense agreement with oculex pharmaceuticals for oculexs proprietary biodegradable bdd and reservoir rdt drug delivery technologies which are used for the back of the eye we entered this agreement thinking critically that one area of weakness we still have is in retinal diseases also visudyne is the only game in town for agerelated macular degeneration we have a dye which is licensed from japan that we believe is better than visudyne it is a classical secondgeneration product unfortunately we will probably have to wait until  osn so you have an entry into vitret pharmaceuticals what about surgical mr pyott i dont want to say no never  but not now osn and the rest of the surgical side mr mazzo on plan we came out a little later with an acrylic iol we waited because if we came out with just another acrylic why should a physician switch but in a short period of time since we released the sensar in europe we are already at  of market share overall as the no  iol company we command a  share of the smallincision market in europe as per quarter  of  osn skin care is about  of your business mr pyott yes our skin care division remains strong if we were to make an acquisition dermatology is probably one of the first places we would go in the dermatology arena many of the big players are withdrawing only novartis avenis and johnson  johnson are showing signs of life but beyond that all the major pharmaceutical companies are saying these products are too small because they dont reach that  million threshold for which they are looking sounds just like ophthalmology all those little products which is why we like dermatology we like products that are in the  to  million range osn what about your pipeline mr pyott for  we spent  more on rd than we were in  in eye care rd alone we will be spending close to  million on the surgical side we are working on the next improvements for existing products we are also researching ways to get around other peoples patents which is another part of the whole device industry we dont let anyone know what we are doing until we release and then they scratch their heads thinking up ways to get around our patents osn whats next mr pyott we have the largest ophthalmology sales force worldwide which of course prepositions us for being no  by  this year the growth has been slower in the first half of  the way we describe it is that we feel that we are between two elevator banks even though alphagan is growing it is not enough for the rates we need that is why we need lumigan to give us the next round explosive growth we have a lot of studies looking at lumigan with alphagan because glaucoma specialists are interested in additive drugs in treatment and we want to replicate what we have achieved in europe in the surgical arena in the united states and japan mr mazzo globalization and harmonization is great but we also dont lose the natural touch for the individual market at the end of the day the italian ophthalmologists versus the german ophthalmologists versus the brazilian ophthalmologists still have their own needs why we have been successful is that we have been able to streamline the process of getting drugs to customers quicker and we have been able to harmonize our message but tactically the daytoday customer interaction is still done by the local organization i think that is what has been our measure of success harmonize at the strategic level harmonize your message but dont lose the empathy of the individual customer that is a critical message that illustrates the reason behind the success of allergan mr pyott what is outstanding to me is that many companies with the exception of the two as do not take great care of their customers we are the two companies that take care of our customers the most the others for some reason just dont get it its not rocket science with the acquisitions and mergers and the major pharmaceutical and refractive launches that have taken place from the late s to the present the face of the ophthalmic industry has noticeably changed the major ophthalmic companies left standing are
