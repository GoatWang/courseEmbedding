metric for silver wheaton corp investors to focus on big deals made the last few years exciting for gold and silver streaming company silver wheaton now its time to watch organic growth reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer mar   at am silver wheaton corp nyseslw was able to grow its business at a time when gold and silver miners were struggling through a commodity downturn with preciousmetals prices on the mend however the opportunities for big streaming deals arent as good and that means its time for investors to watch silver wheatons production trends a little more closely big years silver wheaton is a streaming company and has a unique business model in the preciousmetals space it essentially gives money up front to miners in exchange for the right to buy silver and gold at reduced prices in the future to put some numbers on that it pays around  an ounce for silver about  of revenues and  an ounce for gold about  of revenues  well below the current spot price for each of these precious metals image source silver wheaton analyst presentation the question that should quickly come to mind is why would a miner want to sell gold or silver so cheaply when a miner signs a deal with silver wheaton it needs the cash when other options  like selling stock issuing bonds or going to a bank  are less desirable thats why the commodity downturn was so good for silver wheaton big companies with operating mines were struggling financially and desperate for cash that few wanted to provide silver wheaton stepped into the void for example in  silver wheaton was able to ink two  million deals one with vale sa nysevale and another with glencore two of the largest miners in the world the terms of the vale deal were for silver wheaton to buy gold from the salobo mine at the lesser of  an ounce or the going spot price  a really good deal for the streaming company vale meanwhile used the cash to fund development plans for its giant sd ironore mine and to pay down debt a winwin in fact vale came back for more in  letting silver wheaton make another  million streaming deal at the same mine summary stats for the salobo mine deals image source silver wheaton deals like this allowed silver wheaton to opportunistically expand its business during the downturn silverequivalent production increased  between  and  and jumped another  in  with preciousmetals prices on the rebound however investors shouldnt count on more big deals like that silver wheatons production outlook is relatively flat through   from the operating mines in its portfolio watch the production to be fair even if production doesnt expand a preciousmetals rally could still boost the companys top and bottom lines but real growth in the business will need to show up in the production numbers and thats why now is the time to keep a close eye on production growth you see another reason why miners sign streaming deals is to pay for earlystage development and expansion projects silver wheaton has a number of these deals on the books but the projects arent up and running yet the problem is that these investments take longer to bring on line and their outcomes are far less certain than investing in a mine thats already operational but theyre where silver wheatons growth is going to come from in the next few years that said theres a huge opportunity with more than  silverequivalent ounces of optionality as silver wheaton calls it built into its portfolio silver wheatons production growth is all about optionality image source silver wheaton its silver wheatons production growth that will tell you if it made the right investments or not for example silver wheaton has invested in barrick gold’s nyseabx pascualama mine a development project that has been mired in political and environmental drama for years although the opportunity at pascualama is huge it may never live up to its potential but if it does it could provide a huge boost to the companys production numbers a different part of the cycle silver wheaton did a great job of expanding its business while the opportunity was there during the commodity downturn but now it looks like were heading into a different phase of the typical boomandbust cycle for miners you should definitely pay attention to the companys financial results but dont overlook production growth that will tell you how well silver wheaton is doing now that miners are no longer as desperate for cash if the optionality in its portfolio doesnt turn into physical production then silver wheatons future wont be as bright as its recent past
