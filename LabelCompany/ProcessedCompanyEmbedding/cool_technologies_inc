truck brochures blog third party testing homethermal dispersionthird party testing third party testingtjhtjht three independent labs have tested cool technologies’ heat pipe architecture other tests have been conducted by electric motor manufacturers none of our technologies have ever failed a third party test test  in  essco pumps  controls a member of the hydraulic institute conducted the tests in accordance with standards set forth by the institute essco assembled typical submersible motors one standard submersible and one incorporating our technology two tests were performed the first was a backtoback comparison with each operated in a drypit mode the results the standard submersible operated at full load for  minutes before it reached a class f temperature and overheated the cool technologies’ motor operated for  minutes before reaching class f temperature the second test validated the heat removal capabilities of cool tech’s heat pipe architecture by circulating a small amount of water  gpm through the oil chamber cool tech’s motor operated continuously without ever reaching class f temperature what it means with our technology one design can do it all a single motor rating can function in drypit submersible and explosionproof applications current pump manufacturing practice calls for a separate rating for each application test  on december   essco pumps and controls conducted a second test—the time using a dry pit submersible pump — with even better results dry pit submersible pumps are commonly used in national state and municipal waste water utilities worldwide as well as in the mining dredging and oil drilling industries the tests examined the tolerances of an industrial electric motor in an extreme situation the tolerances determine the amount of power that can be driven through pumps run by the motor and are a strong predictor of the maintenance and other service downtime the pump will require the original pump motor was rated to run without submersion for up to  minutes before the pump’s protective circuits will turn it off to prevent overheating this heat limitation restricts the output of the motor the test pump used the same industrial electric motor except with our thermal dispersion technology incorporated the result the test pump ran without submersion for more than two hours at or above full power without reaching critical temperatures that would have caused an automatic shutdown what it means the tests confirmed the company’s belief that our heat pipe cooling system equals the effectiveness of a more complex watercooled system therefore simple designs incorporating our thermal technology combined with the proven increase in potential output should result in lower costs to manufacture by reducing the amount of material needed to produce a pump or electric motor with a specific output test  on december   mohler technology inc of boonville indiana tested an alternator enhanced with our technology a kva alternator generator was run at full load to test its operational limits the heat produced by generators of that size must be removed or controlled in order for the alternator to operate effectively manufacturers’ current best practice is to add either a liquid cooling system or an extra large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat both practices increase the cost and complexity of the generators  kva generators are commonly used in the mining telecom water treatment and oil and gas industries as well as used to provide backup power for heavy industry data centers and healthcare facilities the alternator tested used our thermal technology with no other cooling of any kind the results showed a minimum of  improvement in power density over the manufacturer’s rating for the alternator when operated without water cooling in fact the alternator achieved power densities comparable to a liquidcooled or overframed one what it means once again the tests confirmed our belief that our heat pipe cooling system equals the effectiveness of a more complex watercooled system because motors equipped with our technology deliver more horsepower than any other motor of the same frame designers now have flexibility they can lower costs by using smaller pump or motor designs or they can deliver enhanced performance from their existing motor frames industry interviews – cool tech                                                                                                                                  otcqb warm home

ultimate work truck brochures blog about cool technologies formerly hpev homecompanyabout cool technologies formerly hpev about cool technologies formerly hpevtjhtjht cool technologies inc otcqb warm was founded in february  to commercialize a single patent a composite heat pipe – a game changing solution to a universal problem heat affects anything that moves or generates power heat degrades warps or causes devices to fail outright the solution is to cool or remove the heat cooling lengthens product life and increases power get a motor to run cooler and it’ll generate more power cooling increases efficiency more power with no increase in size is more energy efficient cooling reduces costs generate the same output from a smaller size and fewer raw materials are needed the fewer raw materials needed the less cost to manufacture combine that with increased product life and it reduces the cost to consumers finally almost half of all electricity produced worldwide is consumed by motors and generators so improving their efficiency saves energy in other words cooling is green the problem is removing heat adds cost and complexity to the end product addressing a problemheat pipes effectively remove heat without using pumps or moving parts they’re passive and maintenancefree which is a key benefit because reliability is a critical issue as a result they’re far less expensive than mechanical cooling systems and devices cool technologies’ heat pipes surpass traditional heat pipes because they are the closest thing to super conductors they offer virtually no resistance to thermal energy the heat pipes quickly transfer heat in any direction even against the pull of gravity and they’re effective in any shape or length because they’re sealed they can be shaped to fit any design or mold including engine blocks that eliminates the need for manufacturer retooling or redesign and minimizes capital investment an independent test demonstrated that cool technologies increased motor efficiency by  to  points and improved electric motor performance by  that means a motor enhanced with our technology can deliver more power than other motor of its size and design on the market any kind of electric motor pump compressor generator any kind of engine gas diesel boat jet can benefit expanding the applicationsafter starting with one patent the company kept finding new applications and adding patents to its portfolio submersible motors hermetic motors and more in the meantime cool technologies signed agreements with multinational manufacturers to test the technology in their respective product lines one has completed a computer simulation others are choosing products to prototype but the company hasn’t stopped there heat is a major cause of brake failure why not add the technology to brakes rotors and calipers another inspiration another patentpending and an agreement signed with a racing team to test the technology in a porsche gt club championship car another patent pending to cover applications for bearings soon followed as well combining the technologiesan engineer had a brainstorm to combine technologies his father had pioneered the use of electric vehicles in underground mining and as forklifts in the ’s why not take proven electric vehicle technology match it with an electric motor that’s enhanced with thermal technology add it to an internal combustion vehicle and enable the vehicle to run using whichever is most efficient for the driving conditions it’ll reduce the load on the internal combustion engine which reduces fuel consumption and maintenance costs lowers emissions and lengthens engine life add rechargeable batteries and it could turn any vehicle into a plugin hybrid with what the company now refers to as ‘electric load assist’ and so another patentpending and a new conversion targeting fleet and commercial markets facing stricter emissions regulations and increased fuel and other variable costs another engineer realized that our patentpending parallel power platform which already forms the basis of our electric load assist could also power an onboard generator suddenly the ultimate work truck was born existing vehicles can be converted and provide up to kva of auxiliary electric power enough to power  typical us homes for  hours no longer will companies have to tow generators to the work site nor idle the engine to operate bucket truck arms military units can setup and power mobile bases with a single vehicle sandy hits the east coast businesses lose power stores are closed perishables spoil we realize that our patentpending gearing system could power an onboard generator solely from the vehicle’s internal combustion engine customers could enjoy the mobile auxiliary power benefits of the uwt without the need for hybrid conversion one company expresses immediate interest and starts laying the groundwork for a deal the cool tech business modelcool technologies inc is not a manufacturing company every time the company finalizes a platform with a customer the company will derive revenue in the form of a license and royalty or in the case of the case of the uwt and the mobile auxiliary power unit we have set up a group of outsourced vendors and testing facilities that will enable the company to create products under our brand name and derive revenues as well our mission is to find new applications for our patents and commercialize them since april  the company has been awarded  patents and has another  patents pending in the meantime the engineers are

 cool technologies inc key developments cool technologies inc receives order for  mg systems may   cool technologies inc announced that it has received an order for ten mobile generation mg systems from craftsmen the  kva systems are being purchased for installation in the mobile marketing vehicles experiential marketing platforms and industrial mobile solutions that craftsmen designs engineers and produces the industrial mobile solutions include mobile kitchens and offices as well as command and control centers for military utility rental and disaster relief usage the systems will provide an alternative solution with a number of benefits to craftsmen clients especially space weight and cost savings cooltechs generator systems will be installed on the tow vehicles or underneath the selfpowered ones this could free up to  square feet of space in the larger platforms as the mg s deliver the same power at a fraction of the weight of tow behinds they eliminate the need for the additional support sound proofing and exhaust venting plus less weight translates into better gas mileage for the vehicle or the one towing the mobile platform craftsmens clients will also benefit from fewer maintenance requirements because the systems dont require a second engine to drive the generators the cost savings over tow behinds will be an estimated  to start that should increase as
