expectations  this review was written for sovereign books of mortals series  ted dekker and tosca lee have again combined their tremendous writing talent in sovereign the third installment of the book of mortals series as with the first two books the scenes are vividly drawn the writing is crisp and the words flow smoothly sweeping you up into the power of the story from the start the scenes explode with action and i was immediately gripped by the opening chapters as good clashes with evil my favourite character in this story is easily that of jordin who wrestles with doubt and whether shes making the right choices but ultimately has a powerful encounter that opens her eyes to truth and to love all of the characters are very welldeveloped and i enjoyed the twists that are written into the story where nothing is black and white and even the villains invoke sympathy the authors have created a book and an entire series that has so many parallels to the christian walk and what jesus accomplished through his death and through the abundant life he offers us as such the book can be read purely for entertainment value or you can ponder the deeper truths woven into the story i did find that the book dragged a bit for me in the middle but by the end i was glued to the pages to see how everything would resolve i closed the pages thinking about the strength of my own faith in jesus and how fully ive allowed his truth to bring freedom into every part of my life any book that has me mulling over issues of faith while providing an absorbing ride is definitely worth reading sovereign provides a rich adventure and readers who have enjoyed the first two books in the series are certain to be pleased with this addition i strongly recommend this book and award it  out of

along with her late husband dupree her son allen and daughterinlaw dayna ran “mrs sassard’s handmade” a mount pleasantbased manufacturer of premium pickles preserves jams and jellies founded in  in addition to being a tireless worker gertrude was a great storyteller and wit whose bemused skepticism about the capabilities of those around her—particularly her wholesale customers—kept everyone laughing around the production kitchen a great part of the pleasure of collecting our cases of iced tomato pickles and pickled peaches from the sassard house on church street was visiting with gertrude who typically could be found in the production kitchen peeling sunchokes with a paring knife— and she could peel fast “made its way by the way it’s made” is the company slogan and well describes the effort that goes into everything gertrude touched from the artichokes to the handpeeled pickled peaches to the whole fig preserves jerusalem artichoke relish and the rare pumpkin chip preserves we are saddened greatly by her passing but thanks to her son allen who continues in her footsteps we know the products we love so much will remain on lowcountry tables for years to come in

partnership with duvall catering together the partners will produce oneofakind events that combine duvall’s hallmark finesse with the lee bros’ sense of charleston flavor and style “we reach a wide audience with our cookbooks but rarely do we have the opportunity to show people in person our cooking” said matt lee “teaming up with duvall allows us to share what we do in real time with groups of all sizes and interests” from intimate luncheons to fullscale weddings planners will be offered the opportunity to incorporate the lee bros elements into their special events planners may select from a number of menus designed by the lee bros and even book the duo to appear at their event “matt and ted have drawn a bead on what makes charleston and its cooking so unique” said steve wenger duvall ceo “we’re excited to tap their expertise and give our clients added options value and a connection to the lowcountry for their events” matt and ted first partnered with duvall and the company’s executive chef matt greene last fall for a fundraiser hosted at growfood carolina the meal that resulted—a sixcourse dinner for  people in growfood’s wholesale produce warehouse on morrison drive—elicited raves from diners and set off light bulbs in the minds of the two parties “we’ve always admired the technical expertise of professional caterers but chef greene’s team raised the bar for us” said ted lee “duvall took our vision for a rather complicated menu of rarefied lowcountry ingredients and never flinched from the challenge if anything chef greene pushed us to take bigger risks than we’d planned with the recipes” duvall’s new  squarefoot facility on azalea drive gives the team access to backofhouse amenities as well as a stateoftheart demonstration kitchen able to accommodate up to  guests the lee bros will commemorate the new alliance with a demonstration for charlestonbased event planners and tour guides later this month there are also plans to work with duvall to create retail products in their usdainspected kitchen “we’ve been searching for a way to package boiled peanuts as wedding favors and we think we have the tools we need now” matt said this spring matt and ted published their third cookbook the lee bros charleston kitchen which pat conroy called “a work of art” and which the wall street journal called “a gastronomic tourdeforce” their first two cookbooks the lee bros southern cookbook and the lee bros simple fresh southern have won a combined five james beard and iacp cookbook awards matt and ted “ok that was the official announcement but we just have to add that we are stoked for this our association with the company began in the s mom and dad were frequent customers and the original owners became close family friends in fact the sewing machine we used to stitch up the first lee bros boiled peanuts catalogue was a gift from peter milewicz” the business was sold to the current owner steven wenger in about  and duvall’s role as the category leader in the charleston area has only grown under his keen leadership in the decades since duvall’s staff is supersmart incredibly hardworking resourceful and fun their gigantic new facility just north of the city will give us the resources—including a usda inspected food processing kitchen—to pursue a wide range of projects and opportunities that may come our way in
