deliberate historically tested and successful investment strategy is more likely to identify attractive investment opportunities than a “gutfeel” historically untested approach to investing  markets are inefficientparticularly shortterm millcreek believes that markets are inefficient particularly with respect to shorter time horizons millcreek believes there are identifiable behavioral and pricing patterns or tendencies in the market  risk is inherent to investing and cannot be eliminated millcreek believes that risk is inherent in the process of investing  millcreek seeks to intelligently address those risks inherent to its investment strategy but understands that risk cannot be eliminated and strong returns should not be expected without also accepting the associated risk how does millcreek define an investment strategy identification and implementation of attractive investment opportunities millcreek seeks to identify attractive investment opportunities by testing potential strategies in an effort to identify those that have historically generated strong longterm returns while reducing downside risk  approach to addressing risk inherent in the chosen strategy because risk cannot be eliminated from investing the most that investors can hope for is an intelligent approach to addressing risks inherent in the strategy risk management is incorporated throughout millcreeks investment process including algorithm development portfolio structuring and algorithm monitoring  active investment management millcreek creates strategies that are actively managed using a portfolio of algorithms that are created in an effort to exploit historical investor behavioral and market pricing patterns these algorithms use current and recent market data to make daily adjustments to the portfolio based on the longterm historical results of making similar adjustments in similar market circumstances millcreek seeks to identify and profit from these historical investor behavioral and market pricing patterns by quantifying these patterns in a portfolio of proprietary algorithms millcreek utilizes this portfolio of algorithms to dynamically tactically and actively adjust its positions additional information and performance updates are available upon request through our contact page how do clients typically incorporate millcreek’s strategies additional
