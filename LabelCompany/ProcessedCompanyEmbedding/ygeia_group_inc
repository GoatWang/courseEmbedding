budget levels where we believe there are significant demand for our services and the potential for attractive returns to our company and investors we do not consider our company to be a blank check company as such term is defined in securities and exchange commission rule  however we are a company with minimal revenues and limited operations and our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the company is not a blankcheck company and is not being formed for the purposes of a reverse merger or any other like transaction the company has no present plans to be acquired or to merge with another company nor does the company nor any of its shareholders have plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction the company does now and will continue to operate as an advisory company on a feebased compensation basis for independent clients requiring our expertise experience and international contact networks any acquisitions that the company may make in the future would be of companies similar in nature to our own operating in similar or complementary industry segments or geographic location that would provide ygcg with new growth opportunities or competitive advantage however even though our business plan does contemplate potential growth through the acquisition of specialty service providers and other independent consulting services companies that would complement our business plan we are first and foremost a business consulting company ygcg anticipates growth through the consolidation of consulting service providers proprietary processes and small to midsized independent management consulting companies that operate in related industries our management has designed an aggressive but straightforward strategy to transition ygcg to a full service independent consultant to the healthcare industry solutions provider in addition to our consulting with minimal risk to the existing operation we believe that our conduct to date evidences significant bona fide business operations and a scenario that is wholly inapposite to any attempt to create the mere appearance of a specific business plan and effort to avoid the application of rule  the company is focused on addressing areas of business which concentrate on healthcare business operations hospital operations healthcare information technology trends and those related components that assist in advancing healthcare on a national and global scale these include  healthcare strategy and planning  accountable care organizations  healthcare information
