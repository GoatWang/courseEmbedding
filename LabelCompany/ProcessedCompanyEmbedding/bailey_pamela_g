information they need to achieve and maintain a healthy diet and active lifestyle “the food industry’s track record on health  wellbeing speaks for itself since  we have introduced more than  new product choices with fewer calories reduced fat sodium and sugar and more whole grains through the healthy weight commitment foundation we have pledged to remove  trillion calories from the food

calories consumed through food and beverages with the appropriate amount of physical activity as recommended by the federal government’s dietary guidelines for americans including eating a variety of foods in moderation combined with at least  minutes of daily physical activity wwwchoosemyplategov “gma and its member companies strongly support first lady michelle obama’s goal of solving childhood obesity within a generation  if we are going to meet that goal everyone – industry government parents schools communities and healthcare providers – must do their part “the food and beverage industry
