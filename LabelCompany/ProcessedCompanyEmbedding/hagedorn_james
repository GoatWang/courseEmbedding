applied madison avenue wizardry to the plant food named miracle gro and sold it to just about every one of the post war suburbanites who yearned for a green thumb died in january  at his home in sands point ny  he was eightynine miraclegro which produced the world’s biggest cabbage cantaloupe and dahlia soon became as familiar a site in the american backyard as the station wagon in the carport  the gardening business is now estimated to exceed  billion in annual sales and miraclegro’s share of the home fertilizer market is estimated to be  percent mr hagedorn orchestrated the growth of his product like the marketing genius that he was  he hired a norman rockwell colleague to paint homey advertisements and actor james whitmore whose gnarled face suggested a trustworthy farmer for television commercials  the  dollar prize he offered for a tomato of world record size was conditional on the use of a “certain” plant food the green and yellow package he commissioned became so famous that other companies including att and hyundai used it in ads for their products  mr hagedorn charged them nothing as long as they spelled miraclegro correctly “he was a huckster” his son james said with cheerful affection  “one of those like carnival salesmen” james also said his father was a sophisticated harddriving businessman  when the scotts company the huge garden products concern merged with miraclegro in  most news reports said scotts was absorbing the smaller plant food company  a year later horace hagedorn told the wall street journal that he had acquired scotts by insisting on an allstock transaction the deal left the hagedorns the largest shareholders with  percent of the company and  of the  board seats  horace was vice chairman and james was president  james is now also chairman and chief executive “the truth of the matter is scotts didn’t buy miraclegro” horace said  “the truth of the matter is we bought scotts” tadd c seitz the interim chief executive of scotts at the time of the journal article grudgingly acknowledged that the deal was far from a swallowing of miraclegro  “more than perhaps people perceived in the beginning” he said mr hagedorn a multimillionaire drove a gremlin for many years and said he owned three suits and two pairs of shoes  he gave tens of millions to children’s charities and got special attention when he supported the education of  poor brooklyn schoolchildren with the goal of sending them to college  about  percent are going to college and mr hagedorn recently offered a sixthgrade class in columbus ohio the same deal horace hagedorn was born on march th  in manhattan where his father was a real estate speculator  he earned a business degree from the university of pennsylvania and began his working career selling advertising time on the radio  he then produced a radio drama “the big story” a crime drama series he moved on to a small manhattan advertising agency around the time he had a conversation with martin small the celebrated advertising man credited with inventing rollon deodorant  mr hagedorn said mr small told him in five words how to make a million dollars “find a need and fill it” “i said marvin that’s six words” mr hagedorn said in an interview with the washington post in  “and he said ‘so i lied a little’” one day in the mid’s otto stern a germanborn nurseryman from geneva ny walked in the door in person and asked to buy advertising time on the radio program “rambling with gambling” on woram in new york one of the top shows there for many years  mr stern hated to use the telephone because his thick accent made it difficult for people to understand him mr stern sold plants and trees by mail and they were arriving in pretty bad shape  both he and mr hagedorn hit upon the idea of fertilizer and happened to read about the work of a rutgers university professor o wesley davidson an expert in raising orchids  they hired him as a technical consultant to develop a watersoluble fertilizer the ingredients were not entirely mysterious because sellers of fertilizers are required to list the percentages of nitrogen phosphorus potash and other trace elements  but the dry product easy to ship and store is mixed with water and the wetting agents and other ingredients are secrets “we were in the right place at the right time” mr hagedorn said in an interview with the new york times in   he cited the rise in home building after world war ii and a consequent demand for garden products  also mr stern’s mail order nursery business also had many eager customers mr hagedorn’s wife peggy came up with the name miraclegro and the company was founded in   the next year mr stern and mr hagedorn each put in  to buy a full page advertisement in the new york herald  the ad mr hagedorn wrote was sprinkled with scientific phrases about things like radioactive isotopes and promised luxuriant plant growth  within three days they had made ten times what the ad cost after four years miraclegro’s sales had passed  annually and mr hagedorn decided to leave a successful advertising career to work fulltime on miraclegro he bought out mr stern in the mid ’s a couple of years before he died mr hagedorn’s strategy was to advertise on television sell through the emerging new hardware store chains and find a better way to apply the product then the original way of mixing a tablespoon of green granules with a gallon of water  his employees came up with a device to dispense the fertilizer through a garden hose mr hagedorn did not veer from his own expertise doing marketing and sales for miraclegro and farming out manufacturing packaging and distribution to smaller companies  he thus created what might be one of the first “virtual companies” that is companies that exist to be successful brands his son said when mr hagedorn merged with scotts he had already given much of his stock to his children  he took the  million he personally earned from the sale to set up a charitable trust  among many gifts most to children’s causes were contributions to hofstra university’s school of education which is now named for him and to adelphi university’s business school which also carries his name a little more than a year after his wife peggy died in  mr hagedorn was looking at the personal ads in a local paper when he came across one placed by a woman who liked to read seed catalogs and sales his other passion  he answered on miraclegro stationary and he and amelia maiello a prekindergarten teacher were later married she survives him along with his sons james peter robert and paul and his daughters susan and kate  grandchildren and  greatgrandchildren for all his success elsewhere and no matter how much miraclegro he lavished mr hagedorn could

nurseryman from geneva ny walked in the door in person and asked to buy advertising time on the radio program “rambling with gambling” on woram in new york one of the top shows there for many years  mr stern hated to use the telephone because his thick accent made it difficult for people to understand him mr stern sold plants and trees by mail and they were arriving in pretty bad shape  both he and mr hagedorn hit upon the idea of fertilizer and happened to read about the work of a rutgers university professor o wesley davidson an expert in raising orchids  they hired him as a technical consultant to develop a watersoluble fertilizer the ingredients were not entirely mysterious because sellers of fertilizers are required to list the percentages of nitrogen phosphorus potash and other trace elements  but the dry product easy to ship and store is mixed with water and the wetting agents and other ingredients are secrets “we were in the right place at the right time” mr hagedorn said in an interview with the new york times in   he cited the rise in home building after world war ii and a consequent demand for garden products  also mr stern’s mail order nursery business also had many eager customers mr hagedorn’s wife peggy came up with the name miraclegro and the company was founded in   the next year mr stern and mr hagedorn each put in  to buy a full page advertisement in the new york herald  the ad mr hagedorn wrote was sprinkled with scientific phrases about things like radioactive isotopes and promised luxuriant plant growth  within three days they had made ten times what the ad cost after four years miraclegro’s sales had passed  annually and mr hagedorn decided to leave a successful advertising career to work fulltime on miraclegro he bought out mr stern in the mid ’s a couple of years before he died mr hagedorn’s strategy was to advertise on television sell through the emerging new hardware store chains and find a better way to apply the product then the original way of mixing a tablespoon of green granules with a gallon of water  his employees came up with a device to dispense the fertilizer through a garden hose mr hagedorn did not veer from his own expertise doing marketing and sales for miraclegro and farming out manufacturing packaging and distribution to smaller companies  he thus created what might be one of the first “virtual companies” that is companies that exist to be successful brands his son said when mr hagedorn merged with scotts he had already given much of his stock to his children  he took the  million he personally earned from the sale to set up a charitable trust  among many gifts most to children’s causes were contributions to hofstra university’s school of education which is now named for him and to adelphi university’s business school which also carries his name a little more than a year after his wife peggy died in  mr hagedorn was looking at the personal ads in a local paper when he came across one placed by a woman who liked to read seed catalogs and sales his other passion  he answered on miraclegro stationary and he and amelia maiello a prekindergarten teacher were later married she survives him along with his sons james peter robert and paul and his daughters susan and kate  grandchildren and  greatgrandchildren for all his success elsewhere and no matter how much miraclegro he lavished mr hagedorn could never grow a tomato in his own garden that weighed more than three pounds  the world record is  pounds  ounces ny times tuesday february st  douglas martin more information about
