nounfilledarrownounfilledarrowedit nounnounnounclosearrownoun search log in register improve blood sugars fast live longer feel better the blood sugar diet you are here home » the low carb plan the low carb plan eating to control your weight and your blood sugar the mediterraneanstyle low carb approach which we recommend in the blood sugar diet is low in starchy easily digestible carbs but packed full of diseasefighting vitamins and flavonoids it is rich in olive oil fish nuts fruit and vegetables but also contains lots of lovely things that down the years we have been told not to eat such as full fat yoghurt and eggs although it is derived from the eating habits of people living in mediterranean countries you can apply the principles of medstyle eating to a wide range of different cuisines from chinese or indian through to mexican or scandanavian there is extensive evidence for the benefit of the mediterranean style low carbohydrate diet including cutting your risk of heart disease and diabetes it has even been found to reduce risk the risk of breast cancer compared with those on a lowfat diet consuming extra virgin olive oil the fresh squeezed juice of olives seems to be particularly beneficial when it comes to cancer perhaps because it contains compounds such as polyphenols which are known to be antiinflammatory “this is potentially a life changing book for people with raised blood sugar levels as well as those with type  diabetes” dr tim spector professor of genetics kings college london kick the carbs low carb mediterranean style eating – the ‘m plan’ cut right down on sugar sugary treats drinks and desserts no more than once or twice a week and preferably less you can use sugar substitutes like stevia and xylitol but try to wean yourself off your sweet tooth avoid sweet fruits berries apples  pears are fine but sweet tropical fruits such as mango pineapple melon and bananas are full of sugar minimise or avoid the starchy “white stuff” bread pasta potatoes rice be wary of “brown” alternatives the extra fibre can be negligible brown rice is ok but some wholemeal breads have added sugar switch instead to quinoa bulgur cracked wheat whole rye wholegrain barley wild rice and buckwheat avoid most breakfast cereals they are usually full of sugar even the ones that contain bran oats are good as long as they are not the instant sort avoid snacking if possible find healthy snacks if you must nuts are a great source of protein and fibre try to avoid salted or sweetened nuts which can be moreish or a few bits of chopped veg a small amount of dark chocolate after meals  or more start the day with eggs boiled poached scrambled or as an omelette – they’ll keep you fuller for longer than cereal or toast delicious with smoked salmon and a sprinkle of chilli fullfat yoghurt is also good add berries like blackberries strawberries or blueberries for flavour or a sprinkling of nuts eat more healthy fats and oils along with oily fish salmon tuna mackerel consume more olive oil a splash makes vegetables taste better and improves the absorption of vitamins use olive rapeseed or coconut oil for cooking legumes such as lentils and kidney beans healthy and filling use butter instead of margarine cheese in moderation is fine have highquality proteins oily fish prawns chicken turkey pork beef and of course eggs other proteinrich foods soya edamame beans quorn hummus processed meats bacon salami sausages should be eaten only a few times a week eat plenty of different coloured veg from dark leafy greens to brightred and yellow peppers add sauces and flavouring to your veg lemon butter or olive oil salt pepper garlic chilli gravy have a drink but not too many once you are on the ‘maintenance’ bsd way of life try to average no more than one to two units a day a small glass of wine or shot of spirits is  units and cut back on beer – it’s rich in carbs which is why it’s known as “liquid toast” we recommend no alcohol for the first month of the diet this helps the liver kick back into function and to reduce insulin resistance drinking is also likely to undermine your will to succeed   bring back healthy fats they keep you full for longer as they are digested slowly have minimal impact on blood sugar and can make food taste better the low carbohydrate diet allows you to eat a higher fat diet dairy products are back in recent research has found that these do not cause diabetes they are a good source of calcium and protein they also help you feel fuller for longer eat in moderation as they are fairly high in calories a scattering of grated cheese can be used on baked vegetables to add flavour a bit of parmesan on broccoli… eggs forget the idea that cholesterol turns into damaging cholesterol in your arteries and blood…eggs have been reinstated as a healthy  filling source of protein especially good for a quick breakfast – go to work on an egg or two healthy fats  oils are back in too eating fat does not automatically clog the blood vessels in the way that poring oil down the drain will eventually block the drain you make your own cholesterol and lipids and are more likely to increase your levels of the more damaging very low density lipoprotein vld which is made in the liver when you eat a high carbohydrate diet although oil or butter is high in calories it is very slowly digested and surprisingly does not significantly increase your blood sugar it makes vegetables taste better and can improve the absorption of certain vitamins and the essential vitamins a d e  k are only found in certain fats  oils avoid foods containing transfats usually processed foods use oils such as olive oil rapeseed oil or coconut oil it also helps you feel full for longer so be more generous nuts are also included they provide a good source of protein minerals  vitamins contain healthy fats and have a high fibre content you nibble them chuck them in salad or stews they make a good low carb alternative to flour for baking by using almond or coconut flour  tips to help the low carb med style diet work on your blood sugar aim for variety and to eat plenty of green and non starchy vegetables keep trying new things to maintain interest and nutritional balance soups are surprisingly satiating cheap  practical you can take them to work for lunch keep portions in the freezer and they are more slowly digested use lots nonstarchy veg or clear soups like miso soup use grated cauliflower instead of rice or mash it instead of potato much lower calorie  fewer carbs cooksteam the ‘rice’ for a few minutes only you may need to increase your water intake when you reduce carbohydrates beware hidden calories in drinks alcohol is surprisingly high calorie and avoid if possible other liquid calories include fruit juice smoothies  cordials avoid ‘diet’ products they often contain sugar andor sweeteners which may not switch off hunger signals exercise reduces appetite it is good for general cardiovascular fitness and strength but is a hard way to lose weight if you find it hard to exercise simply moving more has significant health benefits and can increase your metabolic rate get up and move around every half hour walk don’t take the bus stairs instead of lift…get a pedometer and try to increase your steps by  each week use flavour enhancers so each meal is as tasty as possible lemon pepper lime chilli garlic gherkins mustard herbs add loads of flavour but very few calories you may crave carbs at first but most people find this settles within a matter of days as your insulin resistance drops so does your appetite in fact most people feel better  find they have more energy if you are also cutting calories by doing the bsd fast  or the bsd  these principles work for fast days and nonfast days but we ask you only to count the calories on the fasting days you can adapt your usual diet and make healthy swops but it may also be helpful to try some new
