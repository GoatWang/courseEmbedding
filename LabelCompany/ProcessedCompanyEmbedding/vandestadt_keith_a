retiresedward a lyon jd ctc last weeks briefs headlined ed lyon retires attracted more opens than any previous issue in six years im not sure if thats a good thing or not i believe it was the british philosopher joe strummer who once sang should i stay or should i go ill be intrigued to see how many of you open this weeks email hinting at keith retiring here at taxcoach were always curious about things like email open rates weve marketed ourselves through direct mail payperclick and trade shows id be willing to test smoke signals and carrier pigeons if i really thought there was a shot they would work sweating over details helps us evaluate every marketing dollar we spend and we want to make sure were not wasting any of them testing and measuring play a big role in that effort our advertising consultants at sterling cooper draper pryce tell us the ad world is divided into two playgrounds theres image advertising — the kind that big dumb companies like coca cola and proctor  gamble do to make us aware of their products and brands and theres direct response advertising — the kind that vince from shamwow does to get us to actually buy both types have their place — but its my firm belief that folks like us just dont have the coin to play the branding game our new marketing director lisa wells comes from a fortune  background where nothing gets done without meetings committees or focus groups shes slooooowly getting me to see the value in branding but she agrees that for companies like ours its a side benefit of directresponse marketing not something we should be throwing money at for its own sake many of you are enjoying the fruit of a successful tax season wondering what youre going to do for the rest of the year ive talked with several allstars and press club members about launching midyear marketing campaigns and i hate to see you waste your money almost as much as i hate to waste my own at taxcoach marketing online makes it easy for us to test and measure we can see exactly how many of our visitors sign up for the briefs then track how many of those readers actually join taxcoach to determine how much a visitor is worth armed with that information we can make smart decisions about how much were willing to pay for those visitors then its just a matter of launching campaigns tracking results and refining our efforts with new information its not quite as easy to do all that for a personal service practice like yours but you can take steps to wring the most out of every marketing dollar you spend here are some essential rules ask every new prospect and client where they come from then write it down someplace safe where you wont forget it dont just file it away in the back of your head the discipline of writing it down will help turn it into a habit and you might just be surprised what you learn im not talking about whether they come from poughkeepsie or narragansett im talking about how they found you — internet search referral seminar set up tracking mechanisms before you launch a campaign are you considering google adwords great do you already know how to access your websites stats package to track results if not you might miss out on valuable insights be extra careful before you invest in things like billboards roadside signs or yellow pages ads with no mechanism for tracking leads there may still be a place for them in your marketing budget — just understand that youll have to work harder to track down the information that tells you whether youre spending your money wisely focus on roi not response rate if i had a dime for every time a taxcoach member asked me what response rate they should expect from their directmail efforts id have at least enough for a roll of stamps seriously though thats the wrong question i could tell you that taxcoach members typically draw between ½ and  depending more than anything else on the quality of their list but what does response percentage mean anyway you cant pay for gas or groceries with response percentage and you can still lose money on a campaign with a great response rate what you really care about it whether your investment in acquiring your next client is worth it — and by how much when you get home from work today theres going to be a capital one credit card offer waiting for you in your mailbox the real mailbox at the end of your driveway not the one on your computer you might think thats dumb considering you just threw away the offer they sent yesterday and ignored the three they sent last week too but capital one isnt dumb at all their analysts are slicing and dicing test results like oakland as manager billy beane in moneyball as wikipedia says capital one has been aggressive about testing since the firm was founded testing everything from product design to marketing to customer selection to collection policies in a single year the company performs tens of thousands of tests allowing it to offer thousands of different types of credit cards to customers based on the knowledge gained from their tests richard fairbank ceo of capital one called test and learn a marketing revolution that can be applied to many businesses you dont have to test like capital one to succeed with direct marketing but testing and measuring will help you market effectively and with confidence and itll tell us who you really want to see retired new tax strategy reference libraryedward a lyon jd ctc the taxcoach planning system offers over  onepage strategy modules on taxsaving concepts and strategies like s corporations
