and return  as investment managers our goal is to help clients meet their longterm investment goals by growing assets and preserving capital  to that end we offer clients separately managed us

investment process which is rooted in fundamental analysis  our focus is on long term investments in companies with sustainable earnings growth and strong financial characteristics the fixed income investment philosophy is based on our belief that active management of highquality domestic fixed income securities will outperform the market over an economic cycle  we believe that “spread” sectors
