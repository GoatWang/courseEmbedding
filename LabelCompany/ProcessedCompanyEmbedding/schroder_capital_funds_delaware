received   logo schroders schroder emerging markets fund semiannual report november   schroder capital funds delaware schroder emerging markets fund account information   fund literature   investment objective the investment objective of the fund is to seek longterm capital appreciation investment adviser schroder capital management international inc the investment adviser is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of schroders plc the london stock exchange listed holding company parent of an investment banking and investment management group of companies the schroder group that dates its origins to  the investment management operations of the schroder group are located in  countries worldwide including  offices in emerging markets the schroder group has been managing international investment portfolios since the early years of this century as of june   the schroder group had over  billion in assets under management as of september   the investment adviser together with its uk affiliate schroder capital management international ltd had approximately  billion under management of which approximately  billion was invested in dedicated emerging markets mandates january   dear shareholder we are pleased to present the semiannual report for the schroder emerging markets fund for the six months ended november   this past six months saw markedly divergent performance among the worlds markets as well as considerable volatility of performance within certain individual emerging markets a common theme was investors rising level of risk aversion in response to economic and financial shocks including russian debt default and increased devaluation risk in some emerging markets in general in the first half of the fiscal year economic problems appeared largely contained within asia and parts of the broader emerging markets universe in the last fiscal quarter the turmoil in the emerging markets spread to european and the us markets and these markets also experienced some volatility looking forward we expect global growth to be slower in  than it was in  as the contagion from emerging markets continues to weigh on demand in developed markets we believe that this will trim but not eradicate growth in continental europe latin america is likely to be one of the emerging market regions where growth is likely to slow most sharply next year within asia which experienced a very sharp contraction in  we believe that activity may be stabilizing but further structural reforms especially within the banking sector are needed to sustain a significant recovery on a more positive note monetary authorities like the federal reserve and its global counterparts were quick to act to forestall future problems by lowering interest rates a growing number of companies including many in asia are increasing their emphasis on shareholder value this should help to ease investors anxieties and to trim the risk premiums that have risen in many markets although we believe that it is unlikely to return them to levels seen earlier in the fiscal year schroder emerging markets fund we expect further uncertainty and volatility in the year ahead nevertheless compelling values exist in many emerging equity markets after this years correction and many high quality stocks have been sold indiscriminately we believe that as investors once again focus on the attractive value now available and on the longterm potential for restructuring and improved profitability we will see a revival of interest in emerging markets schroders investment approach stresses the rewards of identifying high quality franchises with sustainable growth prospects at attractive valuations the present environment presents great scope for our extensive global research network to identify such opportunities for the longterm benefit of our investors thank you for your interest in the schroder emerging markets fund sincerely s m j smith mark j smith president  schroder emerging markets fund management discussion and analysis as of november   unaudited performance for the six month period ended november   the schroder emerging markets fund returned  its benchmark the morgan stanley capital international emerging markets free excluding malaysia index returned  over the same period country allocation contributed positively to the funds performance over the period specifically an overweight position in korea and eastern europe and an underweight position in the troubled brazilian and russian markets stock selection on the whole detracted from performance the fund invests in larger companies with solid longterm fundamentals and it was these more liquid stocks that suffered dramatic selloffs in the last six months as investors fled the emerging markets stock selection in taiwan and thailand contributed positively to performance and in poland our underweight position in banks benefited the fund market background the rolling crisis in emerging markets which began with the devaluation of the thai baht in mid has since spread to russia latin america and brazil as currency and economic expansion concerns gradually became global investors became increasingly risk averse capital was withdrawn international lending and borrowing declined and many economies in the asset class stalled or contracted greece and portugal were least affected by the turbulence as their economies were supported by falling inflation and low interest rates both countries also benefited from their forthcoming participation in european monetary union emu portugal in  greece in  the crisis in russia impacted other countries in eastern europe resulting in a decline in investor sentiment latin americas current account balances came under pressure as a result of falling commodity prices and this was exacerbated by a downturn in capital inflows september was a particularly volatile month for global markets mainly due to brazils huge budget deficits however emerging markets enjoyed a strong recovery in october and november a series of interest rate cuts by the us federal reserve reduced currency pressures in many emerging markets triggering a market rally the rally continued through november as brazil announced a fiscal adjustment and a  billion imf aid package in europe and the mediterranean however countries such as israel and turkey experienced reduced capital flows for the first time portfolio review given the weakness in emerging stock markets we maintained a defensive position throughout the six month period we held unusually high levels of cash reducing our cash position in early october as confidence in emerging markets recovered we focused on markets in which economic fundamentals remained strong such as poland hungary and mediterranean europe and on those countries most committed to restructuring in particular we favored korea it was already showing signs of corporate restructuring and bank recapitalization its interest rates had fallen sharply and its currency was relatively stable we were underweight in countries with weak economic fundamentals such as brazil and south africa at the height of the crisis in august we purchased usdenominated bonds in korea mexico and argentina as a further defensive measure we also hedged the funds exposure to the hong kong dollar the polish zloty and the brazilian real in the midst of these unsettled market conditions we focused on companies with strong balance sheets and sustainable cash flows such as china telecom and korea electric power  schroder emerging markets fund management discussion and analysis unaudited concluded outlook looking ahead we favor emerging mediterranean europe and africa and asia over latin america we believe that weaker commodity prices and lower capital flows into emerging markets will hit latin america particularly hard due to its huge current account deficits whereas some asian companies  and most companies in emerging mediterranean europe  will start to see a recovery in  in particular we favor the prospects for korea however we believe that further restructuring and bank recapitalization is key to the future direction of its stock market while the outlook for emerging markets has improved we still have a number of concerns commodity prices in emerging markets remain weak global growth is expected to slow in  and the capital available for emerging market companies and governments is scarce we believe that brazil is key to the future of emerging markets with continued progress on fiscal reform and lower interest rates essential if it is to avoid internal debt restructuring on a more positive note emerging market companies are trading at a significant discount relative to their developed market peers at the moment representing what we believe to be great opportunities for longterm investors the views expressed in this report were those of the funds portfolio manager as of november   and may not reflect the views of the portfolio manager on the date this report is first published or any time thereafter these views are intended to assist shareholders of the fund in understanding their investment in
