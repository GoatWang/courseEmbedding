releases scientific conferences newsletter company overview diffusion pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage company focused on improving the effectiveness of standardofcare therapies for lifethreatening treatmentresistant solid cancerous tumors without adding harmful side effects   the company is developing its lead drug trans sodium crocetinate tsc which has received orphan drug designation from the fda for use in a number of cancers in which tumor hypoxia oxygen deprivation diminishes the efficacy of current treatments tsc targets the cancer’s hypoxic microenvironment reoxygenating treatmentresistant tissue and making the cancerous cells more vulnerable to the therapeutic effects of conventional radiation and chemotherapy   the company is poised to begin a pivotal phase  trial in glioblastoma gbm other programs include clinical trials in pancreatic cancer and brain metastases because tsc’s novel mechanism safely reoxygenates a wide range of tumor types its use is not limited to a specific tumor tissue but has the potential to treat numerous lifethreatening cancers diffusion pharmaceuticals inc  technology overview technologytechnology overview scientific papers newspress releases scientific conferences newsletter technology overview oxygen deprivation at the cellular level “hypoxia” is the result of rapid tumor growth causing the tumor to outgrow its blood supply cancerous tumor cells actually thrive on hypoxia as the resultant changes in the tumor microenvironment confer “treatment resistance” to radiation and chemotherapy treatments within the hypoxic cancerous cell mechanism of action tsc’s unique reoxygenation capabilities derive from its novel mechanism of action promoting enhanced diffusion of oxygen through the blood plasma and into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment click to enlarge image click to enlarge image oxygen levels of normal tissue remain unaffected thereby avoiding the introduction of additional harmful side effects disruption of the treatmentresistance syndrome by reoxygenation promotes enhanced cancer killing power from standard radiation and chemotherapy treatments thereby safely extending survival diffusion

diffusion a phenomenon that forms the basis for the companys name tsc and other oxygen diffusionenhancing compounds including bipolar trans carotenoid salts the subclass to which tsc belongs have been investigated by diffusion pharmaceuticals for treatment of conditions associated with reduced oxygen availability in tissues hypoxia research activitiesedit entrance to diffusion pharmaceuticals laboratories gainer invented the concept of oxygen diffusionenhancing compounds and its specific embodiment tsc while a professor of chemical engineering at the university of virginia he secured the first patent on the molecule and its uses in  before tscs invention he and colleagues conducted research on the effects of oxygen diffusionenhancing compounds in various animal disease models including atherosclerosis arthritis and cancer at that time crocetin a naturally occurring carotenoid compound was the focus of their research with the invention of tsc their research turned to the potential use of this synthetic oxygen diffusionenhancing compound for the improved treatment of hemorrhagic shock shock caused by the loss of a large volume of blood on the battlefield this research which was supported financially by the united states office of naval research onr was conducted in gainer’s university of virginia laboratory following the companys formation by kalergis and gainer in

personalized medicine share tweet link email print phrma’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies in a new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc in fact research has shown nearly twothirds of nslcs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers like dr zeiher  percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized while the

the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news
