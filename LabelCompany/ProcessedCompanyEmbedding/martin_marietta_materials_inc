leading to an overall increase of  compared with the prioryear period the powerful combination of increasing aggregates volume and pricing growth along with quarterly record net sales for specialty products resulted in record consolidated net sales of  million based on our performance through the first half of the year and key economic indicators we are raising our fullyear aggregates product line volume guidance to a range of  to  over  levels employment growth an important driver of construction activity has been clearly evident in many of our key states and contributed to the continued expansion in private construction activity we were also pleased to see greater stability in publicsector construction activity with certain martin marietta markets experiencing substantial growth we view this level of activity as an indicator of strong underlying demand and expect further growth in the infrastructure market once funding stability is restored we are encouraged by the bipartisan support for renewing longterm investment in the countrys infrastructure system as demonstrated by congress recent actions mr nye continued we are enthusiastic about the prospects for our recent successfully completed acquisition of texas industries inc txi which was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders of both companies and closed in early july the acquisition provides a broader platform

 additionally earlier this year colorado approved its first publicprivate partnership project which will renovate and expand the us  corridor the current federal highway bill moving ahead for progress

refinancing is expected to reduce interest expense by  million on an annual basis based on current interest rates as compared with txis financing costs fullyear outlook the company is encouraged by various positive trends in its business and markets notably nonresidential construction is expected to grow in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors shale development and related followon public and private construction activities are anticipated to remain strong the commercial building sector is expected to benefit from improved market fundamentals such as higher occupancies and rents strengthened property values and increased real estate lending residential construction should continue to grow driven by historically low levels of construction activity over the previous several years together with low mortgage rates higher multifamily rental rates and rising housing prices total annual housing starts are anticipated to exceed one million units for the first time since  for the public sector authorized highway funding from map should increase slightly compared with  additionally state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects are expected to grow and continue to play an expanded role in publicsector activity based on these trends and expectations the company anticipates the following which excludes the impact of the txi acquisition heritage aggregates enduse markets compared to  levels infrastructure shipments to increase slightly nonresidential shipments to increase in the high single digits residential shipments to experience doubledigit growth and chemrockrail shipments to increase in the midtohigh single digits heritage aggregates product line shipments to increase by  to  compared with  levels heritage aggregates product line pricing to

and  million generating  million to  million of gross profit interest expense to remain relatively flat compared with  estimated effective income tax rate to approximate  excluding discrete events capital expenditures to approximate  million mr nye concluded this is an exciting time for martin marietta we continue to see numerous positive indicators that underpin our confidence in the momentum and growth trajectory of our business additionally our strategic acquisition of txi enhanced our ability to benefit from the significant levels of construction activity in texas and california as we integrate the txi operations and begin realizing expected synergies we will remain focused on further improving our balance sheet and increasing our financial flexibility which should lead to opportunities for additional value creation for our shareholders risks to outlook the fullyear outlook includes managements assessment of the likelihood of certain risk factors that will affect performance the most significant risks to the companys  performance will be congress actions and timing surrounding the expiration of map and uncertainty over the funding mechanism for the highway trust fund further additional government shutdowns and the impact of the patient protection and affordable care act may further erode consumer confidence which may negatively impact investment in construction projects while both map and the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act tifia credit assistance are excluded from the us debt ceiling limit this issue may have a significant impact on the economy and consequently construction activity other risks related to the corporations future performance include but are not limited to both price and volume and include a recurrence of widespread decline in aggregates volume negatively affecting aggregates price the termination capping andor reduction of the federal andor state gasoline taxes or other revenue related to infrastructure construction a significant change in the funding patterns for traditional federal state andor local infrastructure projects a reduction in defense spending and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases a decline in nonresidential construction a decline in energyrelated drilling activity resulting from certain regulatory or economic factors a slowdown in the residential construction recovery or some combination thereof a reduction in economic activity in the companys midwest states resulting from reduced funding levels provided by the agricultural act of  and declining coal traffic on the railroads and the possibility that expected synergies and operating efficiencies in connection with the txi acquisition are not realized within the expected timeframes or at all further increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability if these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past construction spending could be reduced north carolina a state that disproportionately affects the companys revenue and profitability is among the states experiencing these fiscal pressures although recent statistics indicate that transportation and tax revenues are increasing the specialty products business essentially runs at capacity therefore any unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment the companys principal business serves customers in aggregatesrelated construction markets this concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables however payment bonds normally posted on public projects together with lien rights on private projects help to mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables the level of aggregates demand in the companys enduse markets production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the aggregates business and therefore profitability production costs in the aggregates business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices both directly and indirectly diesel fuel and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energyrelated input costs such as steel explosives tires and conveyor belts fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs primarily through fuel surcharges in the companys longhaul distribution network the specialty products business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization and the absolute price and fluctuations in the cost of natural gas transportation in the companys longhaul network particularly the supply of rail cars and locomotive power to move trains affects the companys ability to efficiently transport material into certain markets most notably texas florida and the gulf coast the availability of trucks and drivers to transport the companys product particularly in markets experiencing increased demand due to energysector activity is also a risk the aggregates business is also subject to weatherrelated risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability the first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather hurricane activity in the atlantic ocean and gulf coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters risks to the outlook also include shipment declines as a result of economic events beyond the companys control in addition to the impact on nonresidential and residential construction the company is exposed to risk in its estimated outlook from credit markets and the availability of and interest cost related to its debt the companys future performance is also exposed to risks from tax reform at the federal and state levels conference call information the company will discuss its second quarter  earnings results on a conference
