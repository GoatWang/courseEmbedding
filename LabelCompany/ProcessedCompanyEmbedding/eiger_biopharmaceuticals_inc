managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of eigers financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in part i item  of this quarterly report on form q eigers consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended december   included in our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on march   this discussion and other parts of this report contain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations intentions and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere in this report forwardlooking statements this quarterly report contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing to market novel product candidates for the treatment of orphan diseases since our founding in  we have worked with investigators at stanford university and evaluated a number of potential development candidates from pharmaceutical companies to comprise a pipeline of novel product candidates our resulting pipeline includes four phase  candidates addressing four distinct orphan diseases the programs have several aspects in common the disease targets represent conditions of high medical need which are inadequately treated by current standard of care the therapeutic approaches are supported by an understanding of disease biology and mechanism as elucidated by our academic research relationships prior clinical experience with the product candidates guides an understanding of safety and the development paths leverage the experience and capabilities of our experienced commercially focused management team the pipeline includes lonafarnib for hepatitis delta virus or hdv lambda for hdv exendin  for postbariatric hypoglycemia or pbh and ubenimex for pulmonary arterial hypertension or pah and lymphedema we plan to deliver data from all ongoing phase  clinical trials over the course of the next eighteen months as illustrated in the following table we have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales we have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each year since inception and we do not anticipate that we will achieve profitability in the near term our net losses were  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of  million substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we initiate and continue the clinical development of and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and add personnel necessary to operate as a public company with an advanced clinical candidate pipeline of products in addition we are now operating as a publicly traded company following the reverse merger with celladon and we will be hiring additional financial and other personnel upgrading our financial information systems and incurring costs associated with operating as a public company we expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval merger with celladon on march   we completed the reverse merger between private eiger and celladon in accordance with the terms of the agreement and plan of merger dated as of november   by and among private eiger celladon and celladon merger sub inc or the merger also on march   in connection with and prior to the completion of the merger we effected a fifteen for one reverse stock split of our common stock or the reverse stock split and changed our name to eiger biopharmaceuticals inc on november   in connection with the merger we entered into a subscription agreement or the subscription agreement with investors for the sale of shares of our common stock or the private placement which closed on march   immediately prior to and in connection with the merger each share of private eigers preferred stock outstanding was converted into shares of private eigers common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock for each share of preferred stock under the terms of the merger agreement at the effective time of the merger celladon issued shares of common stock to private eiger stockholders at an exchange ratio of approximately  shares of common stock after taking into account the reverse stock split in exchange for each share of private eigers common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger the exchange ratio was calculated by a formula that was determined through armslength negotiations between celladon and private eiger immediately after the merger the former private eiger equity holders beneficially owned approximately  of postmerger eigers common stock the merger was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition financial operations overview research and development expenses research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research and development such as the development of our product candidates we recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred research and development expenses consist primarily of the following expenses incurred under agreements with consultants and clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of clinical trials contract manufacturing expenses primarily for the production of clinical supplies license fees associated with our license agreements and internal costs that are associated with activities performed by our research and development organization and generally benefit multiple programs these costs are not separately allocated by product candidate unallocated internal research and development costs consist primarily of personnel costs which include salaries benefits and stockbased compensation expense allocated facilities and other expenses which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation expense and regulatory expenses and technology license fees related to development activities the largest component of our operating expenses has historically been the investment in research and development activities however we do not allocate internal research and development costs such as salaries benefits stockbased compensation expense and indirect costs to product candidates on a programspecific basis the following table shows our research and development expenses for the three months ended march   and  in thousands three months ended march    product candidates lonafarnib hdv     lambda hdv   exendin  pbh   ubenimex pah   ubenimex lymphedema   internal research and development costs   total research and development expense     we expect research and development expenses will increase in the future as we advance our product candidates into and through later stage clinical trials and pursue regulatory approvals which will require a significant investment in regulatory support and contract manufacturing and clinical trial material related costs in addition we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire or inlicense other product candidates and technologies which may result in higher research and development expenses due to license fee andor milestone payments the process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming we may never succeed in timely developing and achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates the probability of success of our product candidates may be affected by numerous factors including clinical data competition intellectual property rights manufacturing capability and commercial viability as a result we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs allocated expenses and expenses for outside professional services including legal audit accounting services and investor relations personnel costs consist of salaries benefits and stockbased compensation allocated expenses consist of facilities and other expenses which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities depreciation expense and other supplies during the three month ended march   we incurred incremental expenses as a result of the merger as a result of becoming a public company following completion of the merger expenses include costs related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the sec and nasdaq additional insurance investor relations banking fees and other administrative expenses and professional services interest expense interest expense for the three months ended march   consists of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in november  and then converted into common stock in march  or the notes interest expense for the three months ended march   consists of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to the oxford loan and related borrowing in december  interest income interest income consists of interests earned on our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents other expense net other expense net for the three months ended march   consists of the change in fair value of the obligation to issue common stock to eiccose and the change in fair value of warrant liability the change in fair value of the obligation to issue common stock to eiccose was related to our obligation to issue shares to eiccose upon the closing of the next round of financing that resulted in at least  million in gross proceeds to us upon the closing of the private placement on march   we issued to eiccose  fully vested shares of our common stock in settlement of this obligation in connection with this transaction we remeasured the fair value of the obligation to issue common stock at the settlement date and the change in fair value of  million was recognized within other expense net during the three months ended march   upon the settlement of the obligation with the issuance of shares on march   the liability was reclassified to common stock and additional paidin capital within stockholders equity in connection with our issuance of the notes we issued warrants to the noteholders to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of  per share on a postmerger and postreverse stock split basis or the warrants the number of shares into which the warrants could be exercised was equal to the warrant coverage amount divided by the per share price of the equity securities sold in a qualified financing and thus was accounted for as a liability upon the closing of the private placement on march   the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants was fixed and the fair value remeasured at that date and the warrants were automatically exercised during the three months ended march   we recognized a loss related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability of  million the warrant liability was reclassified to common stock and additional paidin capital within stockholders equity upon the exercise of the warrants and issuance of shares on march   critical accounting policies and estimates our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ materially from these estimates we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving managements judgments and estimates there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended march   as compared to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   results of operations comparison of the three months ended march   and  three months ended march      change change operating expenses research and development         general and administrative       total operating expenses    loss from

increased by  million to  million for the three months ended march   from  million for the same period in  the increase was primarily due to a  million increase in clinical expenditures due to increased program activity a  million increase in compensation and personnel related expenses due to an increase in headcount and a  million increase in consulting fees related to increased program activity general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by  million to  million for the three months ended march   from  million for the same period in  the decrease was primarily due to a  million decrease in legal consulting advisory and accounting services incurred related to the merger in the first quarter  the decrease was partially offset by a  million increase in stockbased compensation expense and a  million increase in compensation and personnel related expenses due to an increase in headcount and a  million increase in facility and insurance

the change in fair value of warrant liability that were settled upon the merger there were no such expense during the three months ended march   liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of march   we had  million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of  million we believe that the currently available resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next  months following the issuance date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses including research and development expenditures and general and administrative expenditures cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses as reflected in the change in outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses future funding requirements we have not generated any revenue from product sales we do not know when or if we will generate any revenue from product sales we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any of our product candidates at the same time we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development and manufacturing activities particularly as we continue the research development manufacture and clinical trials of and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates our primary uses of capital are and we expect will continue to be funding research efforts and the development of our product candidates compensation and related expenses hiring additional staff including clinical scientific operational financial and management personnel and costs associated with operating as a public company we expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates we plan to continue to fund losses from operations and capital funding needs through future equity andor debt financings as well as potential additional collaborations or strategic partnerships with other companies the sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in additional dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we can provide no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us if at all if we are not able to secure adequate additional funding we may be forced to delay make reductions in spending extend payment terms with suppliers liquidate assets where possible andor suspend or curtail planned programs any of these actions could materially harm our

new way to fight cancer share tweet link email print it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer but what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry for more information download the phrma

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news mustknow facts about drug costs did you know due to negotiation and competition medicine costs are growing at the
