along with six other third party defendants the lawsuit has been brought in the circuit court of the sixteenth judicial circuit in kane county illinois the lawsuit in the lawsuit the county of kane the county alleges that bb enterprises andor blackberry creek development corporation collectively bb are responsible for the relocation of approximately twentythree power poles at an alleged cost of  alternatively the county alleges that either bond or commonwealth edison company comed is responsible for the cost of the pole relocation on november   bond filed an answer denying the countys allegations and has pled five affirmative defenses the affirmative defenses generally allege that the bond did not cover the pole relocation that only one pole needs to be relocated at significantly less cost and alternatively that comed is responsible for any pole relocation costs as alternative relief bond filed a counterclaim against bb and comed and a third party complaint against the partnership and four individuals the individuals contending that if bond is deemed responsible for or settles the countys allegations then bb the partnership andor the individuals bear some or all of this responsibility under a general agreement of indemnity bond also seeks its attorneys fees based on such general agreement of indemnity on february   the partnership filed an answer and affirmative defenses denying the material allegations asserted by bond bond has not replied to the affirmative defenses the county has served discovery requests to bb bond and comed bond has served discovery requests on the county the county has produced a limited amount of documents and provided interrogatory responses to bond which have been provided to us comed produced limited documents and responses in march  and produced additional documents in june  following entry of a protective order the countys counsel previously informed counsel for the other parties that between five and eight of the poles at issue have been moved by comed as part of a different project thus these poles were not expected to be a continued issue in this case in october  the countys counsel informed counsel for the other parties that seven of these poles were only partially removed by comed as part of the different project the county has not yet indicated whether it will pursue removal of these seven partial poles as part of this lawsuit thus the number of poles at issue remains under investigation and may be subject to further dispute the investigation of the claims and defenses in the lawsuit is ongoing it is not possible at this time to evaluate the likelihood of an outcome for this same reason any effort to estimate the range of potential loss is limited other than  based on a judgment in favor of

be derived through leases to farmers or from other activities compatible with undeveloped land although the general partner believes that leasing our land will generate sufficient revenues to pay these expenses there can be no assurance that this will in fact occur our general partner has agreed to make a supplemental capital contribution to us if and to the extent that real estate taxes and insurance payable with respect to our land during a given year exceed the revenue earned by us from leasing our land during such year any supplemental capital contribution will be repaid only after limited partners have received over the life of our partnership a return of their original capital plus the  cumulative return a majority of the parcels purchased by us consist of land which generates

constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal private securities litigation reform act of  these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements these factors include among other things the ability to obtain annexation and zoning approvals required to develop our properties the approval of local governing bodies to develop our properties successful lobbying of local no growth or limited development homeowner groups adverse changes in real estate financing and general economic or local conditions eminent domain proceedings changes in the environmental conditions or changes in the environmental positions of governmental bodies and potential conflicts of interest between us and our affiliates including our general partner critical accounting policies on december   the securities and exchange commission issued financial reporting release or frr no  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that would materially affect our operations or financial condition and requires management to make estimates or judgements in certain circumstances we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to how we value our investment properties and mortgage loans receivable and revenue recognition these judgements often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the purpose of the frr is to provide investors with an understanding of how management forms these policies critical accounting policies discussed in this section are not to be confused with accounting principles and methods disclosed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates the following disclosure discusses judgements known to management pertaining to trends events or uncertainties known which were taken into consideration upon the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions valuation of investment properties  on a quarterly basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no  we conduct an impairment analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each property does not exceed its estimated fair value if this were to occur we would be required to record an impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value in determining the value of an investment property and whether the property is impaired management considers several factors such as projected capital expenditures and sales prices the aforementioned factors are considered by management in determining the value of any particular property the value of any particular property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain factors either individually or taken as a whole should the actual results differ from managements judgement the valuation could be negatively or positively affected the valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on managements continuous process of analyzing each property for the year ended december   we had recorded no such impairment cost allocation  we use the area method of cost allocation which approximates the relative sales method of cost allocation whereby a per acre price is used as the standard allocation method for land purchases and sales the total cost of the parcel is divided by the total number of acres to arrive at a per acre price  valuation of mortgage loans receivable  on a quarterly basis we conduct an analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each mortgage loan receivable is recoverable from the borrower if we determine all or a portion of the receivable is not collectible we would be required to record an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the amount estimated to be uncollectible in determining the value of mortgage loans receivable management considers projected sales proceeds available and expenses related to the property associated with the mortgage should the actual results differ from managements judgement the valuation could be negatively or positively affected the valuation and possible subsequent allowance for doubtful accounts is a significant estimate that can and does change based on managements continuous process of analyzing each mortgage loan receivable as of december   the partnership has evaluated the mortgage loans receivables and recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  on one of the mortgage loans receivable revenue recognition  we recognize income from the sale of land parcels in accordance with statement of financial

rezoning and other activities such amounts have been capitalized and are included in investment properties our capital needs and resources will vary depending upon a number of factors including the extent to which we conduct rezoning and other activities relating to utility access the installation of roads subdivision andor annexation of land to a municipality changes in real estate taxes affecting our land and the amount of revenue received from leasing as of december   we own in whole or in part  parcels the majority of which are leased to local tenants and are generating sufficient cash flow from leases to cover property taxes and insurance we continue to market the remaining acres for sale at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  which is available to be used for our

contracts on portions of parcel  undistributed net sales proceeds will be used to cover our operations including property upgrades we will evaluate our cash needs throughout the year to determine future distributions we plan to enhance the value of our land through predevelopment activities such as rezoning annexation and land planning we have already been successful in or are in the process of predevelopment activity on several of our land investments parcel  has been granted rezoning which will permit additional land to be useable for development we are in zoning and planning

of the approximately  acres owned  acres are tillable leased to local farmers and generate sufficient cash flow to cover property taxes insurance and other miscellaneous expenses rental income was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively rental income continues to decrease due to a decrease in the tillable acres as a result of sales professional services to affiliates were   and

website land operating expenses to nonaffiliates were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively these costs primarily include real estate tax expense ground maintenance and insurance expense on the parcels owned and decrease as acres are sold we determined that the maximum value of parcel  could be realized if the parcel was developed and sold as individual lots however if we had followed that plan there is a possibility that it could have increased income taxes therefore we sold the parcel to a third party developer whereby  of the sales price was represented by a note receivable from the buyer this transaction was deemed an installment sale after the sale the developer through a limited liability company or llc secured third party financing to cover the deferred down payment owed to us as well as provide proceeds to begin the development of the project this sale was structured so that the deferred down payment received at the time of the sale was sufficient to provide a distribution to our limited partners that equated to the parcel capital allocated to the parcel plus approximately a  return per annum on the capital invested in the parcel parcel capital through the date of the distribution  the velocity of the developers individual home sales was slower than was originally projected and consequently the developers carrying costs were higher as a result of the slower lot sales the net sale proceeds available to us are lower than anticipated as of december   and  we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  relating to the mortgage receivable and accrued interest respectively relating to the sale of parcel  and have written off the related deferred gain of  our general partner guaranteed the third party development loans owed by the llc in reviewing the developments financial situation our general partner determined that it would be in its best interest to have an affiliate acquire the interest in the limited liability company the general partner and its affiliates concluded that they could better control the continuing costs to complete the development and would therefore have the best opportunity to limit their exposure under the guarantee agreements and possibly recover a portion of the amount owed an affiliate of our general partner contributed approximately  to acquire the interests in these llcs our general partner contributed approximately  to pay off the debt under its guarantee of the llc loans the affiliate of the general partner will complete the development and sale of this project we continue to monitor the developments financial situation our limited partners received distributions that equated to the parcel capital plus approximately a  return per annum on the parcel capital through the date of the distribution our partnership agreement our partnership agreement defines the allocation of profits and losses and available cash if and to the extent that real estate taxes and insurance payable with respect to our land during a given year exceed our revenues our general partner will make a supplemental capital contribution of such amount to us to ensure that we have sufficient funds to make such payments profits and losses from operations other than capital transactions will be allocated  to the limited partners and  to the general partner the net gain from sales of our properties is first allocated among the partners in proportion to the negative balances if any in their respective capital accounts thereafter except as provided below net gain is allocated to the general partner in an amount equal to the proceeds distributed to the general partner from such sale and the balance of any net gain is allocated to the limited partners if the amount of net gain realized from a sale is less than the amount of cash distributed to the general partner from such sale we will allocate income or gain to the general partner in an amount equal to the excess of the cash distributed to the general partner with respect to such sale as quickly as permitted by law any net loss from a sale will be allocated to the limited partners distributions of net sale proceeds will be allocated between the general partner and the limited partners based upon both an aggregate overall return to the limited partners and a separate return with respect to each parcel of land purchased by us as a general rule net sale proceeds will be distributed  to the limited partners and  to the general partner until the limited partners have received from net sale proceeds i a return of their original capital plus ii a noncompounded cumulative preferred return of  of their invested capital however with respect to each parcel of land the general partners  share will be subordinated until the limited partners receive a return of the original capital attributed to such parcel parcel capital plus a  per annum noncompounded cumulative preferred return thereon  after the amounts described in items i and ii above and any previously subordinated distributions to the general partner have been paid and the amount of any supplemental capital contributions have been repaid to the general partner subsequent distributions shall be paid  to the limited partners and  to the general partner without considering parcel capital if after all net sale proceeds have been distributed the general partner has received more than  of all net sale proceeds exclusive of distributions made to the limited partners to return their original capital the general partner shall contribute to us for distribution to the limited partners an amount equal to such excess any distributions from net sales proceeds at a time when invested capital is greater than zero shall be deemed applied first to reduction of such invested capital before application to payment of any deficiency in the  cumulative preferred return subsequent events on january   we sold  acres of parcel  for approximately  and
