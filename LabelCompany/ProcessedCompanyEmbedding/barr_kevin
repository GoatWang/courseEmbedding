what do our customers think rahner review  feb   this book by karl rahner especially the center section on christ is the best i have read on christian theology difficult exposition of catholic faith  nov   karl rahner is considered one of the leading catholic theologians of the th century rahner is interesting for several reasons particularly for his strongly apophatic approach to god this is reflected in this book where god is considered the ultimate mystery who is above all names obviously echoing pseudodionysiusrahners style is not the best or the most accessible and von balthasar and bernard lonergan are much easier to read even jacques maritain is somewhat easier to readrahner is not incomprehensible but the reader will find this work very difficult to read unless they have some background to rahners thought especially his extensive use of terms from existentialist and continental philosophy it remains one of his key works though and needs to be read by any student of rahner to understand his ideas set the controls for the heart of the son  sep   foundations of christian faith is a deceptive title for a book which is in fact an overview of the whole field of rahners catholic progressive theology and it is no easy read i gave an italian version to a doctor friend who gave up reading it after the first  pages because it was too difficult it is however compulsory reading for anyone interested in the perennial conflict within catholicism between a theology inspired by stthomasbased on aristotle and staugustinebased on plato the representative of this latter theology is the swiss theologian von balthasar who wrote his magisterial the glory of the lord in response to what he saw as rahners dilution of the concept of revelation amongst other things the current pope benedict xvi a major theologian himself is a firm supporter of von balthasars theology which makes rahner somewhat unpopular in vatican theological circles today rahner in contrast to the entire catholic approach to theology of the past  years does not start his understanding of christianity by elaborating upon the tenets of revealed faith but starts from below ie from mankind as a species which is open to the supernatural in its very essence and then goes on to show how faith fills this need or spiritual vacuum the point of conflict here is whether faith is inherent in human nature or is an act of grace a created spiritual reality which is granted to man but is not part of his natural constitution rahner amongst other things even opens out to eastern religious ideas by stating that purgatory might even be worked out over a series of successive reincarnations  something which clearly has the traditionalists tearing their hair out a further difficulty for the traditionalists is that he tries to make evolution an integral part of an aspect of his understanding of faith  here i think hes on shakier ground placing aany scientific theory as an integral part of theology exposes it to the risk of collapse should the theory prove over time to be false or is replaced by another theory look at what happened with galileo  anyone interested can read kuhns the structure of scientific revolutions rahners major works are currently out of print  so the foundation is indispensable reading if anyone wants to come to grips with one of the two giants of modern theology the other being von balthasari found this english translation to be excellent and its words have a very strong emotional as well as intellectual impact which is why i invested in a copy despite having an italian version one last thing rahners jesuit biblical training can clearly be felt behind every concept he develops there is always a nt scriptural root this is not stated explicitly so be sure you keep the nt firmly in mind when you read him this is the culmination of rahners life  sep   karl rahner is confounding to most people who only touch him and veer off looking for a more acceptable theology if you read the early rahner you will have difficulty if you read rahners last tome you will be treated to the fullness of his spiritual development william dych is the best english translator of rahner bar none in foundations     karl rahner lets down his guard and reveals to the reader who he has become in his lifetime he is no longer speaking about god but rather is telling the listener who god is there is still the extensive backgrounding and rambling german sentence structure but once you understand that this text like all of rahners published works was written from dictation you will begin to understand just what is missing from the printed word even though dych translates brilliantly and with great insight not even he can capture the characteristic vocal inflections that made the rambling sentences concise and clear the reader must supply the drama of the words understanding that not a word that was uttered has been left out of print thus karl rahner is not to be read so much as to be experienced and this will take some work but in this way the reader will suddenly discover what karl rahner in his persuasive and vastly diverse way is attempting to say this book is well worth hearing for those who have ears tough transcendental sledding  aug   rahners foundations is a long bumpy difficult ride the concepts are brilliant and challenging they undoubtedly illuminate the faith of christians and profoundly portray catholicism rahners mode of expression however is dense and difficult write your own review about foundations of
