in business as compared to only  of individual new startup businesses  us department of commerce franchising marketplace of the st century the opportunity the outlook for the franchise industry is that it will continue to grow in the coming years the opportunity has been born of the need for specialized and knowledgeable funding and development of developmental stage franchise product andor service concepts we believe there is an opportunity in the franchise marketplace for a franchise development firm such as francap to partner with either existing or prospective franchisors to build their franchise operations rather than charge large upfront or ongoing cash fees for franchise development services such as most other franchise consulting firms that currently operate in the marketplace today in addition we believe that meaningful investment support for aspiring franchisors has been almost entirely neglected until now it is this void that francap intends to fill by sourcing of capital investments to qualified startup andor established early stage businesses whose principals in concert with francaps management team believe a successful franchise product or service can be speedily developed packaged registered marketed and profitably managed value proposition the value proposition that francap offers to existing small established businesses that have the potential to become franchise operations and to existing early stage franchisors that have the potential to become large successful franchisors is to provide them with the franchise development expertise and capital sources that will enable them to potentially become large national brands the cost francaps compensation for providing its franchise development services is generally performance based in other words francap may derive its revenue primarily from a revenue sharing arrangement with the franchisor in exchange for providing the franchisor with francaps franchise development services in addition francap may also take a small equity position in the franchisor franchise targets francaps search for suitable franchise development opportunities is generally directed towards small and mediumsized enterprises which have the desire to develop and license their franchise rights typical franchise opportunity targets will i be development stage entities with established proof of concept ii be experiencing financial or operating difficulties or iii be in need of expertise and funds to develop a franchise system industry segments francap will primarily seek target opportunities in the following industry segments automotive business services commercial and residential services lodging personal services quick service restaurants tablefull service restaurants real

confident that the development of any selected franchise operation will be provided by some of the most experienced dedicated and scrupulous management and marketing team members in the franchise industry today why franchise why should i consider franchising my business there are many reasons to consider expanding your business through franchising however there are also other expansion strategies that you may want to consider by way of example you may decide to expand your business through the development of companyowned locations while this option may give you complete control over all of your operations the disadvantage of expanding through adding companyowned locations is that it usually requires a significant investment of capital time and other resources which can slow down the development process the advantage of expanding a business through franchising is that the franchisee puts up the money and other resources needed for the business this generally allows the business to expand and build its brand at a much faster rate businesses best suited to franchising not all businesses are suitable for expansion through franchising although many types of business concepts are potential candidates for franchising a successful franchise generally has some degree of distinctiveness or the potential to achieve distinctiveness in its business segment if it does not it will have difficulty attracting suitable franchisees in an increasingly competitive market for such persons a franchise may be distinctive in terms of its products services operations and delivery systems or marketing if a business is to be successfully expanded by franchising its success must be attributable to its products or services business format operating or management systems and marketing in addition the business must be teachable to prospective franchise buyers and must be easily replicable by such persons to be successful a franchised business must appeal to qualified franchise buyers and compare favorably with other franchises in the same market category the decision to franchise your business making the decision to expand an existing business through franchising can represent a watershed moment in the furtherance of your strategic business plan the first step in this process is to determine if your business is franchisable or not this generally involves the meeting with an experienced franchise development consultant to assess the potential to franchise your business concept however before a final decision is made by a prospective franchisor to go forward with developing a franchise program the franchise development consultant will typically recommend the preparation of a feasibility study to analyze the market potential completion brand awareness expansion potential and other relevant factors should the feasibility study indicate that developing a franchise program is a viable strategy for the expansion of the business the next step is to commence the franchise development process franchise development process the franchise development process developing a franchise program for a prospective franchisor typically involves working with numerous franchise professionals including a franchise attorney accountant franchise development consultant sales and marketing consultant and others depending on the complexity of the business and other factors the franchise development process can take anywhere from  to  months more or less to complete including closing the first sale of a franchise there are several phases of the franchise development process which are described in more detail below development and analysis of the franchise structure initial client meeting concept review onsite analysis prepare feasibility study develop franchise program structure preparation of franchise documentation draft franchise agreement prepare franchise disclosure document fdd file franchise registrations prepare operations manual marketing  sales prepare marketing plan design  build website design franchise brochure draft sales training manual prepare sales training program conduct sales training ongoing maintenance review operations conduct follow on training as needed conduct regular compliance reviews fine tune marketing strategy resolve miscellaneous issues as they arise exit strategies potential franchisor exit strategies there are several exit strategies that a franchisor may consider at the appropriate time including a merger or acquisition registration of the companys securities ie ipo mini ipo etc or other exit strategy to get the most money from the sale of the business the franchisor must anticipate that a potential buyer of the business will be requesting a great deal of due diligence information that will be needed to support the sale price of the business therefore it is never too early to start preparing for the due diligence process in order to be adequately prepared for a possible acquisition sale or registration of the franchisors securities the franchisor must start early and consider what information would be needed by the prospective buyer whether an institutional
