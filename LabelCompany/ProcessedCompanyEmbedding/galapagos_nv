object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

genetic disease that affects approximately  patients worldwide and approximately  patients in the united states cf is a chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system cf patients with significantly impaired quality of life have an average lifespan approximately  shorter than the population average with the median age of death at  there currently is no cure for cf cf patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications frequent hospitalizations and ultimately lung transplant which is lifeextending but not curative cf is caused by a mutation in the gene for the cftr protein which results in abnormal transport of chloride across cell membranes transport of chloride is required for effective hydration of epithelial surfaces in many organs of the body normal cftr channel moves chloride ions to outside of the cell mutant cftr channel does not move chloride ions causing sticky mucous to build up on the outside of the cell cftr dysfunction results in dehydration of dependent epithelial surfaces leading to damage of the affected tissues and subsequent disease such as lung disease malabsorption in the intestinal tract and pancreatic insufficiency  galapagos and abbvie entered into a global alliance to discover develop and commercialize novel therapies in cystic fibrosis cf in september  galapagos and abbvie aim to develop a triple cftr combination therapy to address  of patients with cf in order to bring a more effective therapy to patients the companies have developed multiple candidates and backups for each of the three components of a potential triple combination triple combinations of cf compounds in the portfolio have consistently shown restoration of healthy activity levels in in vitro assays with human bronchial epithelial hbe cells of patients with the fdel mutation these combinations result in a statistically significant increase in chloride transport over orkambi in hbe cells with the homozygous fdel mutation it is expected that a triple combination therapy patient study will start in   orkambi® is a prescription medicine sold by vertex pharmaceuticals used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis cf in patients age  years and older who have two copies of the fdel mutation fdelfdel in their cftr gene   related publications pharmacokinetics and safety of a novel cftr corrector molecule glpg in subjects with cystic
