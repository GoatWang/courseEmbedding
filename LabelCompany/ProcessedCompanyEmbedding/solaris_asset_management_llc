process portraiture plan development implementation reporting commentaries partner profile contact us home solaris asset management investment consulting and wealth management solaris advisors llc a whollyowned subsidiary of the solaris group llc is an independent secregistered wealth management and investment consultancy serving select global institutional and private clients market commentaries april  first quarter  capital markets overview the global markets’ positive momentum established in the th quarter  carried into the first seven weeks of the new year once again international markets led the way although in the most recent quarter the developed markets of europe and japan outperformed those of the emerging markets and both did better than the us stock market click here to read the entire commentary preserving capital enhancing returns the overriding tenet of our philosophy is to preserve capital and enhance its purchasing power our global private clients come to us with significant wealth sometimes with stocks that have low tax basis andor are highly concentrated usually earned by them or their forbearers by taking great risk they turn to us for stability in their investments and to steward these assets across generations we honor that trust by crafting investment programs that seek to protect capital while meeting longterm investment objectives our goal is to achieve an enhanced return net of fees annualized over market cycles our process in crafting investment consulting and wealth management solutions for our clients we utilize a fourphase process  portraiture  plan development and optimization  plan implementation  customized reporting phase  portraiture we begin by developing analyzing and discussing a picture of the clients intergenerational wealth plan tax situation global situs and current asset allocation we fully integrate a specific investment strategy into our clients wealth and tax planning we eschew formulistic questionnaires in favor of iterative dialog that is substantive and clientspecific thus our understanding of client objectives and their own definition of risk is broadbased and nuanced our document and portfolio review often uncovers unintended risks as well as significant variances between what the client believes to exist versus what really exists by reviewing the portfolio against the wealth plan we can more readily assess the likelihood that the clients goals will be achieved the result is a clear snapshot of the wealth plan and current array of assets phase  plan development and optimization we work with the family and its advisors to develop an investment plan that optimizes wealth in light of the clients specific objectives and constraints just as goals can be multiple and complex restrictions are typically varied and include document and situs issues tax considerations and client biases andor experiences asset allocaton is driven not only by our market view but also by client particulars and the nature of the entities we are managing we consider these specifics in light of our assumptions regarding the expected return volatility and correlations of various asset classes we then simulate ending wealth values including the clients projected cash flows the result is a powerful means of minimizing the possibility of failure while enhancing the likelihood of goal attainment we deliver to each client a set of guidelines that provide structure discipline and accountability to the investment program while allowing for some degree of flexibility phase  implementation while we are styleneutral over a market cycle we tactically over or underweight portfolios when we believe a sizeable investment opportunity exists that is likely to continue for some time current and prospective managers undergo a rigorous quantitative review including proprietary screening analysis of sample portfolios and return patterns in various environments importantly the metrics we use to assess managers are not uniform across styles and sectors the quantitative review is helpful in identifying prospective managers and tracking the progress of those selected but it is only the beginning it is a truism that performance numbers are old news and not likely to be repeated we strive to use our experience and intheknow information to ferret out those managers whose past success we believe is more likely to be repeated we are particularly interested in the competitive edge that each manager has and how that edge may be further honed or blunted we have a history of replacing managers about whom we have concerns even when their performance continues to be impressive phase  customized reporting our clients expect and deserve to understand the progress of their investment program we believe in accountability and know that effective selfanalysis is essential to ensure a positive dialog with our clients and to provide a basis for considering change attribution reporting can uncover the successes andor the shortcomings of an investment program in concert with our clients we create a series of blended benchmarks to isolate and capture the impact of our asset allocation style and sector weightings and manager selection beyond performance reporting we can provide a high degree of analytics on the total portfolio as well as the individual managers to whom we have awarded mandates additionally we can include transaction cash flow and taxrelated information in a format customized to client specification the report serves as a feedback loop that informs the entire wealth management process ralph d sinsheimer cofounder the solaris group oversees solaris advisors including strategic asset allocation manager selection and philanthropic services formerly

president and director of funds at loomis sayles  company asset allocation performed without regard for the unique circumstances of the client is suspect likewise socalled optimization tools that rely slavishly on the past cannot uncover catalysts of change we strive to be forwardlooking and to keep in front of significant events for the benefit of our clients contact us the solaris group llc the

exhibit the greatest potential for growth per unit of value across the spectrum of economic sectors and market capitalization in investment parlance we are a lowbeta highalpha allcap core manager   solaris asset management wins “allcap manager of the year” from emerging manager monthly magazine more invested in intellect expertise and manpower solaris asset management is a highly resourced domestic equity investment specialist whose primary goal is to deliver superior riskadjusted returns using the highest ethical standards our firm draws from the considerable experience of its staff which is organized along functional lines our investment team is composed of chief investment officer tim ghriskey and a group of sector managers fundamental and quantitative analysts traders and risk managers the investment function is supported by experienced operations administration legal compliance systems and client service personnel this significant depth of intellect expertise and manpower provides the infrastructure to support ongoing investment excellence even in the face of client and asset growth invested alongside our clients we will limit our growth when we believe we are approaching a size likely to inhibit future performance seizing opportunities protecting principal solaris believes that securities representing the greatest opportunity for appreciation are those exhibiting the most attractive future growth potential relative to current valuation therefore within prudent riskdiversification guidelines we are agnostic as to economic sector or company size our approach leads us to tilt a portfolios sector and market cap exposure based upon changes in corporate economic and financial market trends beyond seizing opportunities a primary tenet of our philosophy is to protect portfolio principal our risk management techniques include an eightstep sell discipline it is our view that thoughtful security sales are an indication of risk management vigilance changes in valuation or growth prospects are inevitable over time and require action we are particularly attentive to avoiding losses of significance in taxable portfolios we are mindful to offset or delay gains in order to reduce the tax burdens but we never allow tax sensitivity to dominate the investment decision a comprehensive process for security selection the solaris researchintensive approach to security selection focuses on company fundamentals our universe of investments includes over  companies that have an acceptable level of trading liquidity these companies are subjected to our proprietary multifactor computer model which assists our sector managers and analysts in identifying securities for further research we focus on some  companies that may have business issues which limit the realization of their growth potential the securities of these companies represent unrealized value in the financial markets we then identify those companies where we believe positive change is most likely to occur—typically about a hundred companies at any given time we look to understand core fundamentals we seek financial discipline strong and improving management and commitment to positive change we meet with corporate management attend conferences utilize wall street analysts interview industry experts read trade publications search the internet and closely scrutinize company fundamentals filings and reports this work culminates in an assessment of corporate earnings and cash flow forecasts and ultimately in a recommendation to invest our cio makes the final investment decision a balanced approach to portfolio construction solaris portfolios are constructed to offset the potential for inadvertent risk associated with a flexible stock selection approach portfolios generally have  to  securities which are typically equal weighted a position may be held at onehalf or two times the normal weight but only for a short period of time and for predetermined reasons in order to achieve an appropriate level of diversification at least seven out of ten economic sectors must be represented in the portfolio and no single sector can represent more than  percent of the portfolio while the method of valuation can differ by sector industry or security our portfolios generally exhibit characteristics consistent with our aim to find growth at a discount a valuationtogrowth ratio below that of the market and average forward earnings growth competitive with the market market commentaries april  first quarter  market review it was a volatile
