ensure you find a competent attorney who wont abuse your trust or drain your finances you have to make the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle the more forthcoming the lawyer

hellweg book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide a study was conducted to examine the evaluative criteria or schemata that voters use in making decisions about competing candidates more specifically the study sought to determine  whether the criteria that voters employ differ between the candidates and  the relative importance of various candidatespecific criteria in the voting decision process it was hypothesized that in contrast to the traditional view of a unitary voter decision process with one candidate compared to another using a general standard criterion for candidate acceptability there existed multiple criteria unique to each candidate as part of the evaluative process the  undergraduate students in the study were given  credibility scales to complete in response to the  united states presidential candidates jimmy carter and ronald reagan an ideality scale for each and a projected voter behavior scale data emerging from the research were submitted to factor analysis and discriminant analysis the results of the study supported the idea of unique criteria being employed in the evaluation of each individual candidate suggesting a more complex model of voting behavior than the traditional view previously advanced rl proceedings of the joint international tropical medicine meeting  by joint international
