pokemar  about sandridge mississippian sdt daniel r moore portfolio strategy bonds oil  gas longterm horizonfinancialrelativitycomsummarysdt pv report published on  shows a major  mboe reduction  yeartoyear due to well performancesince ipo the trust has reported a  reduction in reserves due to well performancecombined product mix changes due to lower oil production and continued well performance risk make these units unattractively overpriced at price levels above the  pvfor the second year in a row a major downward reserve adjustment was recorded at the sandridge mississippian trust i nysesdt on march   the trust published its k report which contained an updated standardized measure of proven reserves pv the updated report showed continued deterioration in reserves due to poor well performance as shown in the table below the total reported net reduction in proven reserves since the ipo of the trust in april of  is  mboe a loss of  of the estimated reserve level presented by sandridge energy nysesd to potential unitholders when capital was being raised to fund the trust but the loss of reserves is not the only issue plaguing the trust performance is also hindered by the change in the mix of resources being recovered or expected to be recovered in the future initially the trust was portrayed as having an oilgas mix of  through time the pv report has been adjusted to reflect the reality that the trust will deliver far less oil than expected instead delivering a higher concentration of far less valuable natural gas additionally the initial reserve reports ipo and  showed no indication of ngl in the production thus making the  report downward adjustments very steep as the mix change was introduced to investors along with well performance reductions as of  the reported reserve mix expected for the remaining life of the trust is  oilnglnatural gas the pv standardized measure per unit as of  fell to  on march   the trust units were trading at a value of  on the nyse  times the pv the price level of the units traded down sharply throughout  and early  as market participants adjusted expectations to the reality that the trust was far less valuable than portrayed in its initial sec filings the remainder of this report will focus on the current reported performance of the trust to provide information about whether the current traded unit value is reasonable investment or remains a pig in a poke quarterly distribution downward trend in  signaled pv adjustment the recently reported quarterly results by sandridge mississippian trust i showed a continuation of deteriorating production volume and poor earnings performance on january th sdt announced its quarterly distribution for production during the time period of september through november  during the fall the energy market showed relatively high oil prices throughout but weaker natural gas as oversupply in the market continued ngl prices began to improve during the period major improvements in natural gas and ngl prices are expected to be exhibited in the results that will be announced in the winter quarter may distribution in the context of a generally healthy energy market sdts common unit distribution of  was  below target overall earnings on a fully dilutive basis for the th quarter in a row could not cover the subordination threshold for the trust leaving the common units with a lower than threshold distribution subordinated unitholders continued to receive no distribution at all as the above graph shows sdts distribution level showed a steep decline in the recent quarter the severity of the decline is particularly troubling because the common unitholders continue to be protected by a subordination threshold that will expire after the next distribution the trust press release references lower sales volumes as the cause for the miss this statement is made relative to the trust ipo prospectus which projected a higher overall mboe production volume in both crude oil and natural gas than was eventually discovered sdt is on a course for constant  belowtarget results nearterm and even worse intermediateterm performance relative to its ipo distribution target levels as the subordination period expires in  sdt earnings performance analysis in the press release announcing the latest trust results management pointed to lower oil sales volume than the estimate in the ipo prospectus as the reason that the distribution target was missed the pv released on  in the trust k showed a continued decrease in mboe proven reserves of  yearoveryear during  due to well performance the degradation in results was exacerbated by a shift in product mix from  oil to  oil expected in the future the quickening pace of loss of oil production is to some extent a byproduct of horizontal drilling the output of shale wells drops faster too falling by  to  percent in the first year alone according to austin texasbased drillinginfo inc traditional wells take two years to fall by about  percent before flattening out sdt has no more wells which are being drilled therefore oil production loss can be expected to remain particularly acute in the coming quarters during the last quarter production volume was  mboe  lower than production in the juneaugust quarter the latest quarter distribution reflects septembernovember production the production level was down  compared to the same production quarter in  the drop in production can be linked to the completion of the drilling obligation may production quarteraugust distribution as shown in the graph below to the trust by the operating general partner sandridge a large number of the wells drilled by the operator for the trust appear to have resulted in initial highpressure output which subsequently declined rapidly resulting in poor well performance in addition to poor well performance the degradation in earnings performance is also directly linked to the decreasing percentage of liquids crude ngl in trust production drilling progress drilling was completed by sandridge in the spring of  the work was completed at an accelerated pace well ahead of the schedule set at the ipo based on the date that drilling was completed the subordination period will end beginning with the august distribution in  investors need to be aware of this date particularly since the trust is not earning enough currently to fully cover the subordination threshold based on the current earnings trend even if natural gas and ngl prices improve common unitholders will see a substantial drop in distribution level in the august distribution production mix analysis the pv published in the most recent sdt k made a major adjustment in the trust production mix as shown in the graph below the oil  gas mix was split into component oilnglgas parts during  the percentage of oil expected in the future results was lowered from  of production to  additionally the ngl portion of the mix was raised  to  while natural gas was lowered  to  the expected loss of oil production in the pv report had the highest impact on the overall pv value change in the graph above the natural gas and oil percentage mix over the last year is plotted to see if the trend line is actually matching the pv expectation the trend line is not a positive sign for investors the result in the previous two quarters was  oil gas the odd part about the reported results is that only  of total production in the latest september to november  results was ngl far lower than the published pv this means that it can be expected that oil production will fall very sharply in the near future displaced by a pickup in ngl production market  realized trust pricing trends in the graph below you can see the actual market prices for oil gas and ngl during the past year and the last production period pricing in the overall market was strong for oil production however the price of natural gas was in line with price levels experienced in the fall of last year the one bit of good news for trust unitholders is that when the futures price curve for natural gas is reviewed the current expectations are for a breakout above  natural gas through the next several years additionally in the upcoming distribution quarter which will be based on production volume in the winter months both ngl and natural gas prices showed sustained high levels which should be favorable for results the weighted average realized price for trust production during the fall of  was  per boe this is a  decrease over the  per boe realized in the prior quarter yearoveryear the realized price level declined  the minor declines in realized price levels at the trust can be attributed primarily to lower natural gas prices being offset by improving realized prices on ngl production as the differential tightened during the quarter effect of trust derivative contracts the trust has oil hedges in place for substantially all of its oil production at  through december of  it also carries hedges on approximately  of its natural gas volume the realized price levels for the latest quarter oil  gas  contain the benefit from the hedges adjusted for the differentials for delivery of production the trust forecasts a differential of approximately  in the oil price realized and the oil hedge price due to delivery basis risk the trust oil production is estimated to be  wti and  wts and the spread between the two products in the latest quarter was not substantial and should not have affected the realized price above normal expectations the  realized price level shows a return to more typical market conditions for product delivery the improvement in the realized price level for oil production reflects the improving price levels for ngl production the natural gas collar contract was supportive to the realized gas price during the latest quarter although a substantial amount of the production volume is not hedged if natural gas prices continue to go higher the realized price level at the trust will improve currently a  move up in gas prices is giving a  move up in realized average boe price levels the trust has no hedge contracts in place beyond december  presently the forward price curve for oil in the st production quarter of  shows an average price per barrel of  and  per mcf of natural gas the forward expectations for production sales price levels in the years beyond the current hedged production at the trust show risk in the oil price curve and generally high probability natural gas prices will rise above  per mcf these prices do not reflect the trustspecific negative differential for underlying product delivery as hedge expiration gets closer this risk will need to be continually monitored to adjust expectations pv updated in the trust k published in on march   the  yearend pv was supplied which showed a per share value of  this value reflects the expected cash flows from the remaining proven reserves held by the trust discounted at  the pv calculation uses constant price level assumptions for the life of the proven reserves as shown in the table below the table below reflects the yearly erosion of the pv due to depletion change in price levels used in the computation and the reduction in reserves due to ongoing well performance issues since april   mboe of the  reduction in mboe since the trust ipo or  can be attributed to actual production while the remaining  is due to well performance and production mix adjustments in total trust production depletion accounts for  of the proven reserve decline since ipo while well performancerelated reductions account for a  reduction relative to the ipo estimate overall price changes in the pv were more favorable than in  for oil and natural gas while ngl prices were lower the  pv report utilized a delivered price level of  per mboe for natural gas production which was an improvement from the  used in the calculation in  ngl pricing of  used in the pv was virtually the same in  as  expectations are that ngl price levels will likely recover to the historical  of crude price levels through time particularly once ngl exports begin to increase trust fair value estimation the pv is a static price level valuation model of proven reserves to incorporate the value of potential changes in price levels going forward as well as the value of the derivative contracts and the subordination threshold protection for common unitholders it is necessary to use a discounted cash flow valuation model the information contained below in this article is based on the valuation model i utilize to evaluate the fair market value of sdt the table below summarizes the information used in the model to derive a go forward distribution forecast when combined with the expected depletion of remaining proven reserves held by the trust the product price assumptions in the model use levels derived from the current forward price curve for oil and gas combined with the trust hedge contracts in place through the end of  the price forecast for wti crude oil for nymex delivery is shown in the graph below the out year price levels beyond the st quarter of  are grown at a rate of  annually up to a cap level which in this model are not reached before trust termination for natural gas and are reached in the last distribution period for oil ngl prices are assumed to be  of the traded price of oil and the percentage mix of ngl in production is raised to the pv expected level of  all prices are adjusted for delivery based on the average differential which is typically realized by the trust the model uses the production mix forecasted in the  pv of  oil  ngl and  natural gas when the price and mix assumptions are combined with the current proven reserves remaining at the trust and the expected production curve the distributions a unitholder can expect through the end of life of the trust can be forecast as shown in the graph below through the february  distribution the trust showed depletion of  of its proven reserves total remaining proven reserves are estimated at  mboe as of the start of the winter production period based on this model at the current price level of  on  the implied rate of return on the trust if bought and held to termination is  if you expect a  return a fair price level for an sdt common unit is  because of the poor track record of the trust and the elevated tail risk for a continued decline in reserves due to well performance that horizontally drilled wells are systemically exhibiting in the industry my fair market estimate at this time is  per unit which implies a  rate of return more consistent with the risk profile for this type of investment in general my opinion is that buying this asset at any price above the current pv continues to be a pig in a poke daniel moore is the author of the book theory of financial relativity investment
