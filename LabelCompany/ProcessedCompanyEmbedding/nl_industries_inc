statements are reasonable we cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct  such statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such forwardlooking statements  while it is not possible to identify all factors we continue to face many risks and uncertainties  among the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially include but are not limited to   · future supply and demand for our products · the extent of the dependence of certain of our businesses on certain market sectors · the cyclicality of our businesses such as kronos tio  operations · customer and producer inventory levels · unexpected or earlierthanexpected industry capacity expansion such as the tio  industry · changes in raw material and other operating costs such as ore zinc brass aluminum steel and energy costs and our ability to pass those costs on to our customers or offset them with reductions in other operating costs · changes in the availability of raw material such as ore · general global economic and political conditions such as changes in the level of gross domestic product in various regions of the world and the impact of such changes on demand for among other things tio  and component products · competitive products and substitute products · price and product competition from lowcost manufacturing sources such as china · customer and competitor strategies · potential consolidation of kronos competitors · potential consolidation of  kronos customers · the impact of pricing and production decisions · competitive technology positions · potential difficulties in integrating future acquisitions · potential difficulties in upgrading or implementing new accounting and manufacturing software systems such as kronos new enterprise resource planning system · the

timing and amounts of insurance recoveries · the extent to which our subsidiaries or affiliates were to become unable to pay us dividends · the ultimate outcome of income tax audits tax settlement initiatives or other tax matters · uncertainties associated with compxs development of new product features · our ability to utilize income tax attributes or changes in income tax rates related to such attributes the benefits of which may not have been recognized under the morelikelythannot recognition criteria    · environmental matters such as those requiring compliance with emission and discharge standards for existing and new facilities or new developments regarding environmental remediation at sites related to our former operations · government laws and regulations and possible changes therein such as changes in government regulations which might impose various obligations on former manufacturers of lead pigment and leadbased paint including us with respect to asserted
