halleffect sensors give a npn open collector current sinking output the output is a digital square wave alternating from zero to supply voltage we also have optional pnp open collector current sourcing sensors what value pullup resistor should i use with an electrosensors sensorall electrosensors products have an internal pullup resistor however if you are sending the pulses to a device without one you will need to supply one a suitable pullup resistor can be anywhere from a  kohm   kohms however be sure not to exceed ma on the sensor additionally ensure the resistor is rated for  of the expected maximum wattage it will dissipate at °c if using ¼ watt resistors good values are dc supply resistor in ohms  current watts dissipated  volts k   ma    mill watt  volts k  –  ma     mill watt  volts k  ma     mill watt what is the maximum working voltage and current my sensor can handleelectrosensors hall effect sensors can work up to  vdc at  ma maximum however we strongly recommend an operating current of less than  ma do i need a separate dc power supply to power the hall effect sensorwhen using the sensor with an electrosensors product speed switch tachometer etc no separate power supply is needed those products have a built in supply to power the sensor if not using with an electrosensors product check the specifications of that product can my sensor be used with an intrinsically safe barrieryes electrosensors hall effect magnetoresistive and digital ring kit sensors meet the requirements of intrinsically safe apparatus and associated apparatus for use in class i ii and iii division i hazardous classified locations ansiul   category   how do i test my sensor to make sure it is working properly electrosensors analog sensors models   can be tested by disconnecting the sensor from the electronics and connecting an ohmmeter to the black and clear wires a properly working sensor would have an ohm reading of approximately  ohms otherwise contact the factory for details electrosensors standard hall effect sensors models         and  require an electrical test please contact the factory for details do i need a two or three piece shaft monitoring system many applications are more suited to having the switch electronics and sensor right at the monitoring point a two piece system that way everything is calibrated right there other applications require the switch to be remotely mounted from the sensor and disc a three piece system space limitations environmental considerations and personal preference all play a part in determining the speed switch system required figure out what you need before installation begins it will save you time and money in the long term what type of sensor do i need for my applicationelectrosensors offers several different types of sensor housings to meet even the most demanding and diverse of application needs our standard aluminum body sensors will work in most applications but we also have explosion proof sensors and the choice of either stainless steel or pvc sensors for corrosive environments our explosion proof sensors are also a great choice for harsh environments such as rock quarries or mining applications where a rugged housing is required to protect the sensing head all of our sensors can be supplied with hightemp teflon cable if required for higher temperature applications what are my pulse generating optionselectrosensors offers a wide range of shaft end mount pulser discs and over shaft mount pulser wraps if the end of the shaft to be monitored is readily available then in many cases it makes sense to choose a pulser disc to generate pulses if the shaft end is not available then you can use a pulser wrap this is a custom made pulse generator that is a split collar that clamps around the shaft and installs in seconds over the years we have manufactured thousands of custom pulser discs and wraps and either way weve got you covered what is the difference between rpm range and relay set point rangemost of electrosensors speed switches can be used to monitor shafts that operate at speeds of up to  rpm the relay set point range however varies from switch to switch this range is where the relay will trip when a fault condition occurs the mt switch for example has an operating rpm range up to  rpm but a set point range of between  and  rpm when calibrated the relay will trip somewhere between these  and  rpm knowing the difference between operating rpm range and relay set point range will assist you and save time when specifying a switch for any speed

magnets alternating in polaritywhat type of ez should i be using for a high speed shaft moving in a counter clockwise directionthe aluminum ez disc part  is the best option for this situation with the aluminum option as opposed to the nylon you can tighten the disc up to  pounds or more with a lock washer and loctite this will greatly help to secure the disc to the shaft   faqs other what types of

isolated what if i need to return my product for creditrepair what types of sensor outputs can be interfaced with my electrosensors equipmentthe standard output being used with electrosensors equipment is npn open collector type however much of our equipment can be interfaced with other sensors that are not manufactured by electrosensors consult factory on specific equipment and sensor details or refer to product data sheets on this website how do i calculate frequency or hertz hzfrequency is measured in hertz hertz is the measure of pulses per second hertz is calculated using the following equation hertz  pprrpm where ppr  pulses per revolution rpm  revolutions per minute what is the maximum operating temperature for electrosensors productswhen specified our sensors discs and

isolated output isolator cards cvi for example may be purchased for other equipment what if i need to return my product for creditrepaircontact electrosensors inc for details and return policy at  all products being returned must have a return authorization number ra what is meant by a normally closed or normally open contact the way to think of a “normally” closed or open condition is  the state of the contacts when the relay is sitting on the shelf in the warehouse   that is their “normal” condition  when the system is operating correctly they “switch” and are kept that way by an electrical
