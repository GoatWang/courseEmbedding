to the rc retired gen john p abizaid former us centcom commander addresses an audience sunday night during the douglas county republicans we the peoplejohn abizaidprev of imagesnext retired gen john abizaid shared some light moments — as well as some serious ones — with a nearcapacity audience sunday night during the douglas county republicans we the people lincolnreagan dinner celebration at the carson valley inn abizaid a douglas county resident who served as us central command commander from  spoke on several topics during his president trumps global strategic challenges presentation in the valley ballroom im here to talk about our great country and about our armed forces im not a political person i am a soldier of the republic and i swore to support and defend the constitution of the united states abizaid said president trump has got his hands full … with a lot of things but im here to talk about those things that we as citizens ought to be worried about not so much worried about but we ought to be thinking about things that are important to us from a national security point of view he also expressed his belief that americans can be confident they are in good hands i want to point out that our members of the armed forces our elected officials our many people that are in the diplomatic services the cia or whatever we can all sleep well at night abizaid said we can pretend that the situation is going to get worse but it cant get too bad as long as we have good people with us i can assure you we really have good people with us and we have had ever since the formation of this great republic he also outlined some of the challenges facing trump you can hardly imagine a person whos got more responsibilities than that particular person abizaid said but hes also got a lot of assets and we need to think about those problems that are going to confront him as our chief executive he listed six points ■ china chinas a very important nation much bigger than we are its got a gross national product that will probably surpass us in a few years they are building their military might and theyre flexing their muscles in the south china sea abizaid said and while im not predicting we will go to war with them i am saying that we need to pay attention to what theyre doing and keep our armed forces strong so that we dont have to confront them in the distant future theyre a nuclear power theyre very capable they are worried about all sorts of different things but in particular they want to be a competitor to us and we should suspect in the years ahead that were going to have competition from them not war but competition we need to pay attention to who they are and what they do and in particular we need to pay attention to their naval buildup in the south china sea ■ north korea just the other day the north koreans launched a nuclear ballistic missile abizaid said its not really nuclear yet its capable of carrying a nuclear weapon perhaps were not quite sure but if they ever can get their technology to the point where they can put a nuclear weapon on that intercontinental ballistic missile then we all need to be nervous and we need to be nervous because if you havent paid attention to whos leading that country you should he then drew a laugh from the audience in talking about north koreas kim jongun very unpredictable has a bad haircut but dangerous … not only to us but to his own people i would say that in the days ahead probably sooner than later the president and his senior advisers and his military advisers will have to come up with courses of action to deal with that particular problem and do so knowing that the chinese may or may not want us to do whatever course of action we come up with ■ russia russia is an area of focus for abizaid in his current position as senior adviser to the ukrainian minister of defense the ukraine is fighting very hard against the russian separatists and its not just russian separatists that theyre fighting the russians are using their main force artillery units cyber capability electronic warfare and theyre being incredibly aggressive there we have been in support of the ukrainians giving them nonlethal aid in a way that allows us to bring our soldiers into western ukraine and train some of their battalions before they go into the combat area its hard to say where were going to head in this relationship with russia on one hand it makes sense to reach out to the russians and find a better path ahead but on the other hand it also makes sense to protect our nato allies and protect our friends in the region such as the ukrainians to the extent that we can ■ the middle east the middle east is his favorite part of the world abizaids grandparents immigrated from lebanon in the late th century and was himself a homestead scholar at the university of jordan in december i was visiting with some of my colleagues in kurdistan which is the northern part of iraq we were in the front line area with kurdish units and watching iraqi tank units go through on their way to mosul and unfortunately they were going in to liberate the most sunni of all the cities of iraq they were flying shia battle flags and they had iranian advisers on their tanks it was really a wakeup call for me weve been fighting over there many years and its far from over he addressed another major concern isis is a large muslim extremist movement that is ideological in nature and seen every muslim country we need to be able to defeat them on the battlefield in a couple of different places like raqqa and mosul but we need to understand beating isis causes the rest of the arab world and the sunni arab world in particular to ask the question now what for the rest of us and while we need to destroy the extremists with our military forces diplomatically we must continue to reach out to our sunni allies and friends in the region in a way that will allow them to have a better chance for a better future if we dont do that this ideological trend will never be destroyed ■ the north atlantic treaty organization the organization is a subject president trump brought up during the  election campaign our european friends as our president says are not meeting their obligations with regard to how much theyre paying for their common defense of nato but we need to reach out to them theyre still our allies and friends we need to reach out to them and encourage them to meet their obligations and make sure that they understand we are with them in this alliance that has been indispensable to us for so long and will continue to be indispensable to us he said ■ nuclear weapon concerns weve got to work a way to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons he said weve got work a way to defeat statesponsored cyber terrorism which is unfortunately coming from everywhere in particular russia and china probably the gravest threat to our national defense is sequestration and the continued squandering of resources of national defense by not giving our military enough resources to do their job ill be the first to say that our military needs to do some reform itself we spend too much on highticket weapons programs were not as efficient as we should be with the taxpayers dollars but on the other hand we cant have an army thats too small for its mission which we have today we cant have a navy with not enough ships it will take years to bring our armed forces back to the strength that they need to be in order to keep the country safe and to me thats the number one challenge the president faces abizaid began and ended his presentation by talking about the troops who serve in the us military ive probably said enough about all the potential hot spots and troubles … and im still smiling abizaid said im smiling because i know the young people that defend our country they wear the uniform they swear an oath of allegiance to the constitution they never let one another down theyre prepared to do whatever the president tells them to do they are ready to fight for their country wherever that may be theyre serving all over the world in places you can hardly imagine and they never let us down join the conversation view and add comments » a facebook account is required recommended stories for you trending in news fire reported in pine nut mountainspreacher fire prompts

 the national defense panel review of the  quadrennial defense review by united states book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide the consensus conclusion of the report is that there is a growing gap between the strategic objectives the us military is expected to achieve and the resources required to do so the effectiveness of americas other tools for global influence such as diplomacy and economic engagement are critically intertwined with and dependent upon the perceived strength presence and commitment of us armed forces yet the capabilities and capacities rightly called for in the  quadrennial defense review clearly exceed the budget resources made available to the department this gap is disturbing if not dangerous in light of the fact that global threats and challenges are rising including a troubling pattern of territorial assertiveness and regional intimidation on chinas part the recent aggression of russia in ukraine nuclear

policy by henry l stimson center book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide few recent national security developments have been as controversial as the increased us reliance on unmanned aerial vehicles uavs more colloquially known as drones while uavs have multiple peaceful and commercial applications heated debates about the use of lethal uav strikes away from traditional territorially bounded battlefields have tended to crowd out a broader and more nuanced discussion of us uav policy this report represents a preliminary effort to offer analysis and recommendations that could help shape and guide us uav policy going forward it looks at the military and national security benefits of uav technologies analyzes our current approaches to uav development and export and seeks to contextualize the strategic questions relating to the use of lethal uavs outside traditional battlefields ultimately it offers eight detailed recommendations for overhauling uav strategy improving oversight accountability and transparency developing forwardlooking international norms relating to the use of lethal force in nontraditional settings and

troops to somalia and is preparing for the possibility of sending still more to the former yugoslavia peacekeeping once thought to be the province of smaller nations now is a major concern for the army this paper examines the unique peacekeeping environment and identifies the special training requirements for military forces while the authors do not advocate the fulltime training of specialized peacekeeping units they recognize the need to change the mindset of deploying soldiers from combat to peacekeeping and adequately preparing staffs for such duty the authors recommend a common sense

the military team that will carry out the administration’s new iraq strategy bush administration officials said january   abizaids departure was expected it is anticipated he will be replaced by admiral william j fallon who is the top american military officer in the pacific officials said  the changes are being made as the white house is considering an option to increase american combat power in baghdad by five brigades as well as adding two battalions of reinforcements to the volatile province of anbar in western iraq the bush administration said  however both abizaid and gen george

arabamerican in us history but he is also the leading edge of a new generation while both tommy r franks and jay garner were blooded as young officers in vietnam abizaid  graduated from west point in  just as the us withdrew from that war he learned his trade instead in brushfires around the world in lebanon grenada and bosnia and in northern iraq in  where he worked for garner a tvsavvy briefer whose grenada exploits using a hotwired bulldozer under fire were fictionalized in a  clint eastwood movie called heartbreak ridge abizaid has been the subject of countless flattering newspaper profiles  the kind of attention that can derail a career in the fervently selfeffacing army but if he has enemies theyre keeping quiet said retired army col robert killebrew he is one of the very few emerging army personalities about whom one only hears good things yet abizaid has hardly shunned risks as a young officer he left the elite rangers to take a military scholarship at the university of jordan during his officially academic tour in amman abizaid strayed off campus to train with jordanian commandos and travel in the middle east including thenobscure iraq where saddam hussein was rising to power said killebrew abizaid bucked the usual assignment ladder and became an arabic specialist at a time when that wasnt always a good career move purely because he intellectually believed the army would need arabic specialists well he was right abizaids investment paid off in  when he joined the united nations monitoring mission in his ancestral lebanon he had a tremendous reputation recalled another lebanon peacekeeper retired marine col gary anderson and got along well with palestinians lebanese and israelis abizaid brought the same diplomacy to northern iraq in  when he peacefully eased iraqi regulars out of kurdish areas once by bombarding them with loud rock music he returned to the region this january when he was named one of two deputies to franks who  managing  other countries in his theater of operations  is likely to delegate daytoday work on postwar iraq to abizaid mideast specialist though he is abizaid is also at home in the pentagon his last assignment before central command was as director of the joint staff an obscure but powerful backoffice position charged with coordinating the army air force navy and marines in a letter leaked last fall abizaid

  loading every american soldier wants as much public support as he can possibly have thats the soldiers on duty in iraq and thats me as well we fight better knowing that our people back home support us back us and understand what were doing its hugely important john abizaid home patriotism support but the truth of the matter is that there is there is an opportunity for them to participate in the economic and political future of the country and certainly in the security life of the country john abizaid life future truth so these political activities will create friction in and of themselves and in this environment of friction therell be additional violence john abizaid political violence create well the reports are correct that were conducting very robust military operations on the afghan side of the border in areas where we think alqaida is operating and taliban remnants are john abizaid military think border certainly our goal is to leave iraq but we cant leave iraq with our forces until we know that the iraqi security forces are capable and efficient enough to defend the sovereignty of the nation john abizaid goal security know i think you also understand that one of the key things thats got to be done in iraq is to build a mentality of understanding that the military needs to be subordinate to civilian control and respectful of its own people john abizaid control people military in other words for every  enemy you kill you bring on  new recruits to their anticoalition cause then essentially you are working against yourself john abizaid words enemy yourself nobodys more mindful of the sacrifices of our troops than those of us that command them john abizaid more nobody us the power to prevent violence is a power that no police force seems to have anywhere in the united states john abizaid power police violence i dont believe iran is a suicide state john abizaid suicide believe state and so i think that if the person has the funds the network and the equipment to do this and also the experience which is the key factor then they can be quite deadly john abizaid experience think key capturing any member of any terrorist cell or any insurgent cell that we may happen to come across is always very very valuable and the thing that interests me is that in most instances after a time people talk and they tell us what they know john abizaid time know people well the hardest thing to do as we know from our own experience on  is protect everything all the time john abizaid time experience know but all that having been said you cant in a city of a million people like karbala or  million like baghdad you cant be in all places at all times john abizaid city people you our forces will not be on the sidelines john abizaid will our forces being on the run having to change the way that you do business being unable to plan in a safe and secure environment always looking over your shoulder knowing that some day somebodys going to knock on your door and its going to be your last john abizaid change business day i think you will see a lot of strains develop in the political process that will result in violence everywhere in the country  but its controllable its workable and it will lead to a much better future for these people john abizaid future political violence you know as well as i do that counterinsurgency is a very nuanced type of military operation john abizaid know military you i think what actually works best is locallevel individual targeting of key leadership nodes john abizaid leadership best think morale is good troops are confident leaders are capable john abizaid good morale leaders everybody needs to understand that i learned arabic from the united states army as a second language i never spoke it at home john abizaid home language army but my arabic is pretty good its good enough to have conversations with people to understand what they say to understand what theyre feeling john abizaid good people they say you dont build a new power plant in the united states overnight it takes years to build john abizaid power plant you clearly the secretary of defense my boss would like nothing better than to get osama bin laden and to get to ensure the complete defeat of alqaida because we know that alqaida is planning operations against the united states even as we speak here john abizaid planning boss speak but i am satisfied that the information that we have that this is the work of zarqawi is accurate john abizaid work i am information as far as zarqawi is concerned there is a network of extremists its
