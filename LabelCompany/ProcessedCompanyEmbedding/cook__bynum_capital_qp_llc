domestic and foreign businesses we do not artificially constrain ourselves by style boxes or other arbitrary factors instead we are opportunistic we will go anywhere we can find value across geographic regions industry sectors and market capitalizations this pure value investing philosophy has been heavily influenced by the teachings of benjamin graham john burr williams warren buffett and charles munger among others to minimize the risk of permanent capital loss and maximize longterm returns we make our investment selections using the following core criteria circle of competence we only invest in businesses whose core economics and future prospects we can understand and reliably predict we know our ability to recognize our limitations will be as important as our ability to execute competencies business we seek to invest in companies that have durable competitive advantages that allow them to produce predictable cash flows and earn high returns on equity for extended periods of time without sustainable competitive advantages a company’s results will be difficult to effectively forecast people we invest in companies whose management teams are capable and trustworthy think and act like shareholders employ conservative balance sheet and other accounting policies and make wise capital allocation decisions the risk of permanent capital loss can be lowered significantly if we only invest in businesses whose managers view shareholders as partners price we seek to invest in companies whose shares are trading at significant discounts to our estimate of their intrinsic values as this “margin of safety” serves to both prevent permanent capital loss when we make mistakes and also provide outsized returns when we are correct we use fundamental bottomup research to carefully assess whether an individual company meets these core criteria this research often includes but is not limited to review and analysis of company filings discussions with management visits to company facilities and conversations with the company’s customers competitors and suppliers when a company appropriately satisfies the first three of these criteria circle of competence business and people we will value it by projecting the future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and then discounting these ‘‘owner earnings’’ into presentvalue dollars using an appropriate interest rate we will only buy a company’s security only as long as it is trading at a large discount to our conservative appraisal of its intrinsic value learn more about why we

insight into our philosophy and the key tenets that have consistently underpinned our investment approach which have remained unchanged since our founding these excerpts are not allencompassing though they should provide a clear sense of how we think and to our application of a value investing philosophy as pioneered by  among others  ben graham warren buffett and charlie munger increasing our odds as the new lindley investment reflects our mandate i is focused on finding attractive investments onebyone and ii affords us the flexibility to invest capital only when we think an investment is truly compelling on an absolute basis we assess individual investment opportunities based on our estimate of their expected returns and the likelihood that the underlying businesses will perform close to our expectations for them a new investment in latin america based in lima corporación lindley sa bottles distributes and markets soft drinks fruit juices water sports drinks and concentrate in peru the company has the exclusive rights to produce cocacola products in the country including inca kola which is the topselling carbonated drink with a  market share cocacola is a strong  we have followed the business for some time and since the fall of  we have visited peru three times to meet management and to survey execution at the point of sale this research suggested that execution could be improved and that certain parts of the business needed more investment thoughts on walmart  our trip to south africa we have been interested in investment opportunities in africa for several years while there are certainly many challenges the potential to reach a large young and growing population should yield some attractive opportunities over time as a starting point for better understanding consumers in africa richard spent ten days in south africa meeting with the management teams of several interesting companies as well as visiting a variety of stores he returned very impressed with management at one company in particular and we hope that we will get the chance to buy this business or one or two others that richard visited when appropriate margins of safety are present observations from south america  western europe one of the main reasons to visit a country is to observe firsthand the facts on the ground another is to talk to people doing business there who are not primarily reading the englishlanguage media which means that they often have viewpoints that diverge from ours both practices broaden our perspective and give us a worldview that is closer to reality the mystery of the missing goods a number of recent news accounts have highlighted the increasing scarcity of basic foodstuffs and hygienic products in venezuela  the situation which will likely be worse by the time you receive this letter is a direct result of a series of government policies that are having dire consequences for the country recency bias global interest rates and return expectations as we demonstrated in our last letter the rate of return of an asset is inversely related to its price that is as the asset’s price goes up its future rate of return falls so inevitably at the very time that recent positive returns trigger a feeling of safety because one’s expectation for future returns is growing the opposite is actually happening risk rises as actual future longterm returns decline the inverse is true as well incentive misalignment in the money management business the benchmark index is by definition fully invested so inherent in this incentive structure is also the pressure to be fully invested particularly in a market that has recently risen this pressure is greatest at precisely the wrong time expensive securities offer low expected returns and a high risk of permanent capital loss but a manager’s perception of career risk – even if merely subconscious – can cloud his assessment of value and weaken his discipline price matters the math of investing is not difficult and can be done with a little division and some basic algebra but the math is essential buying and selling securities without a fluent understanding of how intrinsic value is calculated is mere speculation determining intrinsic value we have written extensively in the past about the centrality of intrinsic value in our investment process a company’s stock price can sometimes diverge widely from its intrinsic value which ben graham explained thusly “in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine” what to build or buy in today’s opportunity set based on the historic real rates of return of  and adding inflation expectations of  longterm nominal rates of returns on assets are adequate in the  range historically we have used those assumptions as a base and then insisted on a margin of safety by buying assets at a substantial discount to their intrinsic values our goal with this approach is to earn positive returns even when we make mistakes and achieve outsized returns ie above  when we are correct an investment with a prospective return in the  range has been our minimum satisfactory expectation ie a hurdle rate before we will put capital at risk the virtue of inactivity we have heard many variants on this theme from munger and others over the years and yet it remains one of the least appreciated aspects of investing really great investment opportunities are rare and our job is to recognize them when they occur and to avoid putting capital in harm’s way in their absence focus on the customer’s decision because the size and duration of cash flows are ultimately a function of a company’s competitive advantages our core emphasis as investors is on correctly assessing the sustainability of these advantages we believe a critical aspect of this analysis is to understand why a company’s customer makes the decision he does and whether he is likely to repeat that decision research trips in eastern europe greece  turkey we have been fortunate to cover a lot of ground in the last four months we took trips to england in march and in may spent three weeks driving through central and eastern europe in late may and early june and recently returned from a multiweek trip to greece and turkey during the first half of july the mind of a value investor the human condition is such that investors are rarely deficient in arrogance but humility in decision making tends to be in short supply we are relentlessly trying to impose a system of checks in an effort to resist this negative natural propensity including constantly challenging the assumptions key to every current and potential holding walmart de mexico postmortem we have seldom seen a company with competitive advantages as big as those walmex enjoys – larger than even the advantages walmart us had over its domestic competitors in  the combination of exceptional operations the accumulated knowledge of best practices a deeper management team and superior access to capital makes walmex truly an extraordinary business and to us perhaps the finest large company in the world nonetheless at the current price we no longer feel that the company trades at an adequate discount to our appraisal of its intrinsic value which regrettably leads us to sell the business einstein cern and the limitations of models ultimately our models are necessarily inadequate at describing reality so we spend time thinking through their limitations to avoid mistakes we continuously contemplate and discuss how the individual businesses that constitute the fund’s portfolio are positioned for the unexpected following einstein’s example we hypothesize what would alter our expectations for a business and we recognize that our valuations are just theories not certainties overpriced markets we do not think it is unreasonable to expect the fund to underperform in runaway markets and make up for that underperformance in other types of markets an overpriced market is a substantial risk to a longterm investor as deploying capital at high pricetovalue ensures mediocre longterm performance arca dissecting an investment as a way of further elucidating our investment approach we wanted to illustrate the research and investment process for one of our major holdings embotelladoras arca sab de cv commitment bias any honest postmortem of the investment decisions we have made at cook  bynum over the past nearly ten years will reveal plenty of mistakes we have made mistakes because we lacked perfect information we have made mistakes because we improperly processed the information we did have avoiding the loser and the “too hard” pile shortterm quotational changes in the value of a business do not concern us we do however spend a significant amount of time thinking about how we might suffer permanent capital loss in a holding as this type of loss is a major obstacle to longterm investment success the importance of price one of our four guiding principles of investing is to be disciplined about the price we pay for any security our circle of competence includes many businesses that possess attractive durable competitive advantages and that are run by capable management however unless the market offers bargain prices we cannot build in the appropriate margin of safety your capital deserves when deployed  post mortem when we think about our goals at cook  bynum we are not trying to earn a certain return or accumulate a certain amount of assets rather we are trying simply to execute well a pure concentrated value investing philosophy on whatever assets we have under management and given whatever opportunities the market presents at that point expanding our geographic circle of competence we can magnify our informational and decisionmaking edge in such places because a large percentage of western managers and investment banks simply refuse to bother with such places many that do invest are not doing the type of ontheground work that we think gives us an advantage the less sophisticated the market participants and the more difficult the research the greater the likelihood that we can identify good businesses trading at irrationally low prices pricing power and the potential impact of inflation the recent shifts in monetary and fiscal policy in many of the world’s largest economies have made it timely to discuss the effects of inflation on intrinsic value pricing power is a key factor to predicting how a business will perform in an inflationary environment greedy when others are fearful the first quarter of  saw continued turmoil and fallout from the bursting of the housing bubble the broadbased decline of virtually all equity markets around the world continues to present us with attractive buying opportunities making disciplined allocation decisions we put little stock in our ability to predict when either the economy or the market will turn around but our lack of leverage and stable of quality businesses give us the liberty to wait and just as importantly because we own quality businesses we expect that the fund will both avoid permanent capital loss and earn an acceptable return when the market begins to recognize the intrinsic value of our holdings we suspect the returns from holding equity securities in general will be more than satisfactory over the next  years from these levels “invert always invert” the great th century mathematician carl jacobi was fond of saying that when you encounter a tough problem “invert always invert” this principle has applications in many fields not the least of which is investing the purpose of investing is to make money using jacobi’s principle we ask the question “how do we not lose money” the danger of leverage as value investors we make the assumption that the market is irrationally pricing a security now and we expect the market to value the same security more rationally in the future what does a “moat” look like we often talk about a “moat” around a business a moat is a sustainable competitive advantage that allows a business to earn outsized returns on capital over time and allows us to better predict the future prospects of a business we could not buy businesses with conviction without a moat the psychology of errors an important differentiator between our selection process and the processes of the value managers we respect is the time and effort we spend on analyzing how psychological factors affect decision making a number of different factors cause people to systematically make mistakes in judgement geometric means kelly criterion etc we continuously have indepth discussions surrounding the purchase or sale of a given security but there exists another equally important problem for the investor – how to allocate capital between competing qualifying ideas it is not good enough to simply say “this is an undervalued business with a high margin of safety “real” risk we are often asked to discuss our investment philosophy as it relates to our expected longterm returns many people making investment decisions today at very large sophisticated institutions believe that an investment is less risky if it has a smooth progression of returns month after month and year after year when “mr market” frets opportunity knocks diligence when adding new capital is imperative to ensure that existing partners are not diluted out of sizable positions in businesses that we currently own we have been quite fortunate to acquire new positions and to add to most of our previouslyheld positions during periods of growth margin of safety we are actively looking for more investments that meet our qualitative criteria of good businesses with a sustainable competitive advantage and with talented honest management if these qualitative criteria were our only concern we would have dozens of qualifying investment ideas however price is essential to our process learn

philosophy why the arch building our portfolio why are we different how we think bookshelf building our portfolio establishing and sizing positions we typically build concentrated positions in equity securities as we prefer to invest more capital in our best ideas recognizing that bigger stakes can be taken when information is adequate and outcomes are more certain  our assessment of the attractiveness of each potential investment is informed by our deep research shaped by our requirement of a ‘margin of safety’ and driven by the strict application of our core criteria among other considerations  this approach reflects our desire to make investments only when we feel that risk is low and potential returns are high  consistent with our longrange investment horizon we define risk as the probability that a business performs materially worse than we predict leading to a permanent loss of capital rather than a temporary decrease in the quoted price of a stock  we specifically reject the concept that price volatility is a form of risk and instead consider it our friend – an opportunity to either buy a business cheaply or sell it dearly  in fact because we anticipate being a large net purchaser of companies for the foreseeable future we welcome low and declining prices to build positions – even in positions we currently hold  we are only concerned with the intrinsic value of the businesses in which we invest  stagnant or declining prices in the face of solid business performance are simply an opportunity to own a greater proportion of the future profits of a business   the position size of and concentration in each of our ideas are influenced by the kelly criterion  our main takeaway from kelly is that a position’s size should be a function of both the security’s expected return and its potential range of outcomes such that although the math cannot be done explicitly in investing it implies two critical points when thinking about how big a position should be in a portfolio with the first point being more obvious than the second i     the larger the expected return the bigger the position should be and ii    the larger the possible range of outcomes the smaller the position should be as absolute value investors we are comfortable holding cash and equivalents in the absence of compelling opportunities that meet our minimum hurdle rate requirements  it is our obligation to not put our partners’ capital in harm’s way without the prospect of an adequate return and cash allows us to act quickly in volatile andor falling markets  we are staunch adherents to the belief that the avenue to superior returns is being “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful”  this investment strategy may not be the best way to earn high returns in any given year but we believe it yields a portfolio that avoids the permanent capital losses endemic to shortterm strategies and earns the highest cumulative returns over a  year time horizon selling positions while our longterm approach typically produces low turnover and extended holding periods we will generally sell a security under the following conditions »  we will begin to liquidate an investment when it appreciates to the point that it approaches or moves beyond our estimate of its intrinsic value  an investment reaching our appraisal may have further upside potential but it will no longer offer an appropriate margin of safety for putting capital at risk »  we will also sell any investment that has a material adverse change in business management or return prospects since we invested  negative developments by themselves do not necessarily trigger the selling of a position but should an event lower our appraisal enough or prevent us from reliably appraising the intrinsic value of the investment we will sell it  positive events may cause us to adjust our appraisal of value upwards  we appraise our positions on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the investment »  based on opportunity cost considerations we will generally sell relatively overpriced securities to buy relatively underpriced securities as these specific opportunities arise  this situation happens most often in times of market dislocations or disruptions learn more why are we different cook  bynum capital qp llc birmingham al   cortera company profile cortera
