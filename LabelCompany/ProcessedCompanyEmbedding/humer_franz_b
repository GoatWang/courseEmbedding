costs on the breakthrough therapy we need to make a decent rate of return on our innovations… i cant imagine a society that doesnt want that innovation to continue he told the associated press march   he promised that roche would give discounts to governmentrun programs and even provide the drug free in some cases humer committed roche resources to the fight against aids in october  he met with the united nations secretarygeneral kofi annan and officials from several other drug companies to help poor countries get improved access to aids drugs but he said supplying free medicine was not enough in countries that lacked the infrastructure to disseminate and use them properly more training and governmental commitment would be needed before the drugs could be effective vision for the future humer said that he saw a wave of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry that one day would enable doctors to identify the right patients for the right medication at the right dose at the right time

■ as chairman and chief executive officer ceo of roche group franz b humer led the swiss pharmaceutical company through a number of financial ups and downs and a controversial pricefixing case through all of the changes humer never compromised the familyowned businesss solidarity refusing even to discuss the possibility of a merger with other large pharmaceutical companies in  in the midst of a significant economic and company downturn humer sold all nonpharmaceutical divisions he strengthened the companys researchanddevelopment arm and bolstered its new and core drug offerings humer always tried to balance his financial responsibilities to his shareholders with his ethical responsibilities to the millions of people who use roches drugs education and early career humer received his doctorate in law from the university of innsbruch in austria then went on to earn an mba from insead in fontainbleau france he learned survival skills and developed an innate sense of human behavior while in his s working as a tour guide for large groups there was no salary only tips pretty soon i could hone in on particular groups eventually i could predict within  how much i could earn from any particular group he told harvard business review september   humer began his career in  with icme international in zurich switzerland two years later he entered the pharmaceutical industry joining schering plough corporation as assistant to the vice president for europe africa and the middle east after leaving schering plough humer held various managerial positions including director at glaxo holding he was responsible for research business development manufacturing commercial strategy and all operations outside the united states moving to roche humer joined roche in  as a member of the board of directors of roche holding and as the head of its pharmaceuticals division in  he assumed the role of roches ceo in the late s a time when several other pharmaceutical companies were merging roche remained staunchly independent humer said that although he was not completely opposed to the idea of a merger he was confident that his company could succeed alone by simply focusing on its internal products and by marketing new drugs one of the biggest new drugs roche marketed was a weightloss medication called xenical which gained approval from the us food and drug administration in  worldwide sales exceeded  million and xenical became one of the most profitable roche products since valium in  humer became chairman of roche he kept a tight rein on the company and its employees according to industry insiders which led to some disagreements with other roche executives in may  humer fired chief financial officer anton affentranger after just four months of service because of a reported personality clash humer vows to keep roche independent in  roche lost  billion dollars the greatest annual loss in the companys year history humer blamed the drop on investment losses and on a multimillion dollar fine that stemmed from a s vitamin pricefixing case in  rumors had begun to circulate that rival swiss drug manufacturer novartis was moving toward a merger with the familyowned roche novartis purchased  percent of roches stock and then steadily increased its stake humer quickly dismissed the idea remaining firmly opposed to any such megamerger large mergers large acquisitions in this industry destroy value destroy innovation he said mit news release even when novartis increased its roche holdings to  percent in  just below the level that the swiss law considers a formal bid humer was unfazed he was so unconcerned in fact that even amid rumors that his company was about to be swallowed up by novartis humer went skiing he said he was secure in knowing that the two roche owners the hoffmann and oeris families would never relinquish control over their company but humer had no trouble drawing other companies under roches wing in fact he wanted to create additional value for roches shareholders by changing the companys focus through strategic acquisitions in order for the company to focus on its diagnostics and pharmaceutical businesses humer bought a controlling stake in the japanese pharmaceutical company chugai in  and he acquired diagnostics company igen international for  billion in  he then rid the company of its less profitable chemicals business and sold its vitamins division to the dutch company dsm although roche was still responsible for all liabilities stemming from the pricefixing case roche also purchased a majority stake in the californiabased biotech company genentech profits and responsibilities humer said that one of his greatest challenges in running a large pharmaceutical company was balancing the companys fiscal and moral responsibilities the biggest challenge for us is how to cure the sick and run a profitable business at the same time he told students at the massachusetts institute of technology mit news release in mid the two goals seemed at odds controversy developed when roche released its new aids drug fuzeon the drug had a yearly price tag for users of  which was three times the cost of the most expensive aids drug then on the market aids activists protested that the drug was too expensive for the average patient to afford but humer defended the companys pricing saying that it needed to recoup its researchanddevelopment costs on the breakthrough therapy we need to make a decent rate of return on our innovations… i cant imagine a society that doesnt want that innovation to continue he told the associated press march   he promised that roche would give discounts to governmentrun programs and even provide the drug free in some cases humer committed roche resources to the fight against aids in october  he met with the united nations secretarygeneral kofi annan and officials from several other drug companies to help poor countries get improved access to aids drugs but he said supplying free medicine was not enough in countries that lacked the infrastructure to disseminate and use them properly more training and governmental commitment would be needed before the drugs could be effective vision for the future humer said that he saw a wave of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry that one day would enable doctors to identify the right patients for the right medication at the right dose at the right time american way march   under humers leadership roche has spent about  billion a year on research and development when you look at what drives the success of pharmaceutical companies its clearly driven by the ability to innovate and the capacity to create new products he told businessweek online by  roche had bounced back from its financial troubles operating profits had increased by  percent and the company went from a net loss of about  billion in  to a net income of almost  billion the following year the increase was due primarily to
