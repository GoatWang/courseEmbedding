hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers ascs in targeted regional markets in the southeastern united states we currently have three majorityowned hospitals consolidated hospitals in texas we have seven minorityowned ascs located in texas pennsylvania new jersey maryland and ohio in addition to our ownership interests we provide management services under contract to most of our minorityowned facilities finally we have a legacy business that provides sleep testing management services our strategy is to create a regional network of highquality yet cost effective surgical facilities that meet the needs of patients physicians and payors we believe our facilities provide a friendly and convenient environment for our patients to receive high quality care we operate our facilities structure our strategic relationships and adopt staffing scheduling and clinical systems and protocols with the goal of increasing physician productivity and satisfaction in light of the efficiency of our facilities we believe we are competitively positioned among payors to generate good clinical outcomes while containing costs our commitment to the needs of all relevant parties coupled with the strong growth dynamics of our markets lead us to believe that the number of procedures performed at our facilities each year will increase going concern and managements plan as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of  million and a working capital deficit of  million adjusted for redemption payments of  million payable to preferred noncontrolling interest holders in october  during the six months ended june   we generated a net loss attributable to foundation healthcare common stock of  million and used  million in cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  million and no availability under a  million line of credit from its senior lender given the due dates of certain liability and debt payments and preferred noncontrolling interests redemption requirements management projects that we may not be able to meet all of our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months we plan to meet the projected cash flow shortage from the sale of certain assets and projected increase in revenues and decreases in expenses at our hospitals if we are unable to sell assets increase revenue or reduce expenses as described above we may be forced to obtain extensions on existing debt and other obligations as they become due over the next twelve months although we have historically been successful in obtaining extensions there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain them in the future in addition we may choose to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or assets but there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing such actions if we are not able to sell certain assets generate additional revenue or reduce expenses at our hospitals do not obtain extensions on some of our debt or other obligations during the next twelve months or if we are not able to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or assets we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in order to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months these uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern senior credit facility modification and waiver we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants imposed by its senior lenders as of june   we were not in compliance with those covenants on august   the senior lenders waived the financial covenant violations and modified the financial covenant requirements for the remainder of  and first quarter of  in addition the senior lenders extended the due date of a required  million principal payment on the revolving loan to january   there is no assurance that the senior lenders will waive any future covenant violations see liquidity and capital resources  senior credit facility for additional information hospital and asc business overview at our consolidated hospitals we serve as a majority owner daytoday manager and we have significant influence over the operations of such facilities when we have control of the facility we account for our investment in the facility as a consolidated subsidiary for our equity owned facilities our influence does not represent control of the facility but we do have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies we account for our investment in the facility under the equity method and treat the facility as a nonconsolidated affiliate for our consolidated hospitals our financial statements reflect  of the revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts the net income attributable to our physician partners who have ownership in our consolidated hospitals is included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations for our equity owned facilities our share of the net income of each equity owned facility is based on the facilitys net income and our percentage of ownership in the facility and is included in our consolidated statements as equity in earnings of affiliates we earn management fees from most of our equity owned facilities for our management of the daytoday

houston texas is expected to be syndicated with physician partners our facilities are licensed at the state level and are accredited by either the accreditation association for ambulatory healthcare aaahc or the det norske veritas dnv the only exception is our asc in nacogdoches texas which meets the accreditation standards but the governing board of this asc has elected to not seek accreditation we recognize that accreditation is a crucial quality benchmark for payors since many managed care organizations will not contract with a facility until it is accredited we believe that our historical success in obtaining and retaining accreditation for our facilities reflects our commitment to providing high quality care in our facilities generally each facility is owned and operated by either a limited partnership or limited liability company in which ownership interests are held by our local physician partners who practice at the facility and by us our partnership and limited liability company agreements typically provide for the monthly or quarterly pro rata distribution of cash equal to net profits from operations less amounts held in reserve for expenses and working capital these limited partnership or limited liability company agreements generally grant us representation on the facilitys governing board and ensure our participation in fundamental decisions our influence over the businesses of our facilities is further enhanced by our management agreements with such facilities our surgical hospitals and asc facilities depend upon thirdparty reimbursement programs to pay for our services rendered to patients including governmental medicare and managed medicare programs a broad mix of private insurance programs and copays deductibles and cash payments from patients private payors typically employ reimbursement methodologies similar to those used by government providers under medicare our facilities are reimbursed for the services rendered through the payment of facility fees which vary depending on the type of facility hospital hopd or asc and type of procedure hospitals and hopds are reimbursed for outpatient procedures in a manner similar to most ascs except that the methodologies employed to calculate reimbursement rates generally result in rates that are higher than those for comparable procedures at freestanding ascs ascs are reimbursed through the payment of a composite asc rate which is set by us based on a survey of comparative rates which includes payment for most of the expenses associated with the performance of a procedure such as nursing services supplies and staffing costs reimbursement rates for inpatient hospital services are determined using medicare severity diagnosis related groups which are intended to compensate hospitals according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for a particular diagnosed illness our surgical hospital and asc facilities depend upon thirdparty reimbursement programs including governmental and private insurance programs to pay for the preponderance of the services rendered to patients our surgical hospital and asc facilities derive a portion of their revenues from governmental healthcare programs primarily medicare and managed medicare programs and the remainder from a wide mix of commercial payors and patient copays and deductibles private payors typically follow the method in which the government reimburses healthcare providers under the governments methodology our surgical hospital and asc facilities are reimbursed for the performance of services through the payment of facility fees which vary according to whether the facility is a hospital or an asc and the type of procedure that is performed hospitals are reimbursed for outpatient procedures in a manner similar to ascs except that the methodologies employed to calculate reimbursement generally result in hospitals being reimbursed in this setting at a higher rate than freestanding ascs ascs are reimbursed through the payment of a composite asc rate which includes payment for most of the expenses associated with the performance of a procedure such as nursing services supplies and staffing costs the reimbursement rates for inpatient hospital services are determined using medicare severity diagnosis related groups which are intended to compensate hospitals
