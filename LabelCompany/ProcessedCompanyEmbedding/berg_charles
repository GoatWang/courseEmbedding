muchneeded relief from the symptoms of the new epidemic of the st century metabolic syndrome announced its products are now available for purchase on jetcom a fastgrowing online retailer bergamet na is known for being extremely selective in the ingredients it puts into its products searching all over the world for the highest quality ingredients that will lead to the best possible products as a result the bergamet line of supplements has achieved an international reputation for being the best citrus bergamot supplements available today “we are excited to announce that bergamet products are now available for purchase on jetcom” said logan decker director of operations for bergamet na “jetcom is growing extremely quickly and has become a particularly ideal platform for nutritional products and supplements we are pleased to have another opportunity to reach out to a completely new audience and introduce them to the clinically proven nutritional benefits of bergamot”bergamet na began producing its supplements in  after its founders became familiar with the benefits of the bergamot citrus fruit and especially those grown in the calabrian region of italy according to researchers and nutritionists the italian bergamot provides even stronger support for the cardiovascular system because of its comparatively larger amount of polyphenols and antioxidants these polyphenolheavy fruits are the basis of bergamet na’s supplements which it sells all over the worldover the past  years australian cardiologist dr ross walker has treated over  patients with bergamet while coauthoring numerous studies according to walker “i have only used bergametin fact i have been taking it myself for  years” it has been so gratifying to witness s of my patients getting superb results so many of my patients get side effects from drugs or prefer a more natural approach i either use bergamet alone or combine bergamet with lower dose statins depending on the clinical situation”dr walker continues “bergamet may be the most important nutritional product created in the last  years i know of no other supplement or drug that can match its value in addressing so many risk factors contributing to heart disease and diabetes”there are a few versions of bergamet available each of which has specific benefits bergamet mega  o helps people to maintain the proper levels of ldl and hdl cholesterol and triglycerides and is one of the company’s popular sellers bergafemme contains most of those same benefits for managing cholesterol but is a very effective product for pre  postmenopausal women looking to additional address menopausal symptoms“we are thrilled to be working with jetcom and to reach out to more people than ever before to help them find relief from
