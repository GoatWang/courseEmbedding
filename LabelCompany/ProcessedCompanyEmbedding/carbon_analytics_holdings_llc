renewable alternative to virgin carbon black  it is sro’s version of an environmentally friendly  recycled carbon product that performs as close to virgin carbon black in commercial rubber and plastics applications carbon black users are faced with increasing consumer and regulatory demand for “green” products and components from renewable materials  versablack™ is a”green” renewable material for environmentallypressured auto industrial and consumer manufacturers most popular related searches renewable fuel production refuse container data analysis renewable fuel domestic mold testing recycling rubber carbon black activated carbon closed pyrolysis lead in paint safety nonrecycled plastic metals in air analysis traditionally carbon black has been used as a rei traditionally carbon black has been used as a reinforcing agent in tires today because of its unique properties the uses of carbon black have expanded to include pigmentation ultraviolet uv stabilization and conductive agents in a variety of everyday and specialty high performance products including tires and industrial rubber products carbon black is added to rubber as both a filler and as a strengthening or reinforcing agent  for various types of tires it is used in inner liners carcasses sidewalls and treads utilizing different types based on specific performance requirements carbon black is also used in many molded and extruded industrial rubber products such as belts hoses gaskets diaphragms vibration isolation devices bushings air springs chassis bumpers and multiple types of pads boots wiper blades fascia conveyor wheels and grommets plastics carbon blacks are now widely used for conductive packaging films fibers moldings pipes and semiconductive cable compounds in products such as refuse sacks industrial bags photographic containers agriculture mulch film stretch wrap and thermoplastic molding applications for automotive electricalelectronics household appliances and blowmolded containers electrostatic discharge esd compounds carbon blacks are carefully designed to transform electrical characteristics from insulating to conductive in products such as electronic packaging safety applications and automotive parts high performance coatings carbon blacks provide pigmentation conductivity and uv protection for a number of coating applications including automotive primer basecoats and clear coats marine aerospace decorative wood and industrial coatings toners and printing inks carbon blacks enhance formulations and deliver broad flexibility in meeting specific color requirements   versablack™ vs virgin carbon black a look at the carbon black market first let us take a look at the leading application for carbon black is as a reinforcing agent in the production of rubber goods accounting for more than  of total carbon black consumption carbon black is largely a homogenous product with many trade names it is essentially an oil byproduct used to make tires inks and other products the principal economic industries responsible for the purchase of carbon black were domestic manufacturing industries which purchased nearly  percent of the industry’s shipments a  ranking of purchased carbon black output found these industries responsible for carbon black usage tires and inner tubes which purchased approximately  percent of the industry’s shipments industrial applications which used  percent of the carbon black manufactured in the united states and specialty applications such as wiring plastics and coatings which used  percent carbon black is essentially an oil byproduct used to strengthen rubber it is made by shooting a hot mist of oil particles into a flame a very expensive process that has limited the number of competitors in the industry carbon black is a general name for a variety of trade name products such as acetylene black attrited black channel black flame black furnace black lamp black and thermal black carbon black production requires large amounts of heat in addition to its main use in tires the powdery reinforcing agent is used to make inks and other everyday products in  us carbon black shipments were worth more than  billion and carbon black sold at prices between  and  cents per pound depending on the grade the vast majority of carbon black produced in the united states in the late s was consumed by rubber and tire manufacturing companies in  use in tires accounted for  of world consumption with other rubber goods hoses belts etc accounting for an additional  consumption for nonrubber goods plastics inks paints etc accounted for the remaining  of world consumption while specialty carbon blacks account for only  of the total market in tonnage they command a significantly higher selling price than commodity furnace black and thus will be the focus of future research and development activities the price of crude oil has an overriding influence on carbon black markets by affecting such factors as the cost of carbon black type of vehicles sold and total miles driven and even tire design eg high performance tires superabrasionresistant tread stock and the “green” tire the growth of carbon black is closely tied to the automotive industry and the production of tires with the global automobile industry moving to china india and eastern europe the tire industry has followed and with it the carbon black producers the availability of natural rubber in southeast asia is also a factor in the tire industry’s investment pattern stringent environmental laws are forcing the closure of some older carbon black capacity in developed regions so much of the future investment will be taking place in developing economies there is a continuing longterm trend toward concentration and consolidation among suppliers of carbon black petroleum companies have exited the business and it is now dominated by chemical companies for whom carbon black is a core product all major producers are global in the scope of their operations the four largest producers are cabot corporation evonik industries columbian chemicals and china synthetic rubber corp today tires and rubber products represent the major enduse applications accounting for about  of global carbon black market as stated by global industry analysts inc  developing economies in asia pacific middle eastafrica and latin america emerge as the largest and the most lucrative markets in the upcoming years increasing level of disposable personal income in these regions is expected to generate healthy demand for automobiles and other consumer applications thereby translating into higher demand asiapacific represents the largest market for carbon black in the world with a strong hold of  share developed economies such as the us and western europe are expected to display flat demand though use of specialty blacks is likely to pick up fastest in these regions consumption of carbon black in tires is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of  during  the us market for carbon black is estimated at about  million metric tons the virgin carbon black industry is likely to come under increased pressure from governments and environmental groups as this product is a significant greenhouse gas emitter demand for carbon black in paints and coatings and inks is expected to show an increase over the next five years demand for nonrubber applications that mainly use specialty blacks will display significant increase plastic and printing inks are likely to account for significant share of specialty black demand another emerging application area for specialty carbon black is metallurgy moreover as special blacks commands higher price than the widely used furnace blacks they offer higher margins to suppliers furthermore the demand for special blacks is not influenced by the cyclicality in the rubber and motor vehicle industries the report titled “carbon black a global strategic business report” published by global industry analysts inc provides a comprehensive review of market overview competitive analysis markets trends product overview product introductionsinnovations and recent industry activity the report analyzes market data and analytics in volume sales for regions such as the united states canada japan europe asiapacific excluding japan latin america and rest of world for the period  the study also analyzes the carbon black market by the following enduse segments – tires rubber products plastic inks paints  coatings and other enduses if it is not carbon black what is versablack™ sro has created a process of pyrolizing  scrap rubber from tires belts and hoses  we capture all the hydrocarbon gases and recondense them into liquids leaving behind a solid mix of carbon and steel when carbon exits the pyrolysis reactor it is in the form of fine granules which can entrap small pieces of contaminants such as steel and fiberglass fragments in order to remove the contaminants the granules must be milled to a fine powder so that these impurities can be removed from   the carbon by separation procedures the remaining fine powder then consists of only nonactivated carbon zinc oxide sulfur and small amounts of other metal oxides this enhanced product is pure enough to be used directly in rubber compounds as a rubber master batch ie carbon black zinc oxide and sulfur this rubber master batch plus other additives is combined with raw rubber and a plasticizer or soft liquid to form the rubber compound in mixing process later it is formed into sheets before final forming and molding in order for this recovered carbon to be marketable it must meet the same general technical specifications determined by the results of tests performed using procedures detailed by the american society of testing materials astm methods that are standard with suppliers and users in the carbon black market our versablack™ provides a wide array of product qualities – each unique to the application desired from resistance for weather stripping and commercial roofing to abrasion resistance for footwear and flex strength for conveyor belts and hoses versablack™ provides the essential properties for many everyday rubber applications beyond tire manufacturers over the years many materials have been used as fillers in rubber compounds in this sense filler is a diluent and is used primarily to lower volume cost with use all fillers modify certain physical properties of the compound in addition to lowering cost therefore lower cost is generally achieved at the expense of other desirable properties and all compounds are compromises with various tradeoffs considered and balanced by the compounder elastomer systems respond to the addition of a few fillers termed reinforcing agents in a way that enhances certain properties among such substances used in rubber compounding versablack™ is unique in its ability to significantly enhance the properties of nearly any base elastomer system as there is a variance for orders to use versablack™ in different areas of production sro will be able to provide our product for use for manufacturers to request specific grades that are available in the carbon black market n carcass grade black with low surface area and does not impart good abrasion resistance
