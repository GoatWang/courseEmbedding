to trade securities may be impacted by market events beyond our control such as when the markets closed following the hurricane sandy on october th  in creating our bcp we have assumed that the designated offsite locations are available that we have sufficient personnel and that external organizations such as government agencies and market systems are operational if any of these assumptions is in error our business could be disrupted until matters are resolved while no contingency plan can eliminate all risk of service interruption or temporarily impeded account access we continually
