objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results

better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search stratasys ltd the bear case from a bull d printing is going to be big business but that doesnt guarantee investing success travis hoium tmfflushdraw apr   at am theres no question d printing is a big business  and getting bigger stratasys ltd nasdaqssys and d systems corporation  have staked out the largest positions in the industry giving them a head start over competitors but its not smooth sailing ahead  stratasys hasnt yet managed to become profitable and revenue has been stagnant for three years now while im bullish on the industry and the company longterm heres where that bullish investment thesis could go wrong  image source getty images d printing doesnt grow like we expect if you look at the chart below you can see that stratasys isnt set up to make money at its current revenue level margins are improving but the company needs either more sales higher margins or lower operating costs to regain profitability  ssys revenue ttm data by ycharts margins will be tough to increase given competition unless highmargin resin sales increase disproportionately compared to equipment sales but stratasys wants more equipment sales to increase the installed base of customers that could buy resin the company also doesnt want to cut back on sales or rd staff because those are the investments that will grow sales and improve products long term  if d printing volume  both equipment and resin sales  doesnt grow over the next few years we could see financial losses persist the bearish case is that sales have stagnated and stratasys and others will be unprofitable for years to come which is certainly possible  competition takes more business than expected the d printing business is constantly changing and manufacturers need to stay on top of their game to stay competitive in the last decade thats mainly meant improving material quality and making printing easier for a wider set of consumers and more recently its meant adding d printed metals to the equation  as technology changes startups have come in and excited the market gaining customers rather quickly and theres no real brand loyalty in d printing so if someone has a better product customers are going to flock to it the most notable purchase in stratasys history was the  million acquisition of makerbot in  which didnt exactly turn the former into a profitable giant in d printing in metals printing there are other small startups that are trying to gain traction with customers creating similar competition to the plastics d printing market a few years ago where a half dozen companies are competing for the same pool of customers  whether its in plastic or metals printing competition puts pressure on prices and operating costs like sales and research and development making it tougher to turn the corner into profitability and theres not yet an indication that stratasys has such a strong position in the industry that it cant be upended by a thoughtful startup or wellfunded competitor  will d printing really start taking off  for stratasys the bull case and the bear case come down to the same metric if the company can grow revenue at a doubledigit pace over the next five years the bulls will likely be proven right if growth stalls or even goes negative bears will win out  i think the future of the d printing industry is bright and with companies like ford and airbus now integrating the rapid production of plastic and metal products into their businesses the momentum should pick up but if adoption isnt as fast or as widespread as investors think or if competition starts taking market share from stratasys the bears could win out and its worth understanding how they might be proven right
