cryptoasset egold egd into its business plan by requesting a noaction position by the securities exchange commission ftcys management has not received any response and this coupled with the difficulty in securing financial reporting conclusions associated with cryptoassets has led management to elect to rescind the previous contribution of egd and to focus upon the acquisition of gxlife globalgxlife global has developed a robust scalable platform to support multilevel marketing opportunities throughout the world this platform coupled with its complement of over  consumer products to initially be marketed through the multilevel marketing platform is intended to replace ftcys previous interest in egd ftcy is presently considering the role that cryptoassets may play in its new business plan and anticipates incorporating such a plan however the plan would likely include utilizing a registered trading cryptoasset currency other than egdning liu ceo  president of ftcy remarked while we are frustrated with the uncertainty associated with the new introduction of cryptoassets into the world economy we believe that our shift in focus from egd to our new plans provide greater certainty and nearterm financial benefits to ftcy in the meantime ftcy will continue to focus on implementing its eb immigrant investor program for foreign investors who are interested in acquiring
