adjustment or a decent rear rest the ar pictured has the common but troublesomeatthebench buttstock and appears to be levitating over the rear rest looking at the pistol grip and the mag there appears

this why not take advantage of the labour partys decision to place its fate in the hands of yearold jeremy corbyn an unreconstructed svintage marxist whom the press and the public hated look at the guy he made bernie sanders look mainstream by comparison  pm jun    by christopher caldwell christopher caldwell senior editor the weekly standard httpsamazonawscomassetsweeklystandardcomauthorscaldwellpng sorry youve reached the limit on the articles you can view gary locke british voters have just shocked europe—and perhaps themselves—by repudiating their conservative prime minister theresa may may called a snap election because it seemed an easy way to bolster her slender parliamentary majority as she began negotiating britains exit from the european union that didnt happen according to early poll projections she might lose her majority altogether mays rationale was this why not take advantage of the labour partys decision to place its fate in the hands of yearold jeremy corbyn an unreconstructed svintage marxist whom the press and the public hated look at the guy he made bernie sanders look mainstream by comparison his platform called for investing half a trillion pounds in rebuilding britains industrial infrastructure building millions of homes making universities free and renationalizing the countrys railways utilities and postal service he proposed to pay for all that by hiking corporate tax rates from  to  percent and imposing punitive taxes on real estate and incomes over  a year you could tell may was in trouble when her supporters started to browbeat the public about the laffer curve—the argument that raising tax rates can depress tax revenue yes the media was foursquare against corbyn just as mays advisers had optimistically assumed and even a majority of his own partys members of parliament opposed his leadership but neither the press nor the politicians had a clue what the public thought the public werent disliking corbyns platform as much as they were supposed to corbyn would have been a terrible candidate in a national election if this were  when he entered politics or  when he first got elected to parliament he opposed the falklands war and backed fidel castro the ira and the plo but the falklands war is over castro is dead the ira is disarmed and the plo has been superseded and a good number of the voters who showed up for corbyn were not born back in those days like sanders corbyn has found a way to thrill university students and senior citizens even while his appeal remains almost inaudible to those born between  and  youth turnout on thursday appears to have been high but with all their unleashingentrepreneurship talk it was mays people not corbyns who were dwelling in the past the centerright tories are indeed good at producing growth so was the labour party when the moderates tony blair and gordon brown ran it but neither party has shown the slightest inclination to share the wealth when the economy grows by  percent the rich take  percent it seems when it grows by  percent they take  percent this is really all that matters if the fox knows many things and the hedgehog knows one big thing corbyn is a hedgehog the big thing he knows is fighting inequality for british politics as it is in  that has proved sufficient web link
