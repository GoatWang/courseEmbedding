fixedincome securities strategy the fund normally invests approximately  of total assets in us and foreign common stocks and  in fixedincome securities at least  of total assets will be invested in senior fixedincome securities riskreward potential click on the riskreward spectrum below to view the funds in that category higher moderate lower the fund offers a way to balance the potential capital appreciation of common stocks with the income and relative stability of bonds over the long term it should be less volatile than an allstock fund since prices of stocks and bonds may respond differently to changes in economic conditions and interest rate levelsstock prices can fall because of weakness in the broad market a particular industry or specific holdings bonds may decline in response to rising interest rates a credit rating downgrade or failure of the issuer to make timely payments of interest or principal foreign investments are subject to additional risks including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas greater volatility less liquidity and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar this chart displays relative risk of each us mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart methodology we evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific riskreturn category on an annual basis a fund is generally placed in a riskreturn category based on the year standard deviation of its performance if a fund is less than  years old the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years for an asset allocation fund with less than  years of performance history substrategy returns are used when a substrategy is less than  years old the actual substrategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years risk return categories overlap a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories denoted by a plus  is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of t rowe price when a fund has a cashlike benchmark denoted by a double plus  its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns if the fund is less than  years old benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate all investments are subject to market risk including the possible loss of principal standard deviation of
