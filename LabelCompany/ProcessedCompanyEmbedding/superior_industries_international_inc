employee links contact usreceive latest news our history the beginnings like many of today’s leading auto suppliers we were founded with modest beginnings and those of us who are fortunate to work at superior today stand on the shoulders of the great men and women who built our company our founder louis l borick was a world war ii veteran that became an entrepreneur and founded superior in los angeles in   the early years of superior were focused on aftermarket  products  the first product was a bug screen that protected the front of the vehicle from road debris and insects  by  superior began offering shock absorbers further products included seat belts introduced to the race car market in  that were later modified for the consumer market superior also sold neck and shoulder cushions which attached directly around the belt in order to reduce pressure on the neck and shoulders however the company’s leading product during its early years was the “sport grip” which it introduced in  this steering wheel cover utilized superior’s patented porotherm® material that was designed to increase driving comfort while providing a more secure and safer grip on the steering wheel for the driver although initially offered in just one size and two colors the popularity of the product permitted superior to expand the offerings to a variety of colors materials sizes and styles to fit any vehicle  ultimately sport grip became the world’s leading steering wheel cover with over  million being sold   automotive wheels become the hub of our products  superior began production of chrome wheels in  with the hot rod and custom car industry making huge strides in california it was the place to be superior and lou saw an opportunity with chrome wheels first and then lou had the idea that if others could make money on “mag wheels” why not superior  it was from there that the first aftermarket aluminum wheels were produced  the first oil shock of the early ’s ushered in a need for additional light weight vehicles and from that came the idea to approach an oem   success with its aftermarket wheels ultimately led to automotive oem’s desiring to incorporate superior wheels into new automobile offerings in  ford motor company contracted with superior to begin production of the first cast aluminum wheels for the mustang ii by  superior was a staple on the mustang ii and was                                   awarded a multiyear contract    our ipo  the growth in superior’s product offerings and market acceptance as well as the need for further capital to fund growth encouraged superior to go public superior’s ipo was on november   when it offered  shares of common stock at an issuance price of  per share the company’s subsequent growth and success led to its stock being listed on the new york stock exchange in  where it continues to trade today    production capacity mirrors sales growth superior’s growth in production facilities mirrored the growth in the success of its products the company purchased its initial manufacturing facility in north hollywood california in  a second facility was opened in van nuys california in  to support production of the company’s chrome steel wheels soon to follow in  was a large facility in fayetteville arkansas superior’s first outside of california this new facility had the capacity to produce  million wheels annually  by  continued demand for the superior’s wheels and the passage of nafta led superior to open its first manufacturing facility outside of the united states in chihuahua mexico this facility provided superior with a significant and reliable capacity of  million wheels annually for its entry into new markets by  customer demands required the opening of a second facility in chihuahua this one with an annual capacity of  million wheels soon thereafter a third facility in chihuahua was opened having an annual capacity of  million wheels the company’s most recent facility again in chihuahua mexico provides superior with further capacity of  million wheels annually bringing superior’s total capacity in mexico to well over  million wheels per year      recognitions superior’s success in the market for automotive wheels did not go unnoticed the company’s reputation for performance quality and value not only allowed it to become the largest supplier of aluminum wheels in the north american market but also receive accolades from the automotive industry louis borick was personally recognized by the specialty equipment market association sema for his many achievements in    transitions from its founding in  to  superior benefited from the leadership of louis borick through his vision and energy he converted a company with those humble beginnings with great success lou was joined by his son steven borick who became a member of superior’s board of directors in  and in  was named vice president strategic planning  steven became executive vice president in  and president and chief operating officer in   in  steven was named president and chief executive officer and louis borick announced that steven was to succeed him as chairman of superior  in this position steven continued building on the strategic vision developed by his father of providing automotive wheels to the oems during steven’s tenure and consistent with his background in strategic planning and experience with the demands of oems steven developed superior as the leading supplier of aluminum wheels in the north american market  this was largely done by positioning itself as a lowcost yet highquality producer of auto wheels by expanding its manufacturing capabilities in mexico steven saw the future of the growing oem business and was instrumental in selling off the aftermarket to concentrate on the oem business  it was his drive that helped build  of the  facilities in mexico that stand as an important part of superior’s future in  steven borick retired as chairman and ceo of superior superior’s board elected don stebbins as its president and ceo effective may th of  don is a seasoned auto executive most recently serving as chairman and chief executive officer of visteon corporation a multibillion dollar publicly traded manufacturer of a wide variety of components for the automotive oem market prior to that don served as president and chief operating officer of the americas and europeasiaafrica as well as senior vice president and cfo for lear corporation  don’s efforts will be to execute on the company’s strategic plan the key components of which includes expanding superior’s global competitiveness as well as its product innovation and technology continuing to evaluate opportunities for growth and value creation applying a balanced approach to capital allocation and heightening superior’s visibility with the financial community as mr stebbins states “given the foundation of superior that i have inherited the momentum for continued progress at superior already exists harnessing the existing relationship with our customers and the capabilities and talents already in place will                              enable us

suppliers conflict minerals terms and conditions transparency careers culture job openings working conditions environmental health and safety employee links contact usreceive latest news our history the beginnings like many of today’s leading auto suppliers we were founded with modest beginnings and those of us who are fortunate to work at superior today stand on the shoulders of the great men and women who built our company our founder louis l borick was a world war ii veteran that became an entrepreneur and founded superior in los angeles in   the early years of superior were focused on aftermarket  products  the first product was a bug screen that protected the front of the vehicle from road debris and insects  by  superior began offering shock absorbers further products included seat belts introduced to the race car market in  that were later modified for the consumer market superior also sold neck and shoulder cushions which attached directly around the belt in order to reduce pressure on the neck and shoulders however the company’s leading product during its early years was the “sport grip” which it introduced in  this steering wheel cover utilized superior’s patented porotherm® material that was designed to increase driving comfort while providing a more secure and safer grip on the steering wheel for the driver although initially offered in just one size and two colors the popularity of the product permitted superior to expand the offerings to a variety of colors materials sizes and styles to fit any vehicle  ultimately sport grip became the world’s leading steering wheel cover with over  million being sold   automotive wheels become the hub of our products  superior began production of chrome wheels in  with the hot rod and custom car industry making huge strides in california it was the place to be superior and lou saw an opportunity with chrome wheels first and then lou had the idea that if others could make money on “mag wheels” why not superior  it was from there that the first aftermarket aluminum wheels were produced  the first oil shock of the early ’s ushered in a need for additional light weight vehicles and from that came the idea to approach an oem   success with its aftermarket wheels ultimately led to automotive oem’s desiring to incorporate superior wheels into new automobile offerings in  ford motor company contracted with superior to begin production of the first cast aluminum wheels for the mustang ii by  superior was a staple on the mustang ii and was                                   awarded a multiyear contract    our ipo  the growth in superior’s product offerings and market acceptance as well as the need for further capital to fund growth encouraged superior to go public superior’s ipo was on november   when it offered  shares of common stock at an issuance price of  per share the company’s subsequent growth and success led to its stock being listed on the new york stock exchange in  where it continues to trade today    production capacity mirrors sales growth superior’s growth in production facilities mirrored the growth in the success of its products the company purchased its initial manufacturing facility in north hollywood california in  a second facility was opened in van nuys california in  to support production of the company’s chrome steel wheels soon to follow in  was a large facility in fayetteville arkansas superior’s first outside of california this new facility had the capacity to produce  million wheels annually  by  continued demand for the superior’s wheels and the passage of nafta led superior to open its first manufacturing facility outside of the united states in chihuahua mexico this facility provided superior with a significant and reliable capacity of  million wheels annually for its entry into new markets by  customer demands required the opening of a second facility in chihuahua this one with an annual capacity of  million wheels soon thereafter a third facility in chihuahua was opened having an annual capacity of  million wheels the company’s most recent facility again in chihuahua mexico provides superior with further capacity of  million wheels annually bringing superior’s total capacity in mexico to well over  million wheels per year      recognitions superior’s success in the market for automotive wheels did not go unnoticed the company’s reputation for performance quality and value not only allowed it to become the largest supplier of aluminum wheels in the north american market but also receive accolades from the automotive industry louis borick was personally recognized by the specialty equipment market association sema for his many achievements in    transitions from its founding in  to  superior benefited from the leadership of louis borick through his vision and energy he converted a company with those humble beginnings with great success lou was joined by his son steven borick who became a member of superior’s board of directors in  and in  was named vice president strategic planning  steven became executive vice president in  and president and chief operating officer in   in  steven was named president and chief executive officer and louis borick announced that steven was to succeed him as chairman of superior  in this position steven continued building on the strategic vision developed by his father of providing automotive wheels to the oems during steven’s tenure and consistent with his background in strategic planning and experience with the demands of oems steven developed superior as the leading supplier of aluminum wheels in the north american market  this was largely done by positioning itself as a lowcost yet highquality producer of auto wheels by expanding its manufacturing capabilities in mexico steven saw the future of the growing oem business and was instrumental in selling off the aftermarket to concentrate on the oem business  it was his drive that helped build  of the  facilities in mexico that stand as an important part of superior’s future in  steven borick retired as chairman and ceo of superior superior’s board elected don stebbins as its president and ceo effective may th of  don is a seasoned auto executive most recently serving as chairman and chief executive officer of visteon corporation a multibillion dollar publicly traded manufacturer of a wide variety of components for the automotive oem market prior to that don served as president and chief operating officer of the americas and europeasiaafrica as well as senior vice president and cfo for lear corporation  don’s efforts will be to execute on the company’s strategic plan the key components of which includes expanding superior’s global competitiveness as well as its product innovation and technology continuing to evaluate opportunities for growth and value creation applying a balanced approach to capital allocation and heightening superior’s visibility with the financial community as mr stebbins states “given the foundation of superior that i have inherited the momentum for continued progress at superior already exists harnessing the existing relationship with our customers and the capabilities and talents already in place will                              enable us to remain the premier supplier of automotive wheels in the world”   our future with new leadership at the helm  will prove to be another significant year for the company on january   superior announced that the southfield mi location would be the new world headquarters  michigan is the global epicenter of the automotive industry  being closer to the customer offers the opportunity to expand superior’s focus on operational excellence combined with the key advantages of michigan’s rich automotive heritage there has never been a more exciting time to be part of the automotive industry and superior intends to keep the wheels of the
