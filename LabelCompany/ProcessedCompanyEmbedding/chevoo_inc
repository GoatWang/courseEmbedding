rapidly over the past two years originally chevoo was created in oregon and my role was to oversee production aspects in early  the company decided to cease operations in oregon and transition to sonoma county i advised the ceo to build a facility in healdsburg which would consolidate all facets of production and operations the facility was completed in october of  and will soon be copackaging products for other companies in need of increased production capacity is there a major accomplishment in the past year or so that you would like to share my quality assurance background led chevoo to earning our safe quality food sqf level  certification with a score of excellent the highest level certification possible this is an important milestone because it puts chevoo at the ‘gold standard’ amongst food producers in the us it is the highest standard that any retailer could expect and is maintained by businesses such as whole foods costco kroger and safeway our copacking clients could not ask for more and most importantly it means that we are doing everything in our power to produce only the safest and highest quality food for human consumption many companies will take a number of years to slowly and carefully ascend the three levels yet chevoo achieved this four months after the plant’s opening any community involvement food industry group – quality subcommittee chairwoman
