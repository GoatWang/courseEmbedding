or customer and helps in reducing identity fraud know your customer aadhaar allows service providers to view their customers addresses phone numbers and other personal details once the customer is authenticated uses of aadhaar each resident is given a unique  digit identification number known as their aadhaar number during enrollment a user is required to register  fingerprints both irises and provide their demographic information including a photograph the number is then used to authenticate the user by scanning their fingerprint or iris sending the scan to the central database for matching and once the user is authenticated various services can be provided iris creating a better and more improved aadhaar reliable iris is a protected organ unlike fingerprints does not get affected by what a person does with his or her hands hence provides better accuracy for aadhaar wider demographics iris works reliably for people across various age groups and occupation unlike

only creates negative value for brands but are also puts peoples lives in jeopardy when it comes to food and drugs even the reputation of distributors and retailers is at risk commonly used authentication mechanisms today such as holograms colorshifting inks special printing basic rfid chipped labels have shown to be ineffective in controlling counterfeiting some secure rfid ics offer robust solution and a strong protection but they are too expensive to be used at item level for high volume verayo offers highly effective technology to aid in the authentication of products and protect against counterfeiting issues by extracting silicon biometrics and creating unclonable rfid chips lowcost  unclonable customizable to product requirements multiple consumer applications with a simple tap of an nfc phone consumers can verify authenticity of the product at any time verayo has also built a robust platform to enable consumer engagement on top of authentication for a variety of applications pharmaceuticals liquor cigarettes luxury goods electronic devices cosmetics clothing access cardsand much more depending on the customers needs verayo offers two possible architectures an offline solution that checks the authenticity of a pufembedded nfc chip linked to a specific product this solution requires providing readers and tags to users and is more dedicated to supply chain stakeholders an online solution that allows any users equipped with an nfcenabled phone to check in realtime the integrity of the pufembedded nfc tag on the product this is the perfect solution for consumer market verayo currently deploys these solutions involving the production of million of chips with its partners in asia and south america in  more than  million chips were sold worldwide for more information or specific requests please contact verayo sales department x internet of things the internet of things iot is a reality some experts estimate that there will be almost seven times as many connected devices in the world as there are people by  cisco isbg april  this idea of everyday objects being embedded with sensors and chips connected to the internet having the ability to communicate and slowly taking over on easy daily tasks is gaining momentum in this smarter world staying connected is not a problem ubiquitous computing is everywhere not only smart phones and tablets but also wearables medical patches smart home appliances cloudbased security systems intelligent cars smart meters and much more over the years chips and sensors are becoming smarter smaller and cheaper and with so many applications lowcost authentication is becoming critical imagine a selfdriving car or a civil drone communicating with a hacked server or medical patches and wearables sharing data with unauthorized entities this could put peoples lives in jeopardy security is a must verayo uses stateoftheart technology to produce continuous and simple iot authentication each sensor or

latest bluetooth if the token is more than three feet away from a paired electronic device all screens and data lock automatically each token is unique and unclonable unclonable id light weight interface simple implementation unclonable devices provide strong user authentication and data signing beyond security verayo uses software and firmware layers to facilitate integration simple implementation and userfriendly interface this type of security paired with such simplicity is unlike anything else verayo provides robust authentication with no need for stored keys secure memory crypto or antitamper technology this technology is reliably used to authenticate the silicon remotely and establish trust for data being read or written to an iot endpoint verayo is working on multiple form factors and more functionality seeking new partnerships for technology integration our small hardware can be embedded in any electronic device for additional functionality and more

typical mobile use scenario  when the user and device are mobile activeiristm software library available for all phone  pc os available for arm trustzone® and intel txt hardware reference design infrared led infrared camera with an ir band pass filter integration guidelines activeiris uses advanced computer pattern recognition techniques to create mathematical representations called templates out of the unique random patterns of the iris these templates are used for recognizing the user using the following simple steps enrollment this is done once perhaps when user sets up the device to use iris recognition feature at this time the iris of both eyes is scanned to create a template the templates are securely stored on the device in its trusted environment recognition after enrollment whenever the user switches on the iris system the iris of both eyes are quickly scanned and compared with the stored templates to authenticate the user activeiris advantages delta ids activeiris

trustzone® and intel txt iris iris is the thin circular structure around the pupil in the eye it controls the size of the pupil and hence the amount of light that gets into the retina of the eye iris  a better biometric modality the iris is unique to each human being  has a different color and structure just like face voice or fingerprints the iris is also a biometric modality to uniquely identify and authenticate a human being the iris being a protected internal organ has significant advantages not affected by external environment  face and retina recognition are severely affected by lighting conditions voice recognition is affected by background noise fingerprint recognition is unreliable after washing hands does not work for people with certain kind of occupations not easily accessible  difficult to spoof  face is available in various pictures available on the internet social media sites voice can be easily recorded over phones or other chatting systems fingerprints are always available on various surfaces including the mobile devices themselves not affected by time  face eye veins finger skin voice  all change over time and hence prove to be unreliable iris  better than face eye veins voice fingerprints easy to use iris is easily visible with activeiristm a look at the mobile device is all it takes to recognize a user no need for touch slide scan wide demographics iris being a protected organ it does not get affected by age weather occupation and other external conditions secure unlike face eye veins fingerprint and other modalities iris has lower false
