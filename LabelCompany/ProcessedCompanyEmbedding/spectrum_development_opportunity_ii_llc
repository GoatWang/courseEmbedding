provides a nurturing bed for seedlings and contains a multitude of primary secondary and trace nutrients necessary for a plant’s optimum health however a plant’s genetic performance is limited by the least available nutrient and its ability to uptake nutrients at the right time highly productive soils feature a healthy microbial community and result in increased nutritional quality increased genetic performance and increased yields more plant growth and development depends upon maximizing the effects of photosynthesis enrich plant health by planting seeds in productive soils getting the stand off to a good start provide the right nutrients when the plant can use it most and identify potential stresses and ways to minimize those stresses before they hit  a healthy plant features broad leaves and full kernelspods more energy drives the entire crop production system through chemical physical and biological processes  the plant’s ability to harness the sun’s energy to produce highquality yields and transfer that energy to the kernel results in increased yields improved feed quality and ultimately increases your return on investment more while achieving improvements to your bottom line and increasing yield are often the key measures for success in farming we challenge you to think beyond traditional yields do you see early crop differentials compared to your neighbors
