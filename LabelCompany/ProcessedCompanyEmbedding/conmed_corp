french roadutica new york ref denwldear mr corasanti during an inspection of your firm conmed electrosurgery located at  e fremont avenue centennial coon august  through september   investigators from the united states food and drug administration fda determined that your firm manufactures medical devices used for open and laparoscopic surgical procedures including the altrus tissue fusion system hyfrecator  and bicap hemostasis probe  under section h of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § h these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the body the inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section h of the act  usc § h in that the methods used in or the facilities or controls used for their manufacture packing storage or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation found at title  code of federal regulations cfr part   we received responses from mr dave murray executive vice president and general manager dated october  and november   concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the form fda  fda  list of inspectional observations which was issued to your firm we address these responses below in relation to each of the noted violations these violations include but are not limited to the following     procedures for design change have not been adequately established per  cfr i your design verification  validation procedures sop  rev    require an evaluation of the impact of changes to a released design on the device function and performance however your firm failed to fully and adequately evaluate design changes to altrus tissue fusion system mm and mm handpieces to ensure that verification andor validation activities were complete for example a    your firm failed to adequately evaluate the potential effect of b specifically a design change was made to the b b however b tests were deemed unnecessary based on a previous engineering study the engineering study was found to have numerous deficiencies including i        no documentation of how the b were obtainedii        no documented rationale for measuring b when at the time the handpiece was designed for up to  activationsiii        b modes respectively your firm failed to reevaluate the engineering study when at a later date you defined a b additionally there was no documented justification for the b specificationiv        no studies were conducted on the mm handpieces even though the design of the b differs from the mm handpiece bv        the study was conducted using b only no actual production parts were studied b    your firm failed to adequately evaluate a revision to the altrus tissue fusion system controller software which b specifically after your impact analysis determined that the software change would b tests these protocols were repeated however numerous deficiencies were observed with the design verification protocols including i        no documentation of any b tests to evaluate b on the mm handpiecesii        b handpieces mm tested for b failed the b acceptance criteria b test points combined total yet the b were not investigated and the design verification report results were marked as “pass”iii        the design verification reports mm handpiece b and b report show that the design verification tests were conducted with b not the biv        the design verification protocol approved on  and executed on  shows that multiple tests were “not executed per b however that document b was not approved until  approximately two months after the executed protocol furthermore impact analysis b does not include any justification for omitting certain tests bv        design verification report b shows that your firm used data from a previous design verification study b which showed failing results for b handpieces tested for b and which stated bhowever there was no documentation that the failing test results were addressed c    design verification for a software change b was incomplete design control deficiencies included                                      i    no documentation of any b tests to evaluate bii    the impact analysis record for the mm handpieces b identified b of the mm handpiece that were affected by the b however test data showed that the b test for b only tested the b not the specified b the results were marked as “passed”iii        b handpieces b tested for b failed the b verification acceptance criteria b test points combined total yet the b were not investigated and the design verification report results were marked as “pass” on the design verification reportiv    the design verification report b summarizes results from the executed altrus handpiece design verification protocol b which indicated that both mm and mm handpieces were to be evaluated for b however there was no documentation that mm handpieces were subjected to these testsv    portions of the installation qualification for the b applicable to the configuration file were b in the mm handpiece b however the associated performance qualification was not reexecuted b we have reviewed your october   response and do not consider it to be adequate some specific examples include the following but these should only be considered as examples and not an allinclusive list of our concerns with your response to this observation  the justification for the b specification of b was not available during the inspection and was not sent with your initial response when it was subsequently provided it was dated  well after the b specification was set  furthermore during the verification studies for the b the b studies were completed with unapproved verification test methodology following which your firm concluded that the design change had no impact on b we must question the conclusion when an unapproved test method was used to obtain important data  your october  response indicated that verification studies had been conducted on the mm handpiece for the design change to the b and referenced report b this report was not provided to the investigators during the inspection and was not provided as part of your response  your response acknowledges that b verification was conducted using the b rather than b for the b we are not clear why your firm would intentionally choose to use an b for a portion of verification activities rather than clearly verifying the entire change with the b our main concern is that your response included a number of reports studies etc which you are using to justify the design changes that were not conducted until well after the design changes were implemented and devices were released for distribution and after your firm received the fda we have serious concerns regarding your design controls system due to the number and extent of issues observed regarding the altrus thermal tissue fusion system we acknowledge that you have revised b procedures in this area and have stated that a review of design history files for all products will be conducted and further that you will have “independent corporate auditors” assess the quality system at the centennial facility we will review revised procedures and your adherence to the new procedures during a future inspection as we also reevaluate your design controls and quality systems however with the number of verification reports impact analyses test protocols etc that were completed for the handpieces only after the inspection we are concerned with the appearance of justifying changes after the fact we recommend a thorough examination of your design controls system and documentation practices to assure that all required documentation is in place that reports do not reference other reports which postdate the first report that approved test methodologies are used etc should your corrective action plan change or expand following the audit of the facility please provide details of the changes with your response as stated previously the specific examples above should not be considered an allinclusive list of our concerns regarding your response to this observation please also see the “k” section for additional concerns     procedures for corrective and preventive actions have not been adequately established as required by  cfr a specifically since release of the altrus tissue fusion system your firm has received  complaints regarding burns potential burns or handpieces that were “too hot” b of these complaints resulted in patient injury either internal or external burns a corrective and preventive action capa was not initiated in spite of  patient burn injuries  complaint trending codes including “overheating of components” and “overheat” and  the total number of complaints regarding the temperature of the device we have reviewed your october  response and do not consider it to be adequate your retrospective review of complaints to determine if a corrective and preventive action was needed appears to have focused solely on complaints involving patient injury corrective and preventive actions may need to be initiated for reasons other than patient injury additionally your response indicates that you will be issuing a safety update to your customers regarding the device temperature however labeling is typically considered the last resort of risk mitigation we also note that your response did not address the study initiated in march  to b engineering memo b which appears to indicate your firm was aware of an issue with the altrus handpieces and attempted to address it outside of the corrective and preventive action system the design change in the study has not been implemented     procedures to control environmental conditions have not been adequately established as required by  cfr c your procedure sop facility practices procedure rev   fails to address product disposition when alert andor action levels are exceeded sop wi rev   airborne and surface contamination monitoring procedure also fails to address product disposition when alert andor action levels are exceeded  specifically on march   controlled environment air particulate counts exceeded action levels in b areas tested b lots of altrus handpieces b and b lots of bicap hemostasis probes b were being manufactured in the area at the time of the excursion no evaluation of nonviable particulates was performed on any of the impacted lots all b lots were released for distribution based solely on bioburden testing of a portion of each lot in addition on march   particulate action levels were again exceeded in b areas tested b lots of altrus handpieces were impacted by the excursion b these lots were not evaluated for nonviable particulates and were released for distribution based upon bioburden testing of the lots impacted approximately three weeks prior this procedure of accepting possible nonconforming product based upon prior testing is not documented in any procedure we have reviewed your october   response and do not consider it to be adequate the health hazard evaluation hhe you referenced in concluding the risk to patients was negligible when bioburden testing was not conducted following the march   excursion was not written until october  approximately seven months after the affected lots were released to distribution  we also believe your revised procedures may not yet be sufficient to control environmental conditions and assure proper action regarding finished products  additionally regarding nonviable particulate contamination and the potential risk to patients you have not provided any evidence to demonstrate that you have evaluated the types of particulates that may be introduced onto the devices the characterization of such particles eg size shape and composition at what point during manufacture they may be introduced nor have you validated the cleaning procedures for the altrus handpieces or bicap hemostasis probes prior to packaging to demonstrate that particulates are effectively removed we also note that you do not have any established design requirements for particulates on either the altrus handpieces or bicap hemostasis probes we acknowledge that you have initiated a voluntary recall of altrus handpiece lot s chb chb     risk analysis is incomplete per  cfr g for example a    the risk management plan for the altrus system rev   requires review of complaint data to determine if the risk analyses remain complete and adequate since release of the altrus system mm and mm handpieces on  and  respectively your firm has received eight complaints of external burns to patients however the altrus thermal tissue fusion system level hazard analysis rev m  fails to address and evaluate the risk of external burns to patients b    the packaging procedure for altrus tissue fusion handpieces b established limits for particulates on packaged finished product as “does not contain embedded particles stains scratches or chips in excess of b embedded particles stains scratches or chips larger than b are unacceptable” however the altrus thermal tissue fusion system level hazard analysis rev m  fails to address the risk to patients due to particulate contamination in the finished devices on  b nonconformance reports ncrs were initiated for b lots of altrus handpieces that were exposed to environmental particulate counts which exceeded action levels during manufacture b lots were released for distribution c    the bicap probe hazard analysis document b  and the bicap probe process failure modes effects analysis fmea document b  fail to address the risk to patients due to particulate contamination in the finished product on  b nonconformance reports ncrs were initiated for b lots of bicap probe units b units total that were exposed to particulate counts which exceeded action levels during manufacture b lots were released for distribution     we have reviewed your october   response but do not consider it to be adequate  regarding the risk of burns to patients your response references the altrus tissue fusion system instructions for use ifu however labeling is typically considered the last resort of risk mitigation regarding your response to the issue of particulate contamination and the potential risk to patients you have not provided any evidence to demonstrate that you have evaluated the types of particulates that may be introduced onto the device the characterization of such particles eg size shape and composition at what point during manufacture they may be introduced nor have you validated the cleaning procedures for the altrus handpieces or bicap hemostasis probes prior to packaging without any knowledge of the type of particles introduced into the environment when the action level of b was exceeded we cannot agree that the b lots of altrus handpieces and b lots of bicap hemostasis probes posed no risk to patients when released for distribution we acknowledge that you have made changes to your risk analysis procedures and that you are preforming a retrospective review of b additional product lines these actions will be reviewed onsite during a future inspection                procedures for receiving reviewing and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit have not been adequately established as required by  cfr a specifically your procedure complaint handling sop rev  does not assure that complaint investigations are complete and consistently documented for example a    the procedure complaint handling sop rev  does not require a review of device history records dhr for disposable items unless the event is reportable under the medical device reporting regulations even when the device is returned or the lot number is known specifically b of  complaints received for altrus handpieces between  and  showed that lot numbers were provided but dhrs were not reviewed prior to the complaints being closed b    information recorded on complaint records b was inaccurate in that the complaint records concluded no corrective action was necessary when in fact a corrective and preventive action capa had been initiated for the issue of detached heaters the corrective and preventive action document was not referenced in the complaint records we have reviewed your responses but do not consider them to be adequate we acknowledge that you provided a revised complaint procedure for your utica ny headquarters sop rev e   one of the flow diagrams attached to sop appears to indicate various investigative responsibilities for “ts denver” including investigation of complaints and completion of a “child investigation” form please clarify whether the centennial co procedure sop has been rendered obsolete or whether there are any newrevised complaint procedures covering responsibilities of the centennial facility during complaint investigations regarding the “parent” and “child” forms completed by utica ny and centennial co respectively we noted that these often contained conflicting information in terms of whether or not there was a patient injury involved  we note that you conducted a retrospective complaint review limited to altrus handpieces for complaints where the device was not returned but the lot number was available b according to your response the device history records for these devices were reviewed with the majority marked as “closed” on your summary report please clarify whether these complaints were evaluated for identification of possible trends whether any root causes were identified during the review and also whether any necessary corrective actions were identified please also clarify whether you will be expanding the retrospective complaint review to other devices     certain inspection and measuring equipment is not suitable for its intended purpose and capable of producing valid results as required by  cfr a specifically your firm utilizes b to calibrate mm and mm altrus handpieces your firm has not demonstrated that this equipment is capable of producing valid results due to the following a    no records were available to demonstrate that your method of determining emissivity for the mm and mm altrus handpieces had been validated b    your firm failed to consider the effect of reflected energy from the opposing heater on the handpiece in terms of how it would affect b during calibration of the altrus handpieces  c    your firm did not calculate emissivity values in accordance with the b manufacturer’s recommendation in that all b recommendations from the manufacturer include use of the b however your firm only used the b indirectly and instead relied b during studies furthermore the b user manual indicates the b yet your emissivity studies were conducted while the handpieces were b we have reviewed your october  response and do not consider it to be adequate specifically your response did not address our concern regarding how the emissivity of b was calculated and whether that method of determining the emissivity was validated your response indicated that since the inspection you have determined that the altrus handpiece b are calibrated b however this is not clear from b test procedure nor is it what the investigator was told during the inspection if you have additional documentation to demonstrate that the b are operated b please provide that information your response also appears to indicate that reflected energy from the opposing handpiece is reduced or eliminated because the opposing heater is “not a source of energy that can be reflected by the heater undergoing calibration” this statement implies that the opposing heater is actually not activated as the opposing heater is being calibrated if you have documentation to demonstrate that the opposing heater can be inactivated while the opposing heater is activated for calibration please provide that information regarding the calculation of emissivity values not in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations based upon the stepbystep progression for determining emissivity values presented in your response it still appears that the b are being used indirectly this indirect use of the b was also acknowledged by a conmed employee during the inspection please indicate whether you consulted with the manufacturer b regarding your inhouse method for calculating emissivity prior to implementing it for use and if so what input you received please also submit a copy of your procedure mptemp with your response     a process whose results cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test has not been adequately validated according to established procedures per  cfr a specifically your procedure manufacturing qualification process sop requires the validation of processes for which the output cannot be verified procedures for the bicap hemostasis probe include a b packaging procedures for the altrus handpiece include b neither of these cleaning processes has been validated to demonstrate that they reduce the number of viable and nonviable particulates on the finished products  we have reviewed your october   response but do not consider it to be adequate during the inspection your firm did not appear to have design requirements for particulate viable and nonviable for either the bicap hemostasis probe or the altrus handpiece both of which are sterile devices furthermore an employee stated that your firm did not have a testing method for particulates although the packaging procedures for the altrus reference the b standard for particulates this examination is not recorded please clarify if your design requirements for these and other sterile devices have specific requirements referenced for particulate viable and nonviable and whether you have identified and characterized the nonviable particulates please also clarify whether you have demonstrated that the cleaning procedures above reduce the number of particulates and also whether employees responsible for visually inspecting packaged product have been challenged to demonstrate they can consistently identify particulate of specified size and number in a b examination per the packaging procedure for the altrus handpiece     procedures have not been adequately established to control product that does not conform to specified requirements per  cfr a specifically a    your firm failed to initiate a nonconformance report ncr after the action level for particulates b was exceeded during the manufacture of altrus handpieces b on  an ncr is required by your facility practices procedure sop although no ncr was initiated the b lots were released for distribution with no documentation that b lot was evaluated for the impact of either viable or nonviable particulates instead your firm relied upon bioburden testing from altrus handpiece lots manufactured three weeks prior to conclude that lots b would not be adversely impacted by the particulate excursion during manufacture b    your nonconforming procedure sop rev  states that any documents supporting the evaluation investigation andor disposition decision of ncrs should be referenced and attached to the corresponding b document review of your ncrs revealed i    b ncrs were dispositioned without documentation of any investigations or any justification for lack of an investigationii    b ncrs regarding problems with product pouch seals attributed to the b pouch sealing machine failed to include any reference or link to the corrective and preventive action document b which was opened to address the issue furthermore your quality engineer supervisor informed our investigators that investigations are not routinely performed for nonconformance reports unless a trend is noted however your procedure does not reference this practice nor does the procedure identify how a trend is identifieddefined we have reviewed your october   response and it appears to be adequate however as all attachments were not provided with the revised ncr forms submitted we cannot evaluate whether the disposition of the products or any investigation was appropriate additionally we will review any future ncrs during a subsequent inspection to determine if you are following your procedures and if nonconformances are being appropriately investigated and dispositioned     acceptance activities were not documented and maintained as part of the device history record as required by  cfr e for example a    b altrus handpieces b did not meet acceptance criteria in that b handpiece did not include any results for the temperature verification test and b exceeded the temperature verification maximum of b the product acceptance and production order records review sop requires that device history records be reviewed for completeness and that product is held until any discrepancies are resolved however the b handpieces were released for distribution with no indication that that discrepancies were noted or resolved b    b device history records reviewed for altrus b failed to include documentation of all required inprocess acceptance activities we have reviewed your october   response and although it appears to be adequate during a future inspection we will review the validation of the electronic system that you are currently developing for the collection and review of verification data additionally your response indicates that you are revising approximately  device manufacturing procedures to clarify certain inprocess requirements we will review the changes during a future inspection to fully assess the adequacy of your corrective action k our inspection has
