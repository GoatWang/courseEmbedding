ouster at aol but where does trail end by david d kirkpatricksept   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story before he came to america online in  david m colburn was a corporate lawyer in palo alto calif known for his meticulousness his aggression and his eccentricity commuting from los angeles he shaved once a week drove a beatup clunker and slept in a cheap motel in an office of suits and khakis he customarily wore cowboy boots with pinstripe suit pants polo shirts and an earring he became notorious for screaming and swearing at younger lawyers for offenses like the failure to underline the phrase provided however while preparing a contract lawyers who worked with him saidthe same noholdsbarred approach to business helped propel mr colburns rise at aol where he became the chief deal maker in charge of its business affairs department it may also have led to his disgrace three weeks ago he was ousted after federal investigators and an internal inquiry by lawyers for aol time warner began looking into the possibility that deals he negotiated may have inappropriately inflated the companys revenuenow his departure has raised the question of whether investigators will stop at mr colburn or turn their attention to the executives around and above him it is as yet unclear whether mr colburn concealed financial details from others at america online but people who worked with him said he was always more of a builder than an architect better at details and execution than devising strategy on his own and at aol he collaborated closely with other executives including those in charge of the companys finances and programming they said all signed off on the structure of all his major dealsmr colburn was recruited to aol by miles r gilburne a mentor for most of mr colburns career in the legal world mr gilburne became aols chief corporate strategist and mr colburn helped him hammer out the details of some of aols biggest deals robert w pittman the former president of aol who became chief operating officer of aol time warner promoted mr colburn to head aols business affairs department and supervised his work j michael kelly signed off on the accounting for all mr colburns major transactions as the chief financial officer of aol before it acquired time warner and of the combined company afterward advertisement continue reading the main story each of these executives declined to comment last week on their rolessome of mr colburns colleagues at aol  and even some who have negotiated against him  said they felt he had been unfairly singled out in part because of his sometimes abrasive style continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story people turned on him said dan borislow former chief executive of telsave who had sat opposite mr colburn in several negotiations every single transaction that he did was approved by somebody in finance david is an excellent competent person who covers himself very well and he is a jerk that is why he is in trouble if the guy was a nice guy he wouldnt be in the newsmr colburns friends including some current aol executives say he was neither trained as an accountant nor responsible for the companys financial reports putting him a step removed from potential accounting misdeedsdavid colburn would not pass an introductory accounting exam said allan b koltin an old friend who is now a consultant to accounting and law firms he wasnt high enough in the executive ranks to approve the accounting for transactions of any magnitude what really smells about what aol is doing is they are trying to say we had one or two bad seeds among us and we have washed our hands of them and now we are clean and pure again on aug  aol time warners top executives asked mr colburn to stop coming to work and fired him the next day company executives said he was asked to leave partly because a tip from an employee had turned up three questionable transactions  one with worldcom and two with stillundisclosed companies  bearing mr colburns fingerprints the company said the deals might have overstated its revenue by  million over the  months ending last march lawyers for aol time warner have sealed mr colburns office to search it for evidence company executives saidthe questionable  million that aol time warner has identified is less than  percent of the aol divisions annual revenue and in contrast to companies like enron or worldcom at aol there is no clear evidence of wrongdoing but aol time warner is conducting an internal investigation into accounting at its aol division over the last two years alongside those by the securities and exchange commission and the justice departmentinvestors are anxious about the investigations in part because aol has pushed the limits of accounting rules before in  the company settled an unrelated sec inquiry by paying a fine and pledging not to violate any securities laws in the future securities law experts say such settlements often lead both the sec and the justice department to take a tougher stance the next time a problem occursone question at issue people involved with both the sec and internal inquiries have said is whether aol might have overstated its results by trading goods or services with other companies at inflated prices and recording the prices as revenue the practice is known as roundtripping because money paid out as an expense effectively comes back recorded as sales and artificially bolstering the top line it is an especially thorny issue for aol because the company prided itself on doing reciprocal business  for example selling advertising to many of its telecommunications and technology suppliers advertisement continue reading the main story mr colburn the point man in charge of negotiating advertising sales agreements for aol played a crucial role in most of aols reciprocal deals including its transactions with worldcom but people who worked with him in the past say his maverick persona did not necessarily extend to his approach to his workhere was a really conservative lawyer who knew the law and counseled clients not to take legal risks said lior nuchi a lawyer who worked with mr colburn in the palo alto office of weil gotshal  manges before  the other thing i learned about david is he always made himself a strong no  i never saw him as a guy who wanted to be the primary decision makermr colburn spent most of his career as a no  to mr gilburne who was a close adviser to aols chairman stephen m case after graduating from the university of wisconsin law school mr colburn began working for mr gilburn at a los angeles law firm when mr gilburne left to start a venture capital firm mr colburn did his legal work then mr colburn followed mr gilburne when he opened a palo alto office for weil gotshal and again when he joined aolby then mr colburn had practiced law for about  years as an associate nearly twice as long as it often takes to become a partner when mr gilburne left for aol mr colburn finally had a strong chance to make partner but he gave it up to follow his mentor mr nuchi saidat aol mr colburn and mr gilburne made an oddly complementary pair several people who worked with them said mr gilburne is a broad strategic thinker with a quiet professorial demeanor he is prone to stroking his beard alluding to shakespeare and making delphic comments about the technological future mr colburn on the other hand is as volatile as mr gilburne is sedate people who worked with them said mr colburn paced conference rooms with bleary eyes and a five oclock shadow he was known for wearing armani suits over black tshirts depicting cartoon characters and mr colburn was also as intensely focused on details as his mentor was on the big picturemr gilburne sometimes joked that his favorite deals were the hardest ones to understand people who worked with him said and he worked closely with mr colburn to iron out the structure of aols biggest and most esoteric transactions in november  for example the two executives shuttled back and forth between the silicon valley headquarters of netscape communications and sun microsystems playing their contemplative goodcop aggressive badcop roles as they worked out a complicated threeway deal for the sale of one company and a partnership with the other the deal also involved some of the issues now drawing attention from securities regulators newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email

or contact us anytime in one part of the deal sun agreed to pay aol more than  million a year as part of a threeyear partnership called iplanet aol treated the payments as recurring revenue until last january when aol time warner announced that the partnership would not continue in a simultaneous deal aol agreed to buy  million in computer equipment from sun at list price even though companies like aol usually buy at a discount of more than  percent in turn sun agreed to pay aol  million in licensing marketing and advertising fees raising the possibility that aol was effectively getting back some of its expenditures to bolster its own revenuean aol time warner spokesman declined to comment on specific deals but said the company accounted for the sun transaction appropriately a spokeswoman for sun said it accounted for the deals appropriatelyalthough mr gilburne recruited mr colburn to aol mr pittman beefed up the companys business affairs division and tapped mr colburn to run it when mr pittman joined america online in  as president of its america online networks division he quickly set about streamlining its freewheeling management he introduced a new focus on bottomline results and increased each executives accountability several aol executives said he also instilled a rigorous reporting structure imposing order on fractious fiefs within aol and he prided himself on his ability to exhort his employees to greater accomplishments those who disappointed him were replaced advertisement continue reading the main story but mr pittman lavishly rewarded executives who did meet their quarterly goals mr colburn earned enough from aol stock options to hire n sync and the dave matthews band to perform for the birthday parties of two of his childrenat the time aol was shifting its business model to selling advertising as well as subscriptions and mr pittman expanded the business affairs division partly to coordinate the efforts of the companys advertising sales force and the executives who controlled the content on various parts of its service analysts and company executives credit mr pittman and mr colburn with orchestrating much of aols remarkable success at increasing its advertising revenue during the boom years from  through  partly through mr colburns bareknuckled negotiatingmr pittman also championed the idea that it was simply good business for aol to take equity in its advertisers and sell ads to its suppliers twoway transactions that became a specialty of mr colburns business affairs divisionin  mr pittman introduced mr colburn to mr borislow the former chief executive of telsave which is now called talkcom mr pittman had agreed in principle to sell advertising to telsave in exchange for a combination of cash and warrants to buy its stock aols first deal of the kind then turned the negotiations over to mr colburn to work out mr colburn managed to wring an upfront payment of  million from mr borislow making him a hero within aol and mr pittman trumpeted the victorythe sec later challenged how aol accounted for its equity in telsave forcing aol to restate its earnings for the last quarter of  downward by  million harvey l pitt then in private practice and now sec chairman represented aol in settling the matterafter aol acquired time warner mr pittman again promoted mr colburn to head of business affairs for the combined company executives at the parent company have said that mr pittman personally worked hard supporting mr colburn to push through its major companywide advertising deals including an agreement to sell advertising from both the aol division and the time warner businesses to worldcom in another reciprocal transaction aol simultaneously agreed to continue buying telecommunications services from worldcom and aol time warner executives have said that a twoway transaction with worldcom contributed to the questionable  million the company discoveredaol time warner executives and mr pittmans friends said however that he was seldom personally involved in the details of accounting one aol time warner executive said the questionable transaction with worldcom amounted to less than half the  million possibly representing some side deal such relatively insignificant sums would be well below mr pittmans review executives saidmr kelly the chief financial officer of aol and then aol time warner was the executive most directly responsible for the accuracy of the companys accounting he joined aol in june  the son of an fbi agent he like mr colburn could sometimes be hottempered aol time warner executives said advertisement continue reading the main story aol time warner executives said that it was mr colburns job to try to do everything possible to post strong results and it was mr kellys job to stop him at the limits of accounting rules mr kelly signed off on all of its major deals and its financial reports until december  when he was demoted to chief operating officer of the aol division after a burst of anger at a wall street analystbut aol time warner executives noted that mr kelly was no longer chief financial officer for five of the six quarters during which the company has discovered questionable revenue executives said mr kelley had instituted a new stricter program of financial controls at aol they added that the internal policing mr kelly initiated helped block a number of creative transactions involving advertising sales aol time warner executives and friends of mr kelly said he often clashed with mr colburn over business matters mr pittman was then called in to resolve their disputesmr kellys friends add that a chief financial officer is only as good as the information he is givenlast week with no clear evidence of significant wrongdoing at aol lawyers said it was still too soon to assess the wisdom of aol time warners decision to remove mr colburn martin r pollner a defense lawyer who handles whitecollar crime cases said the firing of mr colburn demonstrates that aol time warner is cleaning house but it may also encourage mr colburn to cooperate with federal investigators looking at aolit sends a signal to the government that this is someone to talk to and the game of lets make a deal begins mr pollner said continue reading the main story weâre interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats next loading go

software have crossplatform capabilities  the aol interactive service currently has in excess of  million subscribers worldwide the compuserve interactive service offered by aols compuserve subsidiary currently has approximately  million subscribers worldwide aol members each day generate over  billion web hits and send  million emails  aol distributes a browser to its members as part of its client software browsers are software applications that facilitate the viewing of information on the internet aol adds or integrates browsers into its client software to provide its members with the ability easily to move back and forth between the features of aols online service and the internet browsers and desktops  from aols perspective a browser is a software application that is different from and not a part of the underlying operating system browsers are layered on top of operating systems and have the ability to act as a platform from which software applications and other programs on the internet can be launched or driven browsers thus provide some of the platform characteristics of an operating system since they can manage the calls to an operating system although they are not themselves operating systems from an application programmers perspective browsers can be a platform for which programs can be written and can provide support across different operating systems  a desktop refers to the first persistent screen typically seen by a computer user when turning on his or her computer and to the software which supports the display and operation of the icons that appear on that screen by placement of icons on the desktop the desktop provider can direct or influence the navigation of a user to preferred functions and features of the operating system or to particular application programs or internet destinations aols consideration of licensing a third party browser  beginning in the  time frame the internet became an increasingly important element of the interactive marketplace to enhance its members ability to use the internet aol needed to provide its members with a browser in  aol purchased a browser company named booklink and in early  began to distribute the booklink browser to its subscribers as part of aols client software  by mid there were browsers other than booklink in the marketplace netscape in particular had developed a popular browser known as navigator netscapes browser was an innovative and widelyused product that had been well received in the marketplace as a result by mid netscape had a significant number of users and a strong competitive presence and reputation at that same time it was well known that microsoft was developing a browser ultimately known as internet explorer for use with its windows  operating system released in august of that year microsofts browser however did not in mid have the same extensive usage or marketplace position that netscape enjoyed  prior to my arrival at the company in september  aol had been assessing whether to continue to rely exclusively on its booklink browser or to seek to license a third party browser by the time i joined the company aol had concluded that it would require a significant expenditure of resources to improve and upgrade the booklink browser to remain competitive with the netscape browser and with what aol believed was likely in the future to be a competitive microsoft browser aol concluded that given the difficult and expensive process that would be required to improve and upgrade booklink it was worth exploring the possibility of obtaining a license to distribute an existing third party browser with aols client software the competitive environment  in  microsoft was as it is now the leading supplier of personal computer operating systems in august of that year it launched windows  which became one of the fastest selling software products in history  in connection with its introduction of windows  microsoft became a direct competitor of aol by launching its own online service known as the microsoft network msn microsoft included msn code in its windows  operating system and placed an msn icon on the windows  desktop  because microsoft was the largest operating system provider microsoft had a potentially decisive strategic advantage in competing against other online service providers such as aol through its ability to bundle msn with the windows operating system and to place an msn icon in a prominent position on the desktop by august  microsoft had already begun to include msn in every copy of windows  that it shipped both to personal computer manufacturers socalled oems and in retail copies by doing so microsoft was able to ensure that every consumer who purchased either a new computer or a windows  product at retail had msn easily available to subscribe to the microsoft online service a consumer would merely have to click on the msn icon that appeared on the desktop when he or she turned on the computer  because a large majority of the personal computers sold in this country include the windows operating system microsoft was thus to achieve virtually costless distribution of msn to almost every new computer user  by contrast to msns virtually costfree distribution aol was forced to rely on other more expensive methods of distributing its software those methods included the mailing out of disks or cds to individual potential subscribers as well as the distribution of disks and cds at public events such as sporting events and concerts in addition to being more costly than the method used by microsoft to distribute msn those methods required more effort by the consumer to access aol than was required to access msn in particular a consumer who wanted to access the aol service would have to take the time to actually load the disc or cd into his or her computer install and configure the aol client software and then access the aol service  aol recognized that having its software already loaded on a computer when it was purchased by a consumer would be a uniquely effective method of distribution and that placement of its icon on the desktop would be a uniquely effective method of promotion and installation it also recognized that microsofts ability to bundle msn with its operating system and place an msn icon on the desktop ensured that msn would be immediately available on almost every computer purchased by a consumer while aol sought to obtain a similar form of distribution by entering into agreements with individual oems to have its software preinstalled on their personal computers aol was required to pay acquisition fees or bounties to the oems for each new subscriber that aol obtained in that manner microsoft by contrast did not incur such fees when it bundled msn with its windows operating systems and no single computer manufacturer had the same ubiquitous market position as that held by the microsoft operating system  because of microsofts distribution advantages aol became very concerned that the bundling of msn into the windows operating system and the inclusion of an msn icon on the desktop would put aol at a severe and unfair competitive disadvantage to msn  moreover the bundling of msn with windows  and the inclusion of an msn icon on the desktop created a sense in the marketplace that msns commercial success was inevitable whatever the merits of that service aol thus complained publicly and to the department of justice in the summer of  about what it felt was microsofts ability to use its market position in operating systems to gain an unfair advantage in the online services business  netscape on the other hand had in  the leading market position in the browser market at the time netscape was focusing on selling software to end users corporations and through partnerships with online and internet service providers it was not at that time a direct competitor to aol and that factor coupled with the brand name market position and features of the netscape browser made it the obvious choice for aol licensing indeed netscape told aol that it had no intention of entering the online services business but rather planned to license software to other entities who wanted to enter that business those representations were important to aol since aol believed that it was possible that the netscape browser could eventually become a platform comparable in certain respects to an operating system were this to occur and were the netscape browser to become as ubiquitous as the microsoft operating system aol was concerned that such a market position could be misused to favor affiliated applications and could create the same kinds of unfair competitive advantages that aol was facing with respect to msn these concerns formed the context for the negotiations described below with netscape and microsoft in the latter part of  and early  aols negotiations with netscape  aol entered into active negotiations with netscape in approximately october  these negotiations resulted in the netscape agreement signed on march   which created a browser licensing arrangement a significant aspect of which was the promise by netscape to develop at aols request and cost a componentized browser that aol could integrate into its client software aol aol aols negotiations with microsoft  sometime in late  microsoft indicated its interest in licensing to aol its browser internet explorer i understood that microsoft was aware that aol was then negotiating with netscape for a license of the netscape browser aolm aolm aolm  at some point in aols discussion with microsoft microsoft indicated that it might be willing to consider including aol in some form in the windows operating system aolm after substantial discussions microsoft offered to put an online services folder icon on the desktop and to include an aol icon and the code needed to install aols client software in that folder this offered aol an opportunity to achieve a form of distribution and promotion in windows  and on its desktop that while not comparable to that accorded to msn was nonetheless of immense value to aol the willingness of microsoft to bundle aol in some form with the windows operating system was a critically important competitive factor that was impossible for netscape to match  aol would not have been willing to negotiate a browser license with microsoft had microsoft not indicated a willingness to bundle and to promote the aol client software in some form with windows distribution and promotion on the windows desktop was one of aols goals  indeed the most significant one  in negotiating a browser agreement with microsoft the value of distribution through and promotion on the windows desktop was something that netscape could not provide  as the negotiations with microsoft and netscape progressed there were four other less significant considerations in aols mind in deciding how to proceed first aol wanted a browser with the necessary functionality to meet its members needs and to improve its members experience over that offered by booklink second aol wanted the flexibility of being able to integrate different browsers into its client software thus providing its users a choice of browsers aol aol aol aol aolm aol third aol wanted the lowest possible cost for a browser and finally aol wanted to ensure that its browser would remain fully interoperable with the ubiquitous windows operating system because microsoft was the leading producer of operating systems as well as a competitor through msn of aol aol did not want to have any incompatibility between its products and microsoft or any concern in the marketplace that its software was not fully compatible with windows  throughout the negotiations with microsoft i was aware that microsoft was concerned that aol might choose instead to complete a deal with netscape indeed once microsoft indicated a willingness to consider desktop placement somewhere for aol i sought in the negotiations to obtain as much prominence as possible microsoft refused to provide placement of an aol icon on the desktop itself or to include our software code in its operating system as it had done with msn however microsoft ultimately did agree to provide an aol icon in the online services folder which would reside on the desktop and display a list of internet access providers when a user clicked on it  during the negotiations aol also sought to maintain flexibility in its browser distribution and promotion it was aols objective to have both navigator and internet explorer available to its members allowing them to choose which browser to use microsoft on the other hand attempted to secure exclusive distribution and promotion for internet explorer with no or few exceptions for distribution or promotion of a competitive browser aol ultimately agreed to these restrictions in order to obtain bundling with windows and placement in the online services folder in the end the deal struck with microsoft was a tradeoff aol obtained a form of bundling with the windows  operating system and promotion on the windows  desktop and microsoft obtained virtual exclusivity for its browser on aol preventing aol from providing any significant promotion or distribution of netscapes navigator browser  aol signed its browser agreement with microsoft on march   aol pursuant to this agreement microsoft licensed internet explorer to aol and it became the default browser for use in the aol client software the agreement also provided that the aol software would be distributed along with other online service providers with windows  and with any subsequent consumer windows operating system and also promoted in the online services folder in return the agreement provided for virtual exclusivity in favor of internet explorer on aol aol was only permitted to ship another browser when required by a third party provider distributor or corporate account and only after taking all reasonable efforts to cause the third party to distribute the third party browser on its own even then the number of third party browsers that aol could distribute was limited to less than  of aols total browser shipments  as a result of the microsoft agreement aol must and does strictly limit its distribution promotion and advertising of netscape navigator microsoft has sought to strictly enforce these restrictions and has carefully monitored references to navigator or netscape on the aol service  aol was willing to agree to virtual exclusivity with microsoft  something to which aol would not otherwise have agreed  because aol believed that inclusion in the windows operating system and on the desktop was essential to mitigate at least partially the adverse competitive effects of microsofts bundling of msn with its operating system and because such inclusion had very significant distributional advantages that could not be obtained in any other way  thus aol was concerned about broader competitive issues in its negotiations about a browser license beyond the relative merits of the microsoft and netscape products in particular microsoft through msn was a powerful existing competitor seeking what aol perceived was an unfair competitive advantage through the bundling of msn with its operating system only microsoft had the ability to provide both for msn and aol essentially ubiquitous distribution through the vehicle of the windows operating system aol engaged in these negotiations from that perspective with its goal to enter into an agreement that met its browser needs and was overall the most advantageous to aol and its members the merits of the two browsers  during the negotiations with netscape and microsoft aol employees expressed various views with respect to the merits of the two browsers generally speaking as i mentioned above both navigator and internet explorer were viewed within aol as comparable and in any event superior to aols thenexisting booklink browser netscape had a robust browser that had been tested in the marketplace it had more and better features and was viewed by many as the more important brand in the internet space microsoft on the other hand had a browser that was already componentized but which had not been as thoroughly tested and which was not as robust during the negotiations with the two companies each of them promised to fix the weaknesses that we perceived with their particular browsers aol believed that by the time that aol was ready to use a browser in its next release of its client software the two browsers would be comparable indeed probably essentially indistinguishable  as i noted above componentization was important to aol aol wanted a browser that would connect seamlessly to the aol software consistent with aols desire to provide an aol feel to its members during their online experience even if they were using the browser to access the internet while both the netscape and microsoft browsers would have required some engineering before they could have been integrated into the aol client software the microsoft browser was already componentized because it was aol could connect it to the aol software in a seamless fashion the netscape browser on the other hand was not yet componentized so netscape would have had to develop such a browser for use by aol in the agreement with netscape aol required that netscape componentize its browser at the time it entered into the march  agreement with netscape aol believed that netscape was capable of creating and was prepared to create a componentized browser aols relationship with netscape following the microsoft agreement  aols relationship with netscape necessarily has been affected by aols march  and subsequent agreements with microsoft not surprisingly netscape did not complete its development of a componentized browser given the restrictions in the microsoft agreement that would have sharply limited aols ability to distribute or promote that browser given microsofts refusal to allow aol to give netscape any significant distribution and promotion i understood that netscape did not want to expend the resources necessary to develop a componentized browser specifically for aol and aol did not attempt to enforce that obligation  aol has nevertheless sought to work with netscape to the extent permitted by the microsoft agreements while the parties did enter into an agreement with netscape for the distribution of aols instant messenger email service known as aim in october  the restrictions in the microsoft agreements prevented aol from compensating netscape through distribution or promotion of its browser on the aol service aol aols other agreements with microsoft  since the march   agreement aol has entered into several other agreements with microsoft in so doing aol has had to take into account the fact that microsoft has made various changes in its windows operating system and desktops that would likely have the effect of diminishing the value to aol of the terms of the march  agreement and thus increasing the relative competitive advantages that msn and microsofts other more recent online service offerings enjoy in competition with aol the promotional services agreement on october   aol and microsoft entered into an additional promotional agreement for internet explorer known as the promotional services agreement this agreement was subsequently amended on december   aol aol pursuant to this agreement microsoft agreed to pay aol  per member for each member that aol successfully converted to internet explorer from another browser in addition microsoft agreed to pay aol  if aol succeeded in converting a substantial portion of its installed base to internet explorer by a certain date aol during these negotiations i was told that microsoft had no limitations on what it could spend to gain market share for internet explorer aol  this agreement added additional obligations for aol to exclusively promote the internet explorer in particular locations on the aol browser on cdroms of the aol client software and on sales material related to the aol  product  i understood that converting the installed base of aol users to internet explorer was an important goal for microsoft the active desktop agreement aol entered into the active desktop marketing promotion and distribution agreement with microsoft in september  aol release  of internet explorer included a socalled channel bar on the desktop that points to content and services that were both already available on the computer and that have links out to the internet if a user sought to use one of those links and did not already have an internet service provider the user would automatically be sent to the socalled internet connection wizard icw which takes the user to a referral server that included promotions for a number of internet service providers because this channel bar would be present on the desktop it would make it easier for consumers to reach certain content and services that were linked to the channel bar and thus seemed likely to provide those entities included on the channel bar with a competitive advantage over those entities that were not included in the channel bar  aol believed that the practical effect of the active desktop was to reduce the effectiveness of the online services folder by pushing it down to a lower and less visible level aol was concerned that microsofts purpose in doing this was at least in part to dilute the benefits that aol had bargained for in the march  agreement at the time aol believed that the channel bar and active desktop would be more successful than they have been and believed that since msn would be immediately available on the desktop and prominently displayed in the channel bar it was important that aol be included in the channel bar as well aol aol aol  in order to obtain this position in the channel bar aol agreed to a variety of additional restrictions on its ability to promote and distribute certain other browsers including navigator for example the agreement prohibited aol from  promoting navigator within aol web sites with a limited exception for paid advertising and from compensating netscape for marketing distributing or promoting aol content the windows  referral server agreement in windows  microsoft introduced the internet referral server irs accessed through the icw this placed an icon on the windows  desktop with equal prominence to the online services folder if a user clicked on the icon they would be directed to the icw which would then launch a series of icw screens to lead a user through the process of selecting an internet service provider  aol and microsoft negotiated over aols inclusion in the internet referral server and ultimately signed an agreement in february  ms  the agreement secured placement for aol in the internet referral server accessed through the icw for windows  although for various reasons that has not yet been implemented aol was required to pay a persubscriber bounty to microsoft for the right to be included in the irs the windows  icw agreement  in windows  when a user first starts a new computer a welcome screen appears which includes four links one of which is to the icw that screen will continue appearing until the user clicks on all four links and completes the tasks related thereto or affirmatively prevents the screen from reappearing as was the case with windows  the icw would take the user to a referral server from which the user could initiate service with such a provider the windows  icw had the effect of further reducing the visibility and value of the online services folder to aol since it was interposed before the desktop on which the online services folder resides in fact aols perception was that one of microsofts objectives was to further reduce the distributional protections that aol had bargained for in march of  for all these reasons aol felt that it was even more important to be included as one of the providers in the referral server this was particularly true because of microsofts continuing efforts to promote its own online services businesses including msn on the desktop and to make it easy for consumers to access them aol continued to believe that it needed to have as close to comparable exposure as possible to whatever microsoft online services microsoft was seeking to promote  because of this concern aol entered into the internetsign up wizard referral agreement with microsoft in october  pursuant to this agreement aol will be one of many internet service providers included in the icw but aol will have a slightly different treatment with respect to how a user gets connected to aol than is the case for other internet service providers aols present intentions regarding browsers  aols march  agreement with microsoft continues for several years but aol can elect at the end of this year not to continue the exclusivity and online service folder provisions in the  microsoft agreement at this point navigator and internet explorer continue to be reasonably comparable browser solutions particularly since microsoft is a direct and significant competitor to aol aol would be inclined to license the netscape browser at least to provide it as an option to aol members given the importance of continuing to be included in the windows operating system and desktop however aols present intention is to opt to continue with the provisions of the  microsoft agreement for several reasons first microsoft has demanded that aol continue with these exclusivity provisions or lose the right of compuserve to be included in the online services folder and the icw and for aol to continue to be listed in the referral server second microsofts increased presence in the browser market has left netscape at least at this point in a weakened state third aol continues to want to ensure to the extent possible that there will be neither real interoperability problems between the windows operating system and aol nor any perception in the marketplace that this could occur conclusion  aol would not have been willing to negotiate a browser license with microsoft had microsoft not been willing to bundle and promote aol in its windows operating system and on its desktop and aol would not have been prepared to accept the restrictions on its distribution and promotion of netscape navigator had microsoft not insisted on those restrictions as an element of the licensing agreement while aol viewed the netscape and microsoft browsers as comparable and in each case an improvement over aols booklink browser distribution and promotion in the windows operating systems was something that netscape simply could not provide Â  s david martin colburn wa vlprinted   updated august   search antitrust division
