external links history charles c alderton the originator of dr pepper the us patent office recognizes december   as the first time dr pepper was servedcitation needed it was introduced nationally in the united states at the  louisiana purchase exposition as a new kind of soda pop made with  flavors its introduction in  preceded the introduction of cocacola by one year dr pepper ad from  it was formulated by brooklynborn pharmacist charles alderton in morrisons old corner drug store in waco texas to test his new drink he first offered it to store owner wade morrison who also found it to his liking patrons at morrisons soda fountain soon learned of aldertons new drink and began ordering a waco alderton gave the formula to morrison who named it dr pepper later stylized as dr pepper as with cocacola the formula for dr pepper is a trade secret and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate dallas banks a persistent rumor since the s is that the drink contains prune juice but the official dr pepper faq refutes this with dr pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors it does not contain prune juice the origin of the rumor is unknown some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juices laxative effects but it may simply be because many people feel that dr peppers unique flavor tastes similar to prune juice name theories abound about the origins of the soft drinks name one conjecture is the pep refers to pepsin in  an old ledger book filled with formulas and recipes was discovered by bill waters while shopping at antiques stores in the texas panhandle several sheets and letterheads hinted it had come from the wb morrison  co old corner drug store the same store where dr pepper was first served in  and faded letters on the books cover spelled out castles formulas john castles was a partner of morrisons for a time and worked at that location as early as  one recipe in the book titled d peppers pepsin bitters was of particular interest and some speculated it could be an early recipe for dr pepper however dr pepper snapple group insists it is not the formula for dr pepper but is instead a medicinal recipe for a digestive aid the book was put up for auction in may  but no one purchased it like many early sodas the drink was marketed as a brain tonic and energizing pickmeup so another theory holds that it was named for the pep it supposedly gave to users others believe the drink was named after a real dr pepper one candidate is dr charles t pepper of rural retreat virginia who may have been so honored by morrison either for having granted him permission to marry dr peppers daughter or in gratitude to pepper for having given morrison his first job however morrison lived nearly  miles from rural retreat and peppers daughter was only eight years old at the time morrison moved to waco another possibility is dr pepper of christiansburg virginia us census records show a young morrison working as a pharmacy clerk in christiansburg one of the following pages of this census supposedly shows a dr pepper and daughter malinda or malissa age  since census takers of the period were walking door to door and their census entries were on following pages it seems likely that morrison and the family of dr pepper did not live very far from each other name formatting glass bottle of dr pepper featuring the s logo the period full stop after dr was discarded for stylistic and legibility reasons in the s dr peppers logo was redesigned and the text in this new logo was slanted the period made dr look like di after having been used intermittently in previous logos followed by some debate the period was removed permanently legal and trade history in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for us asserting that nickel cocacolas were sold below cost and were a restraint of trade in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for trademark infringement based on a soft drink marketed by cocacola called peppo they tried naming it dr pibb which was also determined to violate the trademark the soft drink was later renamed mr pibb dr pepper became insolvent in the early s prompting an investment group to take the company private several years later cocacola attempted to acquire dr pepper but was blocked from doing so by the federal trade commission ftc around the same time seven up was acquired from phillip morris by the same investment company that bailed out dr pepper upon the failure of the cocacola merger dr pepper and seven up merged creating dr pepperseven up inc or dpsu giving up international branding rights in the process after the dpsu merger cocacola obtained most nonus rights to the dr pepper name with pepsico taking the seven up rights dr pepper was a frequent player in the s antitrust history of the united states as part of these activities economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that dr pepper is a pepper flavored drink and not a cola in  the ftc blocked a merger between the cocacola company and dr pepper on grounds that included concerns about a monopoly of the pepper flavor

texas jones had made deals with dr pepper and the other companies that the league said violated their exclusive marketing contracts with cocacola and other businesses the nfl agreed to allow jones and other teams to pursue their own agreements in  the pepper flavor soda category was a major part of the analysis supporting an antitrust case between cocacola and pepsi varieties dietary brands dietetic dr pepper was introduced in  cans and  bottles sales were slow partly due to the public misconception that the drink was for diabetics and in  the company renamed the product sugar free dr pepper the name was changed to diet dr pepper in  in  diet dr pepper was reformulated to use aspartame according to cadbury schweppes diet dr pepper after posting a  gain in sales volume became the th

caffeinefree version of diet dr pepper citing company research that indicated a need for a product to fill a niche for the healthconscious consumer originally introduced in only six states the pepper free brand lasted for only three years and was phased out in  while a caffeinefree dietetic product continues to be produced under various name permutations the reason for pulling the pepper free brand are unknown but could have been due to confusion with the rival pepsi free brand currently caffeinefree pepsi caffeine free dr pepper not diet was first released in  due to the success of pepper

heritage began  became available around november  in various outlets around the united states as its name implies it is a rerelease of sorts of dr peppers original formula which uses sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup which dr pepper and other brands of soft drink started to use around the early s the formula of heritage dr pepper and dublin dr pepper are assumed to be one and the same but heritage dr pepper is a larger scale national release aimed at capturing the same marketing essence as the pepsi and mountain dew throwbacks dr pepper made with real sugar was released to commemorate the drinks th anniversary during the summer of  it featured the use of real sugar which was likely a mix of cane and beet sugar as opposed to its usual high fructose corn syrup this version of the soda featured six collectable oz cans and a oz plastic bottle decorated with dr peppers old slogans and images from the s dr pepper vanilla float began  a summertime limited edition run of dr pepper with a vanilla ice cream taste available in ounce bottles liter bottles and ounce  packs uk variation united kingdoms version of dr pepper along with various other countries is manufactured with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup much like heritage dr pepper in the us as mentioned above since august  a new improved flavour has been marketed in the uk that reduces the amount of sugar from g per ml to g while adding artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame k dr pepper zero began  as coca cola distribute dr pepper in the united kingdom a zero version was introduced meaning no added sugarlow calorie but maintaining a taste more in line with regular dr pepper than its diet variant german variation germanys version of dr pepper similar to its uk version is also manufactured with a reduced amount of sugar and artificial sweeteners also aspartame and acesulfame k however the sugar is reduced to g per ml marginally less than in the united kingdom sweeteners much of the soft drink industry in the united states stopped using sugar in the s in response to a series of price supports and import quotas introduced beginning in  that increased the price of sugar above the global market price as a result most us soft drinks including dr pepper now use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar a handful of united states bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten dr pepper the dr pepper bottling plant in dublin texas used to produce such a beverage known as dublin dr pepper in the s plant owner wp bill kloster june   – september   refused to convert the plant to high fructose corn syrup other bottlers still using sugar include temple bottling company in temple texas abtex in abilene and west jefferson dr pepper wjdp of west jefferson nc on march   cocacola bottlers in the dr pepper heartland commenced sales of  ounce cans of dr pepper made with cane sugar and featuring a logo with old doc on them this product was scheduled to be a limited time release in january  heritage dr pepper became available in select markets in cans and  oz bottles with the distinction made with real sugar beginning in july  dr peppers th anniversary edition in some markets was made with sugar as opposed to other sweeteners since dr pepper corporate has no control over whether the bottlers will use sugar there is no guarantee the soda will have sugar as of january  the bottling plant in dublin texas is no longer bottling dr pepper the soft drink industry in some other countries never stopped using sugar as a sweetener for instance in the european union high fructose corn syrup is subject to a production quota in  this quota was set at  tons in comparison the eu produced an average of  million tons of sugar annually between  and  therefore most european soft drink producers including most dr pepper bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten their products however the bottlers of dr pepper in germany and the united kingdom use instead a combination of sugar and artificial sweeteners distribution in the united states dr pepper snapple group does not have a complete network of bottlers and distributors so the drink is sometimes bottled under contract by cocacola or pepsi bottlers prior to the initial cadbury schweppes investmentturnedbuyout  of dr pepperseven up products were produced and distributed by pepsi bottlers and another  by cocacola bottlers the remaining  were produced and distributed by independent bottlers mainly consisting of dr pepperseven up premerger regional bottlers and the dr pepperseven up bottling group currently the majority of pepsi and coke bottlers bottling dr pepper are owned by pepsico and the cocacola company after their buyouts of their major bottlers presently dr pepper snapple relies on its own bottling group to bottle and distribute its products in more than  states cocacola and pepsi have essentially stopped bottling and distributing csab products in favor of inhouse alternatives although regional exceptions can be found in canada and poland cadburyschweppes has licensed distribution rights to pepsico in mexico germany sweden the netherlands slovakia finland austria czech republic belgium and norway cadburyschweppes owns the trademark and distributes the product in romania it can be found only in larger cities imported from belgium in portugal spain france turkey and greece it is almost impossible to find as it is usually imported from the united kingdom in particular supermarkets in almost all of the other countries of the world the cocacola company purchased the trademark from cadburyschweppes and distributes the product this mixed worldwide ownership of the trademark is due to antitrust regulations which prevented cocacola from purchasing the rights everywhere dr pepper is

dr pepper was servedcitation needed it was introduced nationally in the united states at the  louisiana purchase exposition as a new kind of soda pop made with  flavors its introduction in  preceded the introduction of cocacola by one year dr pepper ad from  it was formulated by brooklynborn pharmacist charles alderton in morrisons old corner drug store in waco texas to test his new drink he first offered it to store owner wade morrison who also found it to his liking patrons at morrisons soda fountain soon learned of aldertons new drink and began ordering a waco alderton gave the formula to morrison who named it dr pepper later stylized as dr pepper as with cocacola the formula for dr pepper is a trade secret and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate dallas banks a persistent rumor since the s is that the drink contains prune juice but the official dr pepper faq refutes this with dr pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors it does not contain prune juice the origin of the rumor is unknown some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juices laxative effects but it may simply be because many people feel that dr peppers unique flavor tastes similar to prune juice name theories abound about the origins of the soft drinks name one conjecture is the pep refers to pepsin in  an old ledger book filled with formulas and recipes was discovered by bill waters while shopping at antiques stores in the texas panhandle several sheets and letterheads hinted it had come from the wb morrison  co old corner drug store the same store where dr pepper was first served in  and faded letters on the books cover spelled out castles formulas john castles was a partner of morrisons for a time and worked at that location as early as  one recipe in the book titled d peppers pepsin bitters was of particular interest and some speculated it could be an early recipe for dr pepper however dr pepper snapple group insists it is not the formula for dr pepper but is instead a medicinal recipe for a digestive aid the book was put up for auction in may  but no one purchased it like many early sodas the drink was marketed as a brain tonic and energizing pickmeup so another theory holds that it was named for the pep it supposedly gave to users others believe the drink was named after a real dr pepper one candidate is dr charles t pepper of rural retreat virginia who may have been so honored by morrison either for having granted him permission to marry dr peppers daughter or in gratitude to pepper for having given morrison his first job however morrison lived nearly  miles from rural retreat and peppers daughter was only eight years old at the time morrison moved to waco another possibility is dr pepper of christiansburg virginia us census records show a young morrison working as a pharmacy clerk in christiansburg one of the following pages of this census supposedly shows a dr pepper and daughter malinda or malissa age  since census takers of the period were walking door to door and their census entries were on following pages it seems likely that morrison and the family of dr pepper did not live very far from each other name formatting glass bottle of dr pepper featuring the s logo the period full stop after dr was discarded for stylistic and legibility reasons in the s dr peppers logo was redesigned and the text in this new logo was slanted the period made dr look like di after having been used intermittently in previous logos followed by some debate the period was removed permanently legal and trade history in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for us asserting that nickel cocacolas were sold below cost and were a restraint of trade in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for trademark infringement based on a soft drink marketed by cocacola called peppo they tried naming it dr pibb which was also determined to violate the trademark the soft drink was later renamed mr pibb dr pepper became insolvent in the early s prompting an investment group to take the company private several years later cocacola attempted to acquire dr pepper but was blocked from doing so by the federal trade commission ftc around the same time seven up was acquired from phillip morris by the same investment company that bailed out dr pepper upon the failure of the cocacola merger dr pepper and seven up merged creating dr pepperseven up inc or dpsu giving up international branding rights in the process after the dpsu merger cocacola obtained most nonus rights to the dr pepper name with pepsico taking the seven up rights dr pepper was a frequent player in the s antitrust history of the united states as part of these activities economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that dr pepper is a pepper flavored drink and not a cola in  the ftc blocked a merger between the cocacola company and dr pepper on grounds that included concerns about a monopoly of the pepper flavor category of soft drinks in  dr pepper was involved in an antitrust case involving jerry jones the dallas cowboys nfl properties nike and other commercial interests active at texas stadium in irving texas jones had made deals with dr pepper and the other companies that the league said violated their exclusive marketing contracts with cocacola and other businesses the nfl agreed to allow jones and other teams to pursue their own agreements in  the pepper flavor soda category was a major part of the analysis supporting an antitrust case between cocacola and pepsi varieties dietary brands dietetic dr pepper was introduced in  cans and  bottles sales were slow partly due to the public misconception that the drink was for diabetics and in  the company renamed the product sugar free dr pepper the name was changed to diet dr pepper in  in  diet dr pepper was reformulated to use aspartame according to cadbury schweppes diet dr pepper after posting a  gain in sales volume became the th bestselling soda in  according to beverage digest magazine from  to  the beverage was marketed using the slogan

the healthconscious consumer originally introduced in only six states the pepper free brand lasted for only three years and was phased out in  while a caffeinefree dietetic product continues to be produced under various name permutations the reason for pulling the pepper free brand are unknown but could have been due to confusion with the rival pepsi free brand currently caffeinefree pepsi caffeine free dr pepper not diet was first released in  due to the success of pepper freecontradictory dr pepper ten a lowcalorie version of dr pepper was released in  this version retained the taste

offer dr pepper in place of pibb xtra heritage dr pepper or dr pepper heritage began  became available around november  in various outlets around the united states as its name implies it is a rerelease of sorts of dr peppers original formula which uses sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup which dr pepper and other brands of soft drink started to use around the early s the formula of heritage dr pepper and dublin dr pepper are assumed to be one and the same but heritage dr pepper is a larger scale national release aimed at capturing the same marketing essence as the pepsi and mountain dew throwbacks dr pepper made with real sugar was released to commemorate the drinks th anniversary during the summer of  it featured the use of real sugar which was likely a mix of cane and beet sugar as opposed to its usual high fructose corn syrup this version of the soda featured six collectable oz cans and a oz plastic bottle decorated with dr peppers old slogans and images from the s dr pepper vanilla float began  a summertime limited edition run of dr pepper with a vanilla ice cream taste available in ounce bottles liter bottles and ounce  packs uk variation united kingdoms version of dr pepper along with various other countries is manufactured with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup much like heritage dr pepper in the us as mentioned above since august  a new improved flavour has been marketed in the uk that reduces the amount of sugar from g per ml to g while adding artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame k dr pepper zero began  as coca cola distribute dr pepper in the united kingdom a zero version was introduced meaning no added sugarlow calorie but maintaining a taste more in line with regular dr pepper than its diet variant german variation germanys version of dr pepper similar to its uk version is also manufactured with a reduced amount of sugar and artificial sweeteners also aspartame and acesulfame k however the sugar is reduced to g per ml marginally less than in the united kingdom sweeteners much of the soft drink industry in the united states stopped using sugar in the s in response to a series of price supports and import quotas introduced beginning in  that increased the price of sugar above the global market price as a result most us soft drinks including dr pepper now use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar a handful of united states bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten dr pepper the dr pepper bottling plant in dublin texas used to produce such a beverage known as dublin dr pepper in the s plant owner wp bill kloster june   – september   refused to convert the plant to high fructose corn syrup other bottlers still using sugar include temple bottling company in temple texas abtex in abilene and west jefferson dr pepper wjdp of west jefferson nc on march   cocacola bottlers in the dr pepper heartland commenced sales of  ounce cans of dr pepper made with cane sugar and featuring a logo with old doc on them this product was scheduled to be a limited time release in january  heritage dr pepper became available in select markets in cans and  oz bottles with the distinction made with real sugar beginning in july  dr peppers th anniversary edition in some markets was made with sugar as opposed to other sweeteners since dr pepper corporate has no control over whether the bottlers will use sugar there is no guarantee the soda will have sugar as of january  the bottling plant in dublin texas is no longer bottling dr pepper the soft drink industry in some other countries never stopped using sugar as a sweetener for instance in the european union high fructose corn syrup is subject to a production quota in  this quota was set at  tons in comparison the eu produced an average of  million tons of sugar annually between  and  therefore most european soft drink producers including most dr pepper bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten their products however the bottlers of dr pepper in germany and the united kingdom use instead a combination of sugar and artificial sweeteners distribution in the united states dr pepper snapple group does not have a complete network of bottlers and distributors so the drink is sometimes bottled under contract by cocacola or pepsi bottlers prior to the initial cadbury schweppes investmentturnedbuyout  of dr pepperseven up products were produced and distributed by pepsi bottlers and another  by cocacola bottlers the remaining  were produced and distributed by independent bottlers mainly consisting of dr pepperseven up premerger regional bottlers and the dr pepperseven up bottling group currently the majority of pepsi and coke bottlers bottling dr pepper are owned by pepsico and the cocacola company after their buyouts of their major bottlers presently dr pepper snapple relies on its own bottling group to bottle and distribute its products in more than  states cocacola and pepsi have essentially stopped

mexico germany sweden the netherlands slovakia finland austria czech republic belgium and norway cadburyschweppes owns the trademark and distributes the product in romania it can be found only in larger cities imported from belgium in portugal spain france turkey and greece it is almost impossible to find as it is usually imported from the united kingdom in particular supermarkets in almost all of the other countries of the world the cocacola company purchased the trademark from cadburyschweppes and distributes the product this mixed worldwide ownership of the trademark is due to antitrust regulations which prevented cocacola from purchasing the rights everywhere dr pepper is also available in russia south korea and ukraine although no longer locally bottled in australia or

dr pepper was servedcitation needed it was introduced nationally in the united states at the  louisiana purchase exposition as a new kind of soda pop made with  flavors its introduction in  preceded the introduction of cocacola by one year dr pepper ad from  it was formulated by brooklynborn pharmacist charles alderton in morrisons old corner drug store in waco texas to test his new drink he first offered it to store owner wade morrison who also found it to his liking patrons at morrisons soda fountain soon learned of aldertons new drink and began ordering a waco alderton gave the formula to morrison who named it dr pepper later stylized as dr pepper as with cocacola the formula for dr pepper is a trade secret and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate dallas banks a persistent rumor since the s is that the drink contains prune juice but the official dr pepper faq refutes this with dr pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors it does not contain prune juice the origin of the rumor is unknown some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juices laxative effects but it may simply be because many people feel that dr peppers unique flavor tastes similar to prune juice name theories abound about the origins of the soft drinks name one conjecture is the pep refers to pepsin in  an old ledger book filled with formulas and recipes was discovered by bill waters while shopping at antiques stores in the texas panhandle several sheets and letterheads hinted it had come from the wb morrison  co old corner drug store the same store where dr pepper was first served in  and faded letters on the books cover spelled out castles formulas john castles was a partner of morrisons for a time and worked at that location as early as  one recipe in the book titled d peppers pepsin bitters was of particular interest and some speculated it could be an early recipe for dr pepper however dr pepper snapple group insists it is not the formula for dr pepper but is instead a medicinal recipe for a digestive aid the book was put up for auction in may  but no one purchased it like many early sodas the drink was marketed as a brain tonic and energizing pickmeup so another theory holds that it was named for the pep it supposedly gave to users others believe the drink was named after a real dr pepper one candidate is dr charles t pepper of rural retreat virginia who may have been so honored by morrison either for having granted him permission to marry dr peppers daughter or in gratitude to pepper for having given morrison his first job however morrison lived nearly  miles from rural retreat and peppers daughter was only eight years old at the time morrison moved to waco another possibility is dr pepper of christiansburg virginia us census records show a young morrison working as a pharmacy clerk in christiansburg one of the following pages of this census supposedly shows a dr pepper and daughter malinda or malissa age  since census takers of the period were walking door to door and their census entries were on following pages it seems likely that morrison and the family of dr pepper did not live very far from each other name formatting glass bottle of dr pepper featuring the s logo the period full stop after dr was discarded for stylistic and legibility reasons in the s dr peppers logo was redesigned and the text in this new logo was slanted the period made dr look like di after having been used intermittently in previous logos followed by some debate the period was removed permanently legal and trade history in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for us asserting that nickel cocacolas were sold below cost and were a restraint of trade in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for trademark infringement based on a soft drink marketed by cocacola called peppo they tried naming it dr pibb which was also determined to violate the trademark the soft drink was later renamed mr pibb dr pepper became insolvent in the early s prompting an investment group to take the company private several years later cocacola attempted to acquire dr pepper but was blocked from doing so by the federal trade commission ftc around the same time seven up was acquired from phillip morris by the same investment company that bailed out dr pepper upon the failure of the cocacola merger dr pepper and seven up merged creating dr pepperseven up inc or dpsu giving up international branding rights in the process after the dpsu merger cocacola obtained most nonus rights to the dr pepper name with pepsico taking the seven up rights dr pepper was a frequent player in the s antitrust history of the united states as part of these activities economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that dr pepper is a pepper flavored drink and not a cola in  the ftc blocked a merger between the cocacola company and dr pepper on grounds that included concerns about a monopoly of the pepper flavor category of soft drinks in  dr pepper was involved in an antitrust case involving jerry jones the dallas cowboys nfl properties nike and other commercial interests active at texas stadium in irving texas jones had made deals with dr pepper and the other companies that the league said violated their exclusive marketing contracts with cocacola and other businesses the nfl agreed to allow jones and other teams to pursue their own agreements in  the pepper flavor soda category was a major part of the analysis supporting an antitrust case between cocacola and pepsi varieties dietary brands dietetic dr pepper was introduced in  cans and  bottles sales were slow partly due to the public misconception that the drink was for diabetics and in  the company renamed the product sugar free dr pepper the name was changed to diet dr pepper in  in  diet dr pepper was reformulated to use aspartame according to cadbury schweppes diet dr pepper after posting a  gain in sales volume became the th bestselling soda in  according to beverage digest magazine from  to  the beverage was marketed using the slogan

the healthconscious consumer originally introduced in only six states the pepper free brand lasted for only three years and was phased out in  while a caffeinefree dietetic product continues to be produced under various name permutations the reason for pulling the pepper free brand are unknown but could have been due to confusion with the rival pepsi free brand currently caffeinefree pepsi caffeine free dr pepper not diet was first released in  due to the success of pepper freecontradictory dr pepper ten a lowcalorie version of dr pepper was released in  this version retained the taste

rerelease of sorts of dr peppers original formula which uses sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup which dr pepper and other brands of soft drink started to use around the early s the formula of heritage dr pepper and dublin dr pepper are assumed to be one and the same but heritage dr pepper is a larger scale national release aimed at capturing the same marketing essence as the pepsi and mountain dew throwbacks dr pepper made with real sugar was released to commemorate the drinks th anniversary during the summer of  it featured the use of real sugar which was likely a mix of cane and beet sugar as opposed to its usual high fructose corn syrup this version of the soda featured six collectable oz cans and a oz plastic bottle decorated with dr peppers old slogans and images from the s dr pepper vanilla float began  a summertime limited edition run of dr pepper with a vanilla ice cream taste available in ounce bottles liter bottles and ounce  packs uk variation united kingdoms version of dr pepper along with various other countries is manufactured with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup much like heritage dr pepper in the us as mentioned above since august  a new improved flavour has been marketed in the uk that reduces the amount of sugar from g per ml to g while adding artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame k dr pepper zero began  as coca cola distribute dr pepper in the united kingdom a zero version was introduced meaning no added sugarlow calorie but maintaining a taste more in line with regular dr pepper than its diet variant german variation germanys version of dr pepper similar to its uk version is also manufactured with a reduced amount of sugar and artificial sweeteners also aspartame and acesulfame k however the sugar is reduced to g per ml marginally less than in the united kingdom sweeteners much of the soft drink industry in the united states stopped using sugar in the s in response to a series of price supports and import quotas introduced beginning in  that increased the price of sugar above the global market price as a result most us soft drinks including dr pepper now use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar a handful of united states bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten dr pepper the dr pepper bottling plant in dublin texas used to produce such a beverage known as dublin dr pepper in the s plant owner wp bill kloster june   – september   refused to convert the plant to high fructose corn syrup other bottlers still using sugar include temple bottling company in temple texas abtex in abilene and west jefferson dr pepper wjdp of west jefferson nc on march   cocacola bottlers in the dr pepper heartland commenced sales of  ounce cans of dr pepper made with cane sugar and featuring a logo with old doc on them this product was scheduled to be a limited time release in january  heritage dr pepper became available in select markets in cans and  oz bottles with the distinction made with real sugar beginning in july  dr peppers th anniversary edition in some markets was made with sugar as opposed to other sweeteners since dr pepper corporate has no control over whether the bottlers will use sugar there is no guarantee the soda will have sugar as of january  the bottling plant in dublin texas is no longer bottling dr pepper the soft drink industry in some other countries never stopped using sugar as a sweetener for instance in the european union high fructose corn syrup is subject to a production quota in  this quota was set at  tons in comparison the eu produced an average of  million tons of sugar annually between  and  therefore most european soft drink producers including most dr pepper bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten their products however the bottlers of dr pepper in germany and the united kingdom use instead a combination of sugar and artificial sweeteners distribution in the united states dr pepper snapple group does not have a complete network of bottlers and distributors so the drink is sometimes bottled under contract by cocacola or pepsi bottlers prior to the initial cadbury schweppes investmentturnedbuyout  of dr pepperseven up products were produced and distributed by pepsi bottlers and another  by cocacola bottlers the remaining  were produced and distributed by independent bottlers mainly consisting of dr pepperseven up premerger regional bottlers and the dr pepperseven up bottling group currently the majority of pepsi and coke bottlers bottling dr pepper are owned by pepsico and the cocacola company after their buyouts of their major bottlers presently dr pepper snapple relies on its own bottling group to bottle and distribute its products in more than  states cocacola and pepsi have essentially stopped bottling and distributing csab products in favor of inhouse alternatives although regional exceptions can be found in canada and poland cadburyschweppes has licensed distribution rights to pepsico in mexico germany sweden the netherlands slovakia finland austria czech republic belgium and norway cadburyschweppes owns the trademark and distributes the product in romania it can be found only in larger cities imported from belgium in portugal spain france turkey and greece it is almost impossible to find as it is usually imported from the united kingdom in particular supermarkets in almost all of the other countries of the world the cocacola company purchased the trademark from cadburyschweppes and distributes the product this mixed worldwide ownership of the trademark is due to antitrust regulations which prevented cocacola from purchasing the rights everywhere dr pepper is also available in russia south korea and ukraine although no longer locally bottled in australia or

dr pepper was servedcitation needed it was introduced nationally in the united states at the  louisiana purchase exposition as a new kind of soda pop made with  flavors its introduction in  preceded the introduction of cocacola by one year dr pepper ad from  it was formulated by brooklynborn pharmacist charles alderton in morrisons old corner drug store in waco texas to test his new drink he first offered it to store owner wade morrison who also found it to his liking patrons at morrisons soda fountain soon learned of aldertons new drink and began ordering a waco alderton gave the formula to morrison who named it dr pepper later stylized as dr pepper as with cocacola the formula for dr pepper is a trade secret and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate dallas banks a persistent rumor since the s is that the drink contains prune juice but the official dr pepper faq refutes this with dr pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors it does not contain prune juice the origin of the rumor is unknown some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juices laxative effects but it may simply be because many people feel that dr peppers unique flavor tastes similar to prune juice name theories abound about the origins of the soft drinks name one conjecture is the pep refers to pepsin in  an old ledger book filled with formulas and recipes was discovered by bill waters while shopping at antiques stores in the texas panhandle several sheets and letterheads hinted it had come from the wb morrison  co old corner drug store the same store where dr pepper was first served in  and faded letters on the books cover spelled out castles formulas john castles was a partner of morrisons for a time and worked at that location as early as  one recipe in the book titled d peppers pepsin bitters was of particular interest and some speculated it could be an early recipe for dr pepper however dr pepper snapple group insists it is not the formula for dr pepper but is instead a medicinal recipe for a digestive aid the book was put up for auction in may  but no one purchased it like many early sodas the drink was marketed as a brain tonic and energizing pickmeup so another theory holds that it was named for the pep it supposedly gave to users others believe the drink was named after a real dr pepper one candidate is dr charles t pepper of rural retreat virginia who may have been so honored by morrison either for having granted him permission to marry dr peppers daughter or in gratitude to pepper for having given morrison his first job however morrison lived nearly  miles from rural retreat and peppers daughter was only eight years old at the time morrison moved to waco another possibility is dr pepper of christiansburg virginia us census records show a young morrison working as a pharmacy clerk in christiansburg one of the following pages of this census supposedly shows a dr pepper and daughter malinda or malissa age  since census takers of the period were walking door to door and their census entries were on following pages it seems likely that morrison and the family of dr pepper did not live very far from each other name formatting glass bottle of dr pepper featuring the s logo the period full stop after dr was discarded for stylistic and legibility reasons in the s dr peppers logo was redesigned and the text in this new logo was slanted the period made dr look like di after having been used intermittently in previous logos followed by some debate the period was removed permanently legal and trade history in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for us asserting that nickel cocacolas were sold below cost and were a restraint of trade in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for trademark infringement based on a soft drink marketed by cocacola called peppo they tried naming it dr pibb which was also determined to violate the trademark the soft drink was later renamed mr pibb dr pepper became insolvent in the early s prompting an investment group to take the company private several years later cocacola attempted to acquire dr pepper but was blocked from doing so by the federal trade commission ftc around the same time seven up was acquired from phillip morris by the same investment company that bailed out dr pepper upon the failure of the cocacola merger dr pepper and seven up merged creating dr pepperseven up inc or dpsu giving up international branding rights in the process after the dpsu merger cocacola obtained most nonus rights to the dr pepper name with pepsico taking the seven up rights dr pepper was a frequent player in the s antitrust history of the united states as part of these activities economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that dr pepper is a pepper flavored drink and not a cola in  the ftc blocked a merger between the cocacola company and dr pepper on grounds that included concerns about a monopoly of the pepper flavor category of soft drinks in  dr pepper was involved in an antitrust case involving jerry jones the dallas cowboys nfl properties nike and other commercial interests active at texas stadium in irving texas jones had made deals with dr pepper and the other companies that the league said violated their exclusive marketing contracts with cocacola and other businesses the nfl agreed to allow jones and other teams to pursue their own agreements in  the pepper flavor soda category was a major part of the analysis supporting an antitrust case between cocacola and pepsi varieties dietary brands dietetic dr pepper was introduced in  cans and  bottles sales were slow partly due to the public misconception that the

distribute dr pepper in the united kingdom a zero version was introduced meaning no added sugarlow calorie but maintaining a taste more in line with regular dr pepper than its diet variant german variation germanys version of dr pepper similar to its uk version is also manufactured with a reduced amount of sugar and artificial sweeteners also aspartame and acesulfame k however the sugar is reduced to g per ml marginally less than in the united kingdom sweeteners much of the soft drink industry in the united states stopped using sugar in the s in response to a series of price supports and import quotas introduced beginning in  that increased the price of sugar above the global market price as a result most us soft drinks including dr pepper now use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar a handful of united states bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten dr pepper the dr pepper bottling plant in dublin texas used to produce such a beverage known as dublin dr pepper in the s plant owner wp bill kloster june   – september   refused to convert the plant to high fructose corn syrup other bottlers still using sugar include temple bottling company in temple texas abtex in abilene and west jefferson dr pepper wjdp of west jefferson nc on march   cocacola bottlers in the dr pepper heartland commenced sales of  ounce cans of dr pepper made with cane sugar and featuring a logo with old doc on them this product was scheduled to be a limited time release in january  heritage dr pepper became available in select markets in cans and  oz bottles with the distinction made with real sugar beginning in july  dr peppers th anniversary edition in some markets was made with sugar as opposed to other sweeteners since dr pepper corporate has no control over whether the bottlers will use sugar there is no guarantee the soda will have sugar as of january  the bottling plant in dublin texas is no longer bottling dr pepper the soft drink industry in some other countries never stopped using sugar as a sweetener for instance in the european union high fructose corn syrup is subject to a production quota in  this quota was set at  tons in comparison the eu produced an average of  million tons of sugar annually between  and  therefore most european soft drink producers including most dr pepper bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten their products however the bottlers of dr pepper in germany and the united kingdom use instead a combination of sugar and artificial sweeteners distribution in the united states dr pepper snapple group does not have a complete network of bottlers and distributors so the drink is sometimes bottled under contract by cocacola or pepsi bottlers prior to the initial cadbury schweppes investmentturnedbuyout  of dr pepperseven up products were produced and distributed by pepsi bottlers and another  by cocacola bottlers the remaining  were produced and distributed by independent bottlers mainly consisting of dr pepperseven up premerger regional bottlers and the dr pepperseven up bottling group currently the majority of pepsi and coke bottlers bottling dr pepper are owned by pepsico and the cocacola company after their buyouts of their major bottlers presently dr pepper snapple relies on its own bottling group to bottle and distribute its products in more than  states cocacola and pepsi have essentially stopped bottling and distributing csab products in favor of inhouse alternatives although regional exceptions can be found in canada and poland cadburyschweppes has licensed distribution rights to pepsico in mexico germany sweden the netherlands slovakia finland austria czech republic belgium and norway cadburyschweppes owns the trademark and distributes the product in romania it can be found only in

all of the other countries of the world the cocacola company purchased the trademark from cadburyschweppes and distributes the product this mixed worldwide ownership of the trademark is due to

dr pepper was servedcitation needed it was introduced nationally in the united states at the  louisiana purchase exposition as a new kind of soda pop made with  flavors its introduction in  preceded the introduction of cocacola by one year dr pepper ad from  it was formulated by brooklynborn pharmacist charles alderton in morrisons old corner drug store in waco texas to test his new drink he first offered it to store owner wade morrison who also found it to his liking patrons at morrisons soda fountain soon learned of aldertons new drink and began ordering a waco alderton gave the formula to morrison who named it dr pepper later stylized as dr pepper as with cocacola the formula for dr pepper is a trade secret and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate dallas banks a persistent rumor since the s is that the drink contains prune juice but the official dr pepper faq refutes this with dr pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors it does not contain prune juice the origin of the rumor is unknown some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juices laxative effects but it may simply be because many people feel that dr peppers unique flavor tastes similar to prune juice name theories abound about the origins of the soft drinks name one conjecture is the pep refers to pepsin in  an old ledger book filled with formulas and recipes was discovered by bill waters while shopping at antiques stores in the texas panhandle several sheets and letterheads hinted it had come from the wb morrison  co old corner drug store the same store where dr pepper was first served in  and faded letters on the books cover spelled out castles formulas john castles was a partner of morrisons for a time and worked at that location as early as  one recipe in the book titled d peppers pepsin bitters was of particular interest and some speculated it could be an early recipe for dr pepper however dr pepper snapple group insists it is not the formula for dr pepper but is instead a medicinal recipe for a digestive aid the book was put up for auction in may  but no one purchased it like many early sodas the drink was marketed as a brain tonic and energizing pickmeup so another theory holds that it was named for the pep it supposedly gave to users others believe the drink was named after a real dr pepper one candidate is dr charles t pepper of rural retreat virginia who may have been so honored by morrison either for having granted him permission to marry dr peppers daughter or in gratitude to pepper for having given morrison his first job however morrison lived nearly  miles from rural retreat and peppers daughter was only eight years old at the time morrison moved to waco another possibility is dr pepper of christiansburg virginia us census records show a young morrison working as a pharmacy clerk in christiansburg one of the following pages of this census supposedly shows a dr pepper and daughter malinda or malissa age  since census takers of the period were walking door to door and their census entries were on following pages it seems likely that morrison and the family of dr pepper did not live very far from each other name formatting glass bottle of dr pepper featuring the s logo the period full stop after dr was discarded for

mountain dew throwbacks dr pepper made with real sugar was released to commemorate the drinks th anniversary during the summer of  it featured the use of real sugar which was likely a mix of cane and beet sugar as opposed to its usual high fructose corn syrup this version of the soda featured six collectable oz cans and a oz plastic bottle decorated with dr peppers old slogans and images from the s dr pepper vanilla float began  a summertime limited edition run of dr pepper with a vanilla ice cream taste available in ounce bottles liter bottles and ounce  packs uk variation united kingdoms version of dr pepper along with various other countries is manufactured with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup much like heritage dr pepper in the us as mentioned above since august  a new improved flavour has been marketed in the uk that reduces the amount of sugar from g per ml to g while adding artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame k dr pepper zero began  as coca cola distribute dr pepper in the united kingdom a zero version was introduced meaning no added sugarlow calorie but maintaining a taste more in line with regular dr pepper than its diet variant german variation germanys version of dr pepper similar to its uk version is also manufactured with a reduced amount of sugar and artificial sweeteners also aspartame and acesulfame k however the sugar is reduced to g per ml marginally less than in the united kingdom sweeteners much of the soft drink industry in the united states stopped using sugar in the s in response to a series of price supports and import quotas introduced beginning in  that increased the price of sugar above the global market price as a result most us soft drinks including dr pepper now use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar a handful of united states bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten dr pepper the dr pepper bottling plant in dublin texas used to produce such a beverage known as dublin dr pepper in the s plant owner wp bill kloster june   – september   refused to convert the plant to high fructose corn syrup other bottlers still using sugar include temple bottling company in temple texas abtex in

with real sugar beginning in july  dr peppers th anniversary edition in some markets was made with sugar as opposed to other sweeteners since dr pepper corporate has no control over whether the bottlers will use sugar there is no guarantee the soda will have sugar as of january  the bottling plant in dublin texas is no longer bottling dr pepper the soft drink industry in some other countries never stopped using sugar as a sweetener for instance in the european union high fructose corn syrup is subject to a production quota in  this quota was set at  tons in comparison the eu produced an average of  million tons of sugar annually between  and  therefore most european soft drink producers including most dr pepper bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten their products however the bottlers of dr pepper in germany and the united kingdom use instead a combination of sugar and artificial sweeteners distribution in the united states dr pepper snapple group does not have a complete network of bottlers and distributors so the drink is sometimes bottled under contract by cocacola or pepsi bottlers prior to the initial cadbury schweppes investmentturnedbuyout  of dr pepperseven up

all of the other countries of the world the cocacola company purchased the trademark from cadburyschweppes and distributes the product this mixed worldwide ownership of the trademark is due to

dr pepper was servedcitation needed it was introduced nationally in the united states at the  louisiana purchase exposition as a new kind of soda pop made with  flavors its introduction in  preceded the introduction of cocacola by one year dr pepper ad from  it was formulated by brooklynborn pharmacist charles alderton in morrisons old corner drug store in waco texas to test his new drink he first offered it to store owner wade morrison who also found it to his liking patrons at morrisons soda fountain soon learned of aldertons new drink and began ordering a waco alderton gave the formula to morrison who named it dr pepper later stylized as dr pepper as with cocacola the formula for dr pepper is a trade secret and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate dallas banks a persistent rumor since the s is that the drink contains prune juice but the official dr pepper faq refutes this with dr pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors it does not contain prune juice the origin of the rumor is unknown some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juices laxative effects but it may simply be because many people feel that dr peppers unique flavor tastes similar to prune juice name theories abound about the origins of the soft drinks name one conjecture is the pep refers to pepsin in  an old ledger book filled with formulas and recipes was discovered by bill waters while shopping at antiques stores in the texas panhandle several sheets and letterheads hinted it had come from the wb morrison  co old corner drug store the same store where dr pepper was first served in  and faded letters on the books cover spelled out castles formulas john castles was a partner of morrisons for a time and worked at that location as early as  one recipe in the book titled d peppers pepsin bitters was of particular interest and some speculated it could be an early recipe for dr pepper however dr pepper snapple group insists it is not the formula for dr pepper but is instead a medicinal recipe for a digestive aid the book was put up for auction in may  but no one purchased it like many early sodas the drink was marketed as a brain tonic and energizing pickmeup so another theory holds that it was named for the pep it supposedly gave to users others believe the drink was named after a real dr pepper one candidate is dr charles t pepper of rural retreat virginia who may have been so honored by morrison either for having granted him permission to marry dr peppers daughter or in gratitude to pepper for having given morrison his first job however morrison lived nearly  miles from rural retreat and peppers daughter was only eight years old at the time morrison moved to waco another possibility is dr pepper of christiansburg virginia us census records show a young morrison working as a pharmacy clerk in christiansburg one of the following pages of this census supposedly shows a dr pepper and daughter malinda or malissa age  since census takers of the period were walking door to door and their census entries were on following pages it seems likely that morrison and the family of dr pepper did not live very far from each other name formatting glass bottle of dr pepper featuring the s logo the period full stop after dr was discarded for stylistic and legibility reasons in the s dr peppers logo was redesigned and the text in this new logo was slanted the period made dr look like di after having been used intermittently in previous logos followed by some debate the period was removed permanently legal and trade history in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for us asserting that nickel cocacolas were sold below cost and were a restraint of trade in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for trademark infringement based on a soft drink marketed by cocacola called peppo they tried naming it dr pibb which was also determined to violate the trademark the soft drink was later renamed mr pibb dr pepper became insolvent in the early s prompting an investment group to take the company private several years later cocacola attempted to acquire dr pepper but was blocked from doing so by the federal trade commission ftc around the same time seven up was acquired from phillip morris by the same investment company that bailed out dr pepper upon the failure of the cocacola merger dr pepper and seven up merged creating dr pepperseven up inc or dpsu giving up international branding rights in the process after the dpsu merger cocacola obtained most nonus rights to the dr pepper name with pepsico taking the seven up rights dr pepper was a frequent player in the s antitrust history of the united states as part of these activities economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that dr pepper is a pepper flavored drink and not a cola in  the ftc blocked a merger between the cocacola company and dr pepper on grounds that included concerns about a monopoly of the pepper flavor category of soft drinks in  dr pepper was involved in an antitrust case involving jerry jones the dallas cowboys nfl properties nike and other commercial interests active at texas stadium in irving texas jones had made deals with dr pepper and the other companies that the league said violated their exclusive marketing contracts with cocacola and other businesses the nfl agreed to allow jones and other teams to pursue their own agreements in  the pepper flavor soda category was a major part of the analysis supporting an antitrust case between cocacola and pepsi varieties dietary brands dietetic dr pepper was introduced in  cans and  bottles sales were slow partly due to the public misconception that the

the healthconscious consumer originally introduced in only six states the pepper free brand lasted for only three years and was phased out in  while a caffeinefree dietetic product continues to be produced under various name permutations the reason for pulling the pepper free brand are unknown but could have been due to confusion with the rival pepsi free brand currently caffeinefree pepsi

rerelease of sorts of dr peppers original formula which uses sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup which dr pepper and other brands of soft drink started to use around the early s the formula of heritage dr pepper and dublin dr pepper are assumed to be one and the same but heritage dr pepper is a larger scale national release aimed at capturing the same marketing essence as the pepsi and mountain dew throwbacks dr pepper made with real sugar was released to commemorate the drinks th anniversary during the summer of  it featured the use of real sugar which was likely a mix of cane and beet sugar as opposed to its usual high fructose corn syrup this version of the soda featured six collectable oz cans and a oz plastic bottle decorated with dr peppers old slogans and images from the s dr pepper vanilla float began  a summertime limited edition run of dr pepper with a vanilla ice cream taste available in ounce bottles liter bottles and ounce  packs uk variation united kingdoms version of dr pepper along with various other countries is manufactured with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup much like heritage dr pepper in the us as mentioned above since august  a new improved flavour has been marketed in the uk that reduces the amount of sugar from g per ml to g while adding artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame k dr pepper zero began  as coca cola distribute dr pepper in the united kingdom a zero version was introduced meaning no added sugarlow calorie but maintaining a taste more in line with regular dr pepper than its diet variant german variation germanys version of dr pepper similar to its uk version is also manufactured with a reduced amount of sugar and artificial sweeteners also aspartame and acesulfame k however the sugar is reduced to g per ml marginally less than in the united kingdom sweeteners much of the soft drink industry in the united states stopped using sugar in the s in response to a series of price supports and import quotas introduced beginning in  that increased the price of sugar above the global market price as a result most us soft drinks including dr pepper now use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar a handful of united states bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten dr pepper the dr pepper bottling plant in dublin texas used to produce such a beverage known as dublin dr pepper in the s plant owner wp bill kloster june   – september   refused to convert the plant to high fructose corn syrup other bottlers still using sugar include temple bottling company in temple texas abtex in

logo with old doc on them this product was scheduled to be a limited time release in january  heritage dr pepper became available in select markets in cans and  oz bottles with the distinction made with real sugar beginning in july  dr peppers th anniversary edition in some markets was made with sugar as opposed to other sweeteners since dr pepper corporate has no control over whether the bottlers will use sugar there is no guarantee the soda will have sugar as of january  the bottling plant in dublin texas is no longer bottling dr pepper the soft drink industry in some other countries never stopped using sugar as a sweetener for instance in the european union high fructose corn syrup is subject to a production quota in  this quota was set at  tons in comparison the eu produced an average of  million tons of sugar annually between  and  therefore most european soft drink producers including most dr pepper bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten their products however the bottlers of dr pepper in germany and the united kingdom use instead a combination of sugar and artificial sweeteners distribution in the united states dr pepper snapple group does not have a complete network of bottlers and distributors so the drink is sometimes bottled under contract by cocacola or pepsi bottlers prior to the initial cadbury schweppes investmentturnedbuyout  of dr pepperseven up products were produced and distributed by pepsi bottlers and another  by cocacola bottlers the remaining  were produced and distributed by independent bottlers mainly consisting of dr pepperseven up premerger regional bottlers and the dr pepperseven up bottling group currently the majority of pepsi and coke bottlers bottling dr pepper are owned by pepsico and the cocacola company after their buyouts of their major bottlers presently dr pepper snapple relies on its own bottling group to bottle and distribute its products in more than  states cocacola and pepsi have essentially stopped

larger cities imported from belgium in portugal spain france turkey and greece it is almost impossible to find as it is usually imported from the united kingdom in particular supermarkets in almost all of the other countries of the world the cocacola company purchased the trademark from cadburyschweppes and distributes the product this mixed worldwide ownership of the trademark is due to antitrust regulations which prevented cocacola from purchasing the rights everywhere dr pepper is also available in russia south korea and ukraine although no longer locally bottled in australia or

dr pepper was servedcitation needed it was introduced nationally in the united states at the  louisiana purchase exposition as a new kind of soda pop made with  flavors its introduction in  preceded the introduction of cocacola by one year dr pepper ad from  it was formulated by brooklynborn pharmacist charles alderton in morrisons old corner drug store in waco texas to test his new drink he first offered it to store owner wade morrison who also found it to his liking patrons at morrisons soda fountain soon learned of aldertons new drink and began ordering a waco alderton gave the formula to morrison who named it dr pepper later stylized as dr pepper as with cocacola the formula for dr pepper is a trade secret and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate dallas banks a persistent rumor since the s is that the drink contains prune juice but the official dr pepper faq refutes this with dr pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors it does not contain prune juice the origin of the rumor is unknown some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juices laxative effects but it may simply be because many people feel that dr peppers unique flavor tastes similar to prune juice name theories abound about the origins of the soft drinks name one conjecture is the pep refers to pepsin in  an old ledger book filled with formulas and recipes was discovered by bill waters while shopping at antiques stores in the texas panhandle several sheets and letterheads hinted it had come from the wb morrison  co old corner drug store the same store where dr pepper was first served in  and faded letters on the books cover spelled out castles formulas john castles was a partner of morrisons for a time and worked at that location as early as  one recipe in the book titled d peppers pepsin bitters was of particular interest and some speculated it could be an early recipe for dr pepper however dr pepper snapple group insists it is not the formula for dr pepper but is instead a medicinal recipe for a digestive aid the book was put up for auction in may  but no one purchased it like many early sodas the drink was marketed as a brain tonic and energizing pickmeup so another theory holds that it was named for the pep it supposedly gave to users others believe the drink was named after a real dr pepper one candidate is dr charles t pepper of rural retreat virginia who may have been so honored by morrison either for having granted him permission to marry dr peppers daughter or in gratitude to pepper for having given morrison his first job however morrison lived nearly  miles from rural retreat and peppers daughter was only eight years old at the time morrison moved to waco another possibility is dr pepper of christiansburg virginia us census records show a young morrison working as a pharmacy clerk in christiansburg one of the following pages of this census supposedly shows a dr pepper and daughter malinda or malissa age  since census takers of the period were walking door to door and their census entries were on following pages it seems likely that morrison and the family of dr pepper did not live very far from each other name formatting glass bottle of dr pepper featuring the s logo the period full stop after dr was discarded for stylistic and legibility reasons in the s dr peppers logo was redesigned and the text in this new logo was slanted the period made dr look like di after having been used intermittently in previous logos followed by some debate the period was removed permanently legal and trade history in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for us asserting that nickel cocacolas were sold below cost and were a restraint of trade in  dr pepper sued the cocacola company for trademark infringement based on a soft drink marketed by cocacola called peppo they tried naming it dr pibb which was also determined to violate the trademark the soft drink was later renamed mr pibb dr pepper became insolvent in the early s prompting an investment group to take the company private several years later cocacola attempted to acquire dr pepper but was blocked from doing so by the federal trade commission ftc around the same time seven up was acquired from phillip morris by the same investment company that bailed out dr pepper upon the failure of the cocacola merger dr pepper and seven up merged creating dr pepperseven up inc or dpsu giving up international branding rights in the process after the dpsu merger cocacola obtained most nonus rights to the dr pepper name with pepsico taking the seven up rights dr pepper was a frequent player in the s antitrust history of the united states as part of these activities economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that dr pepper is a pepper flavored drink and not a cola in  the ftc blocked a merger between the cocacola company and dr pepper on grounds that included concerns about a monopoly of the pepper flavor category of soft drinks in  dr pepper was involved in an antitrust case involving jerry jones the dallas cowboys nfl properties nike and other commercial interests active at texas stadium in irving texas jones had made deals with dr pepper and the other companies that the league said violated their exclusive marketing contracts with cocacola and other businesses the nfl agreed to allow jones and other teams to pursue their own agreements in  the pepper flavor soda category was a major part of the analysis supporting an antitrust case between cocacola and pepsi varieties dietary brands dietetic dr pepper was introduced in  cans and  bottles sales were slow partly due to the public misconception that the drink was for diabetics and in  the company renamed the product sugar free dr pepper the name was changed to diet dr pepper in  in  diet dr pepper was reformulated to use aspartame according to cadbury schweppes diet dr pepper after posting a  gain in sales volume became the th bestselling soda in  according to beverage digest magazine from  to  the beverage was marketed using the slogan

the healthconscious consumer originally introduced in only six states the pepper free brand lasted for only three years and was phased out in  while a caffeinefree dietetic product continues to be produced under various name permutations the reason for pulling the pepper free brand are unknown but could have been due to confusion with the rival pepsi free brand currently caffeinefree pepsi caffeine free dr pepper not diet was first released in  due to the success of pepper freecontradictory dr pepper ten a lowcalorie version of dr pepper was released in  this version retained the taste

offer dr pepper in place of pibb xtra heritage dr pepper or dr pepper heritage began  became available around november  in various outlets around the united states as its name implies it is a rerelease of sorts of dr peppers original formula which uses sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup which dr pepper and other brands of soft drink started to use around the early s the formula of heritage dr pepper and dublin dr pepper are assumed to be one and the same but heritage dr pepper is a larger scale national release aimed at capturing the same marketing essence as the pepsi and mountain dew throwbacks dr pepper made with real sugar was released to commemorate the drinks th anniversary during the summer of  it featured the use of real sugar which was likely a mix of cane and beet sugar as opposed to its usual high fructose corn syrup this version of the soda featured six collectable oz cans and a oz plastic bottle decorated with dr peppers old slogans and images from the s dr pepper vanilla float began  a summertime limited edition run of dr pepper with a vanilla ice cream taste available in ounce bottles liter bottles and ounce  packs uk variation united kingdoms version of dr pepper along with various other countries is manufactured with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup much like heritage dr pepper in the us as mentioned above since august  a new improved flavour has been marketed in the uk that reduces the amount of sugar from g per ml to g while adding artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame k dr pepper zero began  as coca cola distribute dr pepper in the united kingdom a zero version was introduced meaning no added sugarlow calorie but maintaining a taste more in line with regular dr pepper than its diet variant german variation germanys version of dr pepper similar to its uk version is also manufactured with a reduced amount of sugar and artificial sweeteners also aspartame and acesulfame k however the sugar is reduced to g per ml marginally less than in the united kingdom sweeteners much of the soft drink industry in the united states stopped using sugar in the s in response to a series of price supports and import quotas introduced beginning in  that increased the price of sugar above the global market price as a result most us soft drinks including dr pepper now use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar a handful of united states bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten dr pepper the dr pepper bottling plant in dublin texas used to produce such a beverage known as dublin dr pepper in the s plant owner wp bill kloster june   – september   refused to convert the plant to high fructose corn syrup other bottlers still using sugar include temple bottling company in temple texas abtex in abilene and west jefferson dr pepper wjdp of west jefferson nc on march   cocacola bottlers in the dr pepper heartland commenced sales of  ounce cans of dr pepper made with cane sugar and featuring a logo with old doc on them this product was scheduled to be a limited time release in january  heritage dr pepper became available in select markets in cans and  oz bottles with the distinction made with real sugar beginning in july  dr peppers th anniversary edition in some markets was made with sugar as opposed to other sweeteners since dr pepper corporate has no control over whether the bottlers will use sugar there is no guarantee the soda will have sugar as of january  the bottling plant in dublin texas is no longer bottling dr pepper the soft drink industry in some other countries never stopped using sugar as a sweetener for instance in the european union high fructose corn syrup is subject to a production quota in  this quota was set at  tons in comparison the eu produced an average of  million tons of sugar annually between  and  therefore most european soft drink producers including most dr pepper bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten their products however the bottlers of dr pepper in germany and the united kingdom use instead a combination of sugar and artificial sweeteners distribution in the united states dr pepper snapple group does not have a complete network of bottlers and distributors so the drink is sometimes bottled under contract by cocacola or pepsi bottlers prior to the initial cadbury schweppes investmentturnedbuyout  of dr pepperseven up products were produced and distributed by pepsi bottlers and another  by cocacola bottlers the remaining  were produced and distributed by independent bottlers mainly consisting of dr pepperseven up premerger regional bottlers and the dr pepperseven up bottling group currently the majority of pepsi and coke bottlers bottling dr pepper are owned by pepsico and the cocacola company after their buyouts of their major bottlers presently dr pepper snapple relies on its own bottling group to bottle and distribute its products in more than  states cocacola and pepsi have essentially stopped

all of the other countries of the world the cocacola company purchased the trademark from cadburyschweppes and distributes the product this mixed worldwide ownership of the trademark is due to antitrust regulations which prevented cocacola from purchasing the rights everywhere dr pepper is also available in russia south korea and ukraine although no longer locally bottled in australia or

recommendbydebbievon august  format paperbackverified purchasedavid peppers novel the peoples house is a well crafted page turner he has deep insight into politics on a local and national level i grew up near several of the cities mentioned mr pepper captures the local flavor perfectly the plot is well developed with lots of interesting twists and turns there are some themes that are eerily resonant with the current political environment it was a fun read  and i learned a lot about how political districts are shapedcommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert

later out of  starstoo welltimedbypmon december  format paperbackverified purchasewhile on the surface it appeared as the perfect light holiday read combining my love of politics and mysteries the reality was that it hit a bit too close to home with all that has happened in this election it was eerily prescient and depressingly relevant but i did get hooked and hope well see more of the characters in future novels now if only the election reform that ends the book were to happen in real lifecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the
