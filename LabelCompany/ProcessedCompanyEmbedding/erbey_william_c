tweetreddit stumbleuponemailprint email this article to a friend your email your name recipients email comma separated message captcha even as erbeys power has grown so too has the number of homeowners complaining about how their mortgages have been serviced—close to  since  according to the consumer financial protection board william c erbey the executive chairman of ocwen financial is a billionaire with a problem after years of homeowner grievances ocwen has become ground zero for regulatory shelling by government agencies—and some members of the investment community aren’t happy with erbey either what do all these folks have against the yearold erbey who cut his financial teeth as head of ge capital’s mortgage insurance unit in the early s after all he looks kindly enough more like a s encyclopedia salesman than the head honcho of the countrys largest nonbank mortgage servicer the problem it seems is that even as erbey’s power has grown so too has the number of homeowners complaining about how their mortgages have been serviced—close to  since  according to the consumer financial protection board cfpb in december  the cfpb teamed up with authorities from  states to force ocwen to settle allegations that the servicer refused to honor agreements with previous servicers improperly denied homeowners loan modifications and levied unauthorized fees and penalties upon them  according to richard cordray head of the cfpb “ocwen took advantage of borrowers at every stage of the process” in response cordray and his allies ordered the company to provide  billion in the form of principal loan reductions to homeowners struggling to stay afloat there was also a provision that  million in refunds be set aside to pay the approximately  people whose properties had already been foreclosed upon though the settlement didn’t force ocwen to actually admit to wrongdoing it was just the latest round in a series of escalating regulatory actions that have put erbey and his empire in an increasingly unflattering public light erbey’s tangled woven web now william c erbey isn’t the kind of guy who likes to spend his considerable wealth on the accoutrements of high living it’s wellknown in the industry that his allworknoplay approach to business has paid off in spades allowing him to create a matrix of companies that focus on the millions of americans over their heads in mortgage debt in addition to ocwen financial—a servicer which collects monthly mortgage payments modifies loans and initiates foreclosures—erbey is chairman of the board and the largest shareholder for four other real estate companies that step in when a foreclosedupon resident steps out there’s altisource portfolio solutions which runs hubzucom a realestate site that bills itself as “the easy way to buy and sell homes online” and where a former homeowner’s now bankowned property can join tens of thousands of others like it for a quick downanddirty sale or there’s altisource residential corporation which might decide to repurpose a home as a rental property after acquiring it through a foreclosure auction or directly from the foreclosed home’s investor altisource asset management offers reinsurance and title services and home loan servicing solutions exists only as a holding company that purchases assets from—you guessed it—ocwen and erbey knows how to save a corporate tax buck or two ocwen and altisource asset management are sheltered in an economic development zone in the virgin islands altisource portfolio solutions and altisource residential corporation call luxembourg home and home loan servicing solutions is headquartered in the caymans  erbey’s efforts in creating a mortgageservicing domain have certainly made him the envy of more than one billionaire investor including leon cooperman the scion of the heavyweight hedge fund omega advisors who called him “brilliant” in a recent new york times article  but new york’s increasingly muscular department of financial services helmed by a young former prosecutor named benjamin lawsky has been watching erbey too this february in a letter sent to ocwen’s chief counsel lawsky “raised the possibility that management has the opportunity and incentive to make decisions concerning ocwen that are intended to benefit the share price of affiliated companies resulting in harm to borrowers mortgage investors or ocwen shareholders as a result” lawsky also mused that “a tangled web of conflicts could create incentives that harm borrowers and push homeowners unduly into foreclosure” according to some critics ocwen has been doing just that deliberately edging americans into defaulting on their loans so that those other jewels in erbey’s corporate crown can prosper  ocwen denies that there’s any sort of “misery hedging” taking place a spokesperson told the new york times that the corporation keeps a “strictly armslength business relationship” with altisource but try telling that to brad smith a georgia resident who visited a house he owned that was in default with ocwen but not yet in foreclosure when he arrived on january  smith says he found the doors smashed and the locks rekeyed despite the fact that he had clearly posted notices indicating the house was not abandoned and certainly not ready for the foreclosure auction those notices also included contact information smith says he never got a headsup he did however find a note from the company that did the handiwork altisource  according to homeowner advocate chris wyatt who’s examined erbey’s dealings extensively for two years one of the real estate services provided by altisource is socalled “property preservation” when it comes to major bank mortgage services corporations such as wells chase and bank of america often outsource services like property inspections foreclosure sales auctions and rentals to independent thirdparty companies to prevent any perception of impropriety relating to the servicing and disposition of the loan but for erbeys customers wyatt says the homeowner’s fate and the fate of their home are frequently controlled by any one of his companies giving special meaning to altisource’s motto “thinking ahead delivering today” wyatt claims this business strategy gives erbey’s empire a leg up so to speak regarding which homes in the ocwen portfolio are about to go into foreclosure if altisource has access to this knowledge—including how much is owed by the homeowner the value of the collateral and the condition of the property—it could then make certain decisions about the disposition of the property that will maximize profits for one or all of the corporations these are presumably questions that lawsky will be looking into as he investigates the possible links among them this comes on the heels of other lawskydriven initiatives including a december  demand that ocwen place an independent compliance monitor inside the company to make sure it conformed to agreements designed to put an end to any “servicing practices that were depriving homeowners of the opportunity to avoid foreclosure” and in february of this year lawsky paired his warning with action he halted the transfer of some  billion worth of mortgage servicing rights msrs from wells fargo to ocwen until assurances are given that the company could properly service this new wave of homeowners a problem which has plagued ocwen for years homeowners still suffering likely thanks to the regulatory action by new york’s dfs and cfpb ocwen’s stock valuations have taken quite the hit between the first of the year and the end of february the company dropped nearly  percent in value that’s resonated with some heavyweights in the mutual fund world like blackrock and pimco who aren’t thrilled by the prospect of losing any shareholder income as the result of principal reductions for underwater homeowners memorialized in the december  cfpb settlement recently the association of mortgage investors claimed that the settlement was “potentially harmful to mortgage bond owners” and promised some action down the pike “look for a forthcoming letter to trustees master servicers” it announced on twitter and in a rather amusing turn on march  a californiabased hedge fund called glaucus research—an investor in altisource residential—posted a video online using a familiar clip from the movie “downfall” to parody erbeys investment strategy glaucus has also threatened to sue altisource residentials independent directors as ocwen struggles to satisfy regulators and investors however there are still some  million homeowners currently on the servicer’s roll—and many of them are still facing problems last november i documented the plight of three specific ocwen clients trying to survive foreclosure proceedings on their homes all three are still floundering around waiting for answers  wyatt who has been working with those homeowners in addition to others has started a campaign on changeorg to document the trials and tribulations of trying to deal with ocwen representatives with a texas homeowner’s permission wyatt recently recorded a phone call in which the customer tried to clarify some issues arising from charges on his monthly mortgage statement including a  property inspection fee although the invariably polite customer service employee tried to justify the charge as legitimate wyatt later pointed out citing his own experience as a former litton loan servicing executive that a property inspection should have only been carried out if the homeowner was in default with his loan in this case the homeowner was current it gets worse though on the same call the ocwen representative indicated that it would take  hours for the company to process the payment once the homeowner paid via ocwen’s website that’s a nono according to wyatt a servicer is required by law to process a homeowner’s payment on the day it’s received anything else sets up a potential default situation given that a mortgage company could post the payment after the due date on its own the call would have been frustrating enough but when wyatt looked more thoroughly into the homeowner’s statement he found evidence of more miscalculations from ocwen wyatt points out that this homeowner’s current statement—with a modification in place—shows a principal balance owed to ocwen in the amount of  of which  is set aside in an escrow account to pay taxes and associated expenses but the entire modified balance of the loan seems to be inflated because it includes  in late charges that ocwen had agreed to waive under the terms of the modification an excess escrow amount of  and an additional  in unspecified fees and charges in short according to wyatt the homeowner now owes approximately  more than he should under the terms of the loan modification in a second recorded call an ocwen representative confronted by wyatt with the inconsistencies couldn’t offer any compelling justifications for the problems encountered by the homeowner it seemed to echo the oftenbizarre experiences confronting homeowners seeking any information regarding their loans these are the kind of hairpulling stories that no doubt will leave erbey’s empire vulnerable to further inquiries by federal and state regulators  the empire strikes back despite the tumult surrounding erbey he seems to have few plans to retaliate a query to ocwen’s chief spokesperson katarina wenkbodenmiller failed to elicit a response by the deadline but the aforementioned cfpb settlement may not be as devastating to ocwen as it initially appeared as reported by david dayen in the new republic ocwen noted in a regulatory filing after the case that it would actually split the money owed to its foreclosure victims with some of their previous servicers meaning only  million would actually exit ocwen’s coffers    while this may be a silver lining of sorts for the company erbey’s concern right now will likely be surviving ben lawsky’s inquiry into any conflicts of interest surrounding the empire hell also be trying to open the  billion revenue stream of wells fargo servicing that the department of financial services temporarily blocked “we at ocwen are working cooperatively with the new york department of financial services to address its concerns that led to an indefinite hold on our transaction with wells fargo” he’s recently been quoted as saying   but betting on misery isn’t just the province of ocwen the whole mortgage industry remains riddled with problems—and whether they involve accusations of mortgage fraud improper servicing procedures or illegal foreclosures nothing will change until there’s a concerted effort among both regulators and

example having servicing companies as opposed to requiring the owners of the mortgage to service the mortgage introduces a party into the ownership process that can monkey wrench the process businesses love complex transactions and processes as it gives them lots and lots of rules and regulations with which they can cause confusions and take advantage of the buyers an example of this was volkswagon selling an expensive extended warranty which seemed to be pretty good but just happened to leave out any mention of the cars wiring harness electrical issues could all be pinned upon a bad

editors note excerpts from thestreets interviews with bill erbey and billionaire investor wilbur ross are available as separate stories new york  thestreet  soon after bill erbey and his wife elaine moved last year to st croix in the us virgin islands they ran up a  electric bill they turned down the air conditioning in an effort to cut costs and erbey who is  and overweight sat around sweating he lives a lifestyle that if he lived for  years he couldnt spend his net worth says orin kramer general partner of hedge fund boston provident its one of the things that makes someone comfortable as an investor because hes always focused on the dark side focusing on the dark side was of course a good thing to be doing ahead of the subprime housing crisis its one reason erbey who is the chairman of ocwen financial  ocn and four other publiclytraded companies has managed to quintuple his net worth to  billion over the past two years hedge fund manager john paulson and economist nouriel roubini have probably gained more recognition than anyone else for having predicted the us housing crisis but when it comes to building businesses positioned to clean up the mess erbey may be the biggest success so far he is arguably the leading figure in the rise of an industry known as nonbank mortgage servicing which an oppenheimer research report last month called the next evolutionary step in mortgage finance as big banks sharply scale back their involvement in the mortgage market read ocwen chairman bill erbey talks housing if we look back to the s mortgage finance was largely dominated by the savings and loans  from there it shifted to the large banks where it has concentrated until the last few years it seems to make sense that capital needs to step up as the shift takes place to nonbank entities states the report from analysts ben chittenden and chris kotowski a considerable amount of capital has already stepped up and thrown its weight behind erbeys businesses he has a very unusual combination of capabilities says billionaire investor wilbur ross who joined erbey on the board of ocwen after it bought a company called homeward residential for  million in cash and stock from him last year you find some executives who are good strategists but not so good at the details of operation hes good at both and then in addition he has been totally brilliant at capital markets activities you probably havent heard of erbey and even the companies he oversees arent familiar to most people but if youre behind on your mortgage payments you are more likely to be dealing with ocwen and one of its  indiabased call center operators than you are with any other company a mortgage servicer is essentially a debt collector ocwen which specializes in nonperforming loans services  billion of the  trillion in delinquent mortgage loans in the us if you lose your home to foreclosure ocwen may refer it to altisource portfolio solutions  asps to be listed through a web site called hubzucom hubzucom sold about  homes in  generating more than  million in revenue that would make it one of the top  or  realtors in the country according to steve murray president of real trends which tracks the realty industry other foreclosed homes in ocwens inventory are converted to rental property and leased out by altisource residential corp  resi read wilbur ross discusses ocwen chairman bill erbey that sounds relatively simple but the corporate structures that support these and other business activities in the erbey portfolio are not simple three of the companies erbey oversees including altisource residential home loan servicing solutions  hlssand altisource asset management  aamc do not conform to the manonthestreet notion of a company legal structures might be a better way to describe them because the five erbey companies have bland and overlapping names i will refer to all of them except ocwen by their ticker symbols in an attempt to simplify aamc for example has just five fulltime employees it owns a title insurance company and a reinsurer called newsource which has no employees it manages assets for resi the separate publicly listed residential leasing company which also has no employees hlss which has just  employees exists at this point merely to buy assets from ocwen what the five companies have in common is share price appreciation that ranges from marketcrushing to difficulttofathom this last description refers to aamc which is up  since it was spun out of asps in december no that wasnt a typo shares opened at  dec  and were worth  at the close of trading tuesday still ocwen has the largest profits the most employees and the highest public profile of the five companies erbey oversees it also accounts for the largest portion of erbeys net worth at roughly  million i dont ever want to be a bank or a thrift again ocwen was created out of the oxford financial group a company founded by barry wish in  wish lured erbey away from general electrics  ge ge insurance unit to run the leveraged buyout business one of oxfords biggest acquisitions was a  deal for revere copper  brass shortly after its emergence from bankruptcy oxford split up however and erbey and wish were left with a group of assets the most promising of which were first federal savings bank of delaware and investors mortgage insurance co these became the core of ocwen its name which comes from newco spelled backwards is a bit like erbey boring and clever at the same time read foreclosure progress may sputter erbey says he and wish commenced building a business to try to work out nonperforming loans such assets were plentiful as a result of the us savings and loan crisis which flared up periodically from the s until the early s for a period of time in the s ocwen became the largest purchaser of residential nonperforming loans in the industry and the secondlargest buyer of nonperforming commercial mortgage loans erbey says he was better at servicing them than everybody else says an executive at another company who has done business regularly with erbey if the loan pool traded at  cents on the dollar he could pay  cents and make more money than the guy who paid  because servicing  the art of collecting the loans  is such an important component of the value servicing is ocwens principal business today and its growth mainly through acquisitions is the reason ocwens shares have nearly quadrupled since may   servicing was also a big part of ocwens success in the late s and most of the s during that time however ocwen was one of a small number of thrifts that bought nonperforming loans a competitor ran into trouble and erbey says that caused the office of thrift supervision ots to tighten the screws on ocwen the guy at the agency said im not going to lose my pension over having somebody that does that kind of work erbey says he is still clearly annoyed by the recollection thats why i dont ever want to be a bank or a thrift again because someone can come in whos basically a bureaucrat and force him out of a key business this guy only cared about his pension plan the fact that youd even say that shows youre a ret you know not the exactly the brightest guy on the read  big banks showing most book value growth erbey declined to name the official and ellen seidman director of the ots from  declined to comment through a spokesman for the urban institute where she is now a fellow at roughly the same time as its regulatory troubles ocwen had problems of its own making after a bet on interestonly securities went bad erbey and wish bought the securities for  million above market value to make investors whole according to a regulatory filing sterne agee analyst henry coffey cites the transaction as an example of erbeys dedication to his shareholders most of us dont have that kind of capacity or integrity he says erbey singles out the bad bet as the one transaction that i really regret he adds its something that wasnt our core business and i didnt think it was right to do it if you liked this article you might like wall street ends lower as crude slumps french election looms wall street ends
