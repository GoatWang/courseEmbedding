macroeconomic analysis with a bottomup fundamental security analysis as such we utilize an integrated investment process that considers dynamics valuation and sentiment from both topdown macroeconomic and bottomup stock perspectives we believe an integrated process offers the most effective approach given the return and risk potential of this asset class our experience has found that there are
