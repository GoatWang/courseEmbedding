youll find all the components individual stock symbols found in that sector ranking them by their weighted alpha a rating of growth patterns in a oneyear period about weighted alpha weighted alpha is a measure of how much a stock has risen or fallen over a oneyear period the original research was restricted to large cap stocks so the corresponding rise in the sp  index was subtracted however as there are a number of interesting stocks that do not fit well into any category and others that fit into more than one category the results are presented without subtracting any index barchartcom takes this alpha measure of how much a stock has changed in the oneyear period and weights this assigning more weight to recent activity and less  factor to activity at the beginning of the period thus the weighted alpha is a measure of one year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity a stock whose price has risen over the oneyear period will have a positive weighted alpha a stock whose price has not changed in the period will have a small weighted alpha and a stock whose price has dropped over the period will have a negative weighted alpha note the weighted alpha is limited in the amount it may change from one day to the next thus eliminating large price jumps from the calculation add data columns to this table learn about our custom views want to use this as
