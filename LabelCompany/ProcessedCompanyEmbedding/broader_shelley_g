secret weapon shelley broader walmart canada’s new secret weapon she’s the everymom but loves the metal band poison she’s american but gets canada shelley broader is walmart canada’s new ceo—and she’s totally ready to take on target sep   joanna pachner   shelley broader ceo walmart canada photo markian lozowchuk shelley broader has impressive reflexes standing in the produce section of a new walmart supercentre she’s chatting up a family of shoppers when the little boy suddenly chucks a tomato at her she nimbly palms the fruit before it hits the ground or her skirt since this is a photo shoot the cleanup in aisle  would have been captured for the cameras and marked a tearful end to the tyke’s modelling career instead the maneouvre—likely perfected raising her own two kids—draws light applause from her gathered entourage of public relations and store staff she briefly mugs exasperation—seriously this is what i have to do in this job—before gamely returning to smiling and fondling nearby vegetables the supercentre has been carefully chosen for this mise en scène to demonstrate how walmart is arming for the coming war in canadian retail located in brampton on the outer edge of suburban toronto flanked by two subdivisions under construction in a heavily south asian area the yearold site represents walmart’s “store of the community” a kind of minimall customized to local tastes not only does it stock brands the immigrant residents grew up on but features a hair and nail salon a doctor’s office a pharmacy a dry cleaner and a café the large produce section right off the main entrance bordered by a deli counter gives the impression of walking into a standard supermarket broader points out privatelabel tarts part of a recently introduced upmarket line “our buyers are really sophisticated epicureans in many ways” she says not your image of the walmart shopper the company has some surprises in store as it rushes to expand reposition and finetune before target america’s secondlargest discounter arrives here this spring—one of several us chains crowding into canada it’s a seismic event for this country’s retail landscape expected to cause weaker players especially midsize chains to merge or shut down as they get squeezed out of prime locations and undercut in the giants’ price wars the title of a recent retail council of canada study tersely summed up the challenge “the easy days are over” the next six months are a critical time for all the major players “this will be an unusual opportunity for canadian retailers to glue customers to their stores before target opens its sparkling new units” writes perry caicco the respected retail analyst with cibc world markets in a report it is walmart however that faces the most direct collision with target the two companies—both of which celebrated their th anniversaries this year—have long been fierce rivals south of the border target’s offerings are more chic and walmart’s prices tend to be lower but there are significant similarities between the two in store sizes and range of merchandise a recent survey by kubasprimedia of canadian consumers who have shopped at crossborder targets identified walmart as one of two retailers with the most to lose from target’s arrival walmart is hardly running scared for almost two decades it has been successfully fending off incursions from dollar stores and specialty retailers chalking up steady growth and marketshare gains each year while the company has been gearing up for heightened competition for some time this year marks a major acceleration walmart is investing  million into  stores some are new others are revamps of existing sites including conversions of  former zellers outlets it is the company’s largest expansion since it arrived in this country in  and as anyone who’s been to walmart lately has noticed—that would be  of you out there—the biggest change has been in food more than half the stores carry fresh food today and that ratio will grow rapidly walmart’s new strategy will inevitably buffet other retailers as incumbents refocus or shift direction to get out of an incoming rival’s crosshairs their reactions in turn threaten other competitors thus rippling out through the entire industry from loblaws to dollarama to costco everyone is reexamining their game plan—and walmart is doing more of it than anyone “sometimes the reaction of a competitor to the new entrant causes more market disruption than the arrival of the new entrant itself” says caicco “when target arrives walmart’s responses may be more important than anything else in canadian retail” making sure the company defends its canadian turf is broader’s job one the yearold american has kept a pretty low profile since she ascended to the ceo’s chair a year ago but we’ll likely see a lot more of her in the coming months a retailer on a charm offensive couldn’t ask for a better leader her charisma and high energy warm laugh and blond good looks make her the model of walmart’s prime customer the busy mom as she leads a tour of the store offering up key sound bites it seems almost like a jobimposed distraction from what she’d rather be doing chatting up the staff “a supercentre is onestop shopping you can have something to eat you can get a haircut and with the price of gas the idea you can get it all—oh hi how are you” a toy story woody pillow prompts a crack about buying it for her cfo pausing by some ’sthemed apparel she confesses her love for metal band poison andrew pelletier walmart canada’s head of public relations guards her like a bear fully aware that “someone like shelley” is a precious commodity for the often maligned retailer broader isn’t just the cheerleaderinchief of course she runs an billion operation that represents  of the company’s sales outside the us canada is one of the prize markets in the walmart empire one that delivers outsize returns broader is a retail veteran but this is by far her biggest assignment still she knows from personal experience that americans tend to underestimate the retail competition in canada “this is a very complex market” she says “that’s why foreign retailers come here and are often unsuccessful” target you’ve been warned broader’s own career in retail started inauspiciously in the early s in her s and bored with investment banking she decided to make a jump to one of her supermarket clients every hire at hannaford bros a grocery chain in the northeastern united states has to start in a store no matter their eventual position she was working a cash register when she saw a familiar face before her she couldn’t quite place “what are you doing here” said the customer “we signed a multimilliondollar debt deal with you two weeks ago” fumbling for an answer she simply said “i changed careers” broader is telling this story from the podium at a women in influence luncheon last spring for the umpteenth time during her adlibbed speech laughter ripples through the packed hall at the metro convention centre in toronto sporting a chic black suit and cameraready makeup she delivers a mix of personal history and leadership lessons interspersed with genuinely funny selfdeprecating anecdotes it’s easy to picture her as a tv host joshing with guests a kind of kelly ripa her first job in fact after earning a journalism degree was at a small tv station but she didn’t see it satisfying her ambition “so i quit and went home to mom” she got into investment banking by bluffing her way into a small boston firm “do you know what a bond yield curve is” “yes…” “do you invest in the markets” “yes …” when she got the job “never in my life have i studied so hard” she says laughing after a few years she again saw limited room to rise so she switched tracks retail stuck undaunted by bagging groceries and cleaning out grease traps in the meat room she rose from a marketing executive to eventually become ceo of sweetbay supermarket a troubled florida chain owned by hannaford’s parent company stephen smith a marketing executive broader hired at sweetbay who followed her to other companies says the chain’s culture had been “quite abusive” with a rapid succession of leaders and vicious cost cutting “she was full of energy and very human” he recalls “she rebuilt the culture into one of optimism and respect for the individual which is now the walmart line” during that time she came to believe that a leader is always on stage “hugh farrington takes two creams in his coffee” became a mantra based on her close observation of hannaford’s ceo which she used to remind herself and others that staff and customers are constantly watching you in  she became president of north american crafts chain michaels stores which gave her the first taste of the canadian market “i made my canadian retail mistakes at another retailer” she quipped during a walmart press conference earlier this year “one was underestimating the consumers’ price acumen they’re loyal to their family not to your brand” michaels wasn’t a happy time for broader reports a former colleague in earlier positions “she’d had fantastic bosses who had taken chances for her moved her to important roles some thought she wasn’t ready for at michaels she didn’t have that same kind of support system” when walmart beckoned all she knew of the discount giant was that “they wear blue vests and cheer” but her rise has been brisk after working with the sam’s club division in the us she moved to canada as chief merchandise officer in late  though little known in the canadian industry her elevation to country ceo made sense because of her background  years in supermarkets prepared her well to guide walmart’s food expansion as did her sam’s experience with socalled combination stores that stock both food and general merchandise “obviously she’s been tested” says john williams head of retail consultancy j c williams group walmart “moves these people around and she’s been groomed for this and she has david cheesewright not too far away” he says referring to walmart canada’s former ceo who as head of a new regional group is now broader’s boss still williams adds that what really runs walmart is the retailer’s deeply ingrained culture “it’s very rigid and well defined” he says “you either fit in or you don’t very quickly” it goes well beyond sales associate teambuilding gimmicks to an earnest dedication to individual respect family orientation and frugality broader proudly reports that she sits at the beatenup desk walmart inherited from the former president of woolco whenever williams visits a walmart store he says he makes a point of asking staff how they like working there—and is always told they love it broader’s personality and management style have been a snug fit with walmart she’s taken to writing a weekly blog largely taken up with personal observations and family anecdotes to her spouse’s and two schoolage kids’ consternation “these guys feel like they know me and my family” she says of the more than  people toiling for walmart canada “my husband had pneumonia and everyone was asking me how he was doing” employees about  of whom are female often ask her for advice her favourite blog post to date was a response to a recently engaged associate seeking marital tips don’t expect your spouse to change after marriage she offered—and quit dating her informal camaraderie carries into the boardroom but executives quickly learn it shouldn’t be mistaken for softness “she puts people at ease but proceed at your own caution” warns former colleague stephen smith “she’s tough there were a few people in florida that found their way out the door pretty quickly” broader has sharpened her judgment over the years says ron hodge her boss at hannaford and a lifelong mentor “early in her career some of her decisionmaking might have been more emotional than factbased after you’ve made some decisions that didn’t work out based on your hat rather than your head you learn” one of those lessons was to surround herself with experts and make sure they function—this is a favourite leadership analogy of broader’s—like a cabinet rather than a house of representatives “the marketing person isn’t there to represent the province of marketing they’re there to help me run a multinational corporation” although broader was appointed ceo of walmart canada a year ago her real comingout happened six months later when she hosted the annual analyst meeting for walmart international in early april the division comprises the retailer’s  markets outside the us and canada’s selection as host this year was a nobrainer no other market has as much in the works or at stake this was the first time the new canadian chief faced a large contingent of media and industry observers all curious how walmart planned to repel inroads from its big american rival broader and cheesewright faced their interlocutors on a fernlined stage in a toronto hotel he with the trim coiled look of a boxer she radiating feminine glamour in a black suit flashing leg doug macmillan head of walmart international had to make an early exit when news of the bribery scandal in mexico urgently demanded his presence through the gruelling day of presentations and interviews she seemed to lose her cool just once when a tv interview experienced technical difficulties and had to be reshot a touch of steel entered her face “let’s just do it” she snapped over and over she repeated the same messages “food is very close to my heart” “our job is to lower the cost of living for the canadian consumer” not once did she utter the word “target”—not even as a verb but that chain’s presence was heavy in the room and all the plans walmart executives laid out resonated against the coming changes to the retail landscape ever since target acquired most zellers store leases last year in a billion transaction the industry has been preparing for upheaval starting in march the company plans to open roughly  stores nationwide over two years combined with recent or upcoming arrivals from nordstrom marshalls and several other american chains the retail sector is set to become very crowded especially at the discount end after  years in this country walmart has the edge of knowing the consumer broader emphasizes that the canadian discount shopper is a distinct species multicultural well educated and progressive in fact walmart canada shares less than a quarter of its merchandise with us stores canadians also want to know they’re getting a bargain which has forced walmart to adapt its everydaylowprice strategy that eschews sales with regular “rollback” promotions to draw in customers most important says broader “the consumer doesn’t have a stigma about where she shops which is very different than in the us or mexico” cibc’s caicco points out that walmart’s canadian customers are “more aspirational and affluent” than in its home market there those adjectives would better describe target’s customer which brings the question do these people shop at walmart only because target hasn’t been here to serve them walmart will be most vulnerable to target in apparel housewares and other “hardlines”—areas where target’s more fashionforward offerings and chic brand will appeal to the urban middle class in that context a push into food makes a sensible defensive tactic it also offers the advantage of drawing new customers and driving regular visits fresh food is already available in more than half of walmart’s  stores and the company has nearly doubled its grocery market share over the past couple of years while target has teamed up with sobeys to supply it with frozen dairy and dry goods that’s unlikely to threaten walmart’s growing franchise “we are really in our infancy in bringing fresh food to canada” says broader “i intend to put food into every store where it can fit and makes sense” this of course is lousy news for supermarkets whose profits are already being squeezed by price wars and flat sales in the past two years the grocery sector’s share of canadian food purchases declined from  to  mainly to the benefit of mass merchandisers—walmart in particular ed strapagiel a retail consultant with kubasprimedia says this development shouldn’t have come as a surprise to supermarkets as combination stores have been a distinct category in the us for  years the hardesthit so far has been loblaws whose market share has been slipping especially in produce and meat walmart’s massive supercentres won’t be the only outlets selling food earlier this year the company opened a prototype urban store in suburban toronto the location takes half the space of its typical big box yet features almost a full crosssection of a supercentre’s food offerings the company’s acquisition of  zellers sites from target last year gives it an opportunity to experiment with new formats “zellers is a card from every suit in the deck” says broader “it allows us to test smaller boxes” in designing urban and the larger grocery push walmart canada leaned on its uk sister asda which is primarily a grocer combined with its massive purchasing power walmart’s ability to rely on its experience in diverse international markets is something no other retailer can match the result is a “mass customization” approach exploiting the size and scale of being part of a massive multinational but tailoring the product to local customers the “store of the community” concept which will guide many of walmart’s new and refurbished locations is the same idea in microcosm “eighty percent of the stuff is the same cookiecutter so  can be perfect for each market” broader explains back at the brampton supercentre broader shows off other changes in stock ones that hint at an attempt to lure more upmarket shoppers in housewares she oohs over the “can’t beat” price on a sunbeam coffee maker then aahs over an upscale keurig brewing system “walmart is increasingly about national brands” she insists “if you want to pay less for a bosch you should associate it with walmart” in cosmetics the layout highlighting ritzy brands in glass cases mimics what you’d find in drug and department stores broader may never mention a competitor’s name but the message is clear you don’t need to go youknowwhere to find the chic and the now as the industry shakes out over the next three years broader’s success at beating back rivals will undoubtedly be closely watched by walmart brass in bentonville ark getting the top job in canada was “huge” says smith who today heads up marketing for asda “there are two marquee markets for walmart international canada and uk” both divisions have strong growth and profitability mentioning david cheesewright as a case in point smith adds that inside the company “there are definite trajectories that look apparent to everybody for shelley this steps her up nicely for a career in walmart if she wants it” shares share facebook email twitter linkedin advertisement advertisement    show comments hide comments  comments are closed shelley g broader  tampa fl

writer enlarge broader revenue  billion   employees   address  bent branch drive irving   phone   web wwwmichaelscom enlarge broader first job i was a cashier at a gift shop and drug store in spokane washington why retail going into my current line of work was an evolution not a decision i was in finance and i had retail customers one retail opportunity led to another and now here i am job likesdislikes best without a doubt it is the associates michaels has a wonderful creative workbook the associates in the field and at corporate are committed to making michaels “where creativity happens” least what’s there not to love come on people it’s michaels key to success the key to success is leveraging the talent of those around you bringing together a world class team and developing them and trying to be a fully integrated person i want to leverage and improve as a leader merchant mother spouse and friend i try and bring my whole self to work defining moment i can’t boil it down to a single moment there have definitely been stepping stone moments throughout my life that have lead me to where i am there have also been mentoring moments with great coaches the opening of the first store ever for a brand new company was very satisfying greatest challenge like most people life is full of professional and personal challenges you need to make a decision you are going to come out on the other side a stronger and wiser person and then plan accordingly proudest achievement i am most proud of the success of the people i have mentored watching them develop within companies and become great community leaders ultimate career goal my goal is to continue to learn grow as a leader and as a business professional business motto my personal business motto is “lead with yourself” mentors my greatest mentor is my mother she is an amazing woman her quiet strength and determination are an inspiration to me she instilled great values and a sense of responsibility in my brothers and sister and me she is very open minded and current in her way of thinking and in her view of the world rating the market i am new to the dallasfort worth area i have found it to be a welcoming atmosphere loaded with top notch executives industry outlook the craft and hobby industry has faired quite well during this economic down turn we certainly have not come out unscathed but we also haven’t suffered as badly as other retail channels many consumers are turning to home made and staying in with their families and doing projects together best advice be yourself leverage your strengths but be aware of your weaknesses you are ultimately in charge of your own development don’t wait for the official process giving back i am most rewarded by helping a cause in which i am personally connected i have led the effort to merge two aids service organizations and chaired the “go red for women” campaign while living in tampa bay after hours i love to spend time with my husband brian and my two children madison and clay favorite book i enjoy all books and i have very eclectic taste in books i can move from a business history book like giants of enterprise to trying to out pace my daughter through the twilight series on the web i don’t twitter but i am a chronic texter i watch the market through cnbc and hit the news through the usual suspects profile to mirror the passion of michaels’ customers president and chief operating officer shelley broader encourages creativity on the corporate side this includes each department decorating its own space now company headquarters’ walls are covered with murals of eagles ships and houses there are also a few chandeliers “it’s been really fun that’s really the essence of our brand — it’s fun it’s creative it’s lively” broader says “it’s passionate so you can’t have a regularlooking corporate office if you want to inspire those thoughts in your customers” broader who joined the company in june  comes to michaels stores inc during its reinvention to achieve the goal of making the brand customercentric stores are being reorganized to be more accommodating and inspiring the children’s area now includes educational activities in addition to art displays that group all related materials together also include craft ideas this contrasts with stores’ previous organization when customers had to search various sections to find all the supplies they needed brian c cornell michaels’ former chief executive and current president and chief executive of sam’s club recruited broader cornell sees broader as a “key catalyst” in transforming michaels to be more focused on the customer “she’s a very energetic dynamic candid business leader who can manage teams who can strategically identify the key areas of focus for an organization and who can get things done and done in the right way” cornell says besides michaels’ status as a household brand broader says the opportunity to learn a new class of retail led her to move to texas from tampa fla where she was president and chief executive of the sweetbay supermarket chain for  years because she believes it is important to experiment with the products she sells in the past year she’s become a “fledgling crafter” inspired by the jewelry her associates and customers make some of which broader says “will rival a boutique” she recently made a pair of turquoise bead and silverwire earrings “i think i got the bug now i have to go buy a bunch of equipment” broader says her children are also becoming crafters recently the family volunteered to create centerpieces for the auction at yearold madison and yearold clay’s school to fit “the louvre” theme they created  eiffel towers each   feet tall and spray painted gold with feathers on top “when the people from the school came to pick them up they asked ‘where did you get these’ as me and my husband were standing there with bandaids on our fingers” broader says “we were like ‘we made them’” it seems broader’s family is not the only one doing crafts together despite the down economy business at michaels is good “there are certain segments of retail that can not only survive but thrive in a downturn economy” broader says she attributes this to the recession encouraging people to return to their roots “people are sort of reconnecting with home right now and simplifying what they’ve done in the past” broader says “so the products we sell and services we provide fit nicely with that” shelley g broader  chicos fas inc  leadership® profile products resources about client support order
