skip to content menu search business business business juno therapeutics snags m originally published august   at  pm updated august   at  pm juno therapeutics cfo dr steven harr left and hans bishop president and ceo the biotech company just announced  million in financing bringing the total to  million share story by coral garnick seattle times business reporter juno therapeutics the seattle biotechnology startup unveiled in december by leading cancer scientists here and in new york has announced another  million in financing bringing its total funding to  million in less than a year the new funding comes from  public mutual funds and healthcarerelated funds as well as all the major previous investors “the real goal behind this round — beyond it being a financing event — is to forge longterm relationships with investors” hans bishop ceo of juno said in an interview “they are not just investing in clinical development but in scientific questions that we really believe will allow us to make better products in the future” juno is working to develop curative immunotherapy treatments for a variety of highrisk cancers its approach is to bolster a patient’s cancerfighting immune responses by taking tcells which fight infections and cancers in the body out of his or her body and reprogramming them to include receptors to help recognize and kill cancer cells most read

cancers are currently running and bishop said he hopes to start the first trials with solid organ tumors next year the company will also continue to invest in basic research and manufacturing technologies that will allow it to make its products the company with offices in south lake union was formed in partnership with fred hutchinson cancer research center new york’s memorial sloankettering cancer center and seattle children’s research institute it isn’t saying how large a work force it has built with its fat bankroll juno’s initial  million startup financing in the fourth quarter of last year was the nation’s largest earlystage venture deal for that quarter according to a moneytree report released in january by pricewaterhousecoopers and the national venture capital association prior to the current round investors included arch venture partners the alaska permanent fund bezos expeditions and venrock the  deal also accounted for nearly  percent of all the venture funding received by washington companies for the quarter according to moneytree reports for the first and second quarters of this year the company raked in an additional nearly  million juno reports its total series a funding as 7 million “those kinds of raisings are fairly unprecedented … you don’t see companies raise  million in under a year” said chris rivera president and ceo of the washington biotechnology and biomedical association biotech companies can burn through tens of millions of dollars quickly as they recruit scientists and conduct long costly testing of products that are years away from potential revenues the rule of thumb said rivera is that “when you have the opportunity to raise funding you should do it” jeff grabow the us venturecapital leader at ernst  young a globalaccounting and consulting firm agreed he also has a name for funding rounds exceeding  million — mega rounds he calls the current trend in large venturecapital deals a “mega round phenomenon” he said many mega rounds are associated with tech companies because they are easy to fund upfront but need more money to scale up later biotechnology companies like juno on the other hand require a lot of capital at all levels for product development and to get a drug to market he said with the resurgence of biotech companies the market is receptive he said “there is great opportunity to invest in companies like this” he said “we haven’t solved a lot of the problems that afflict man — there is still a lot of work to be done on cancer and other debilitating diseases” the latest  million deal comes five months after juno brought in steve harr as cfo and head of corporate development he previously spent  years at morgan stanley and is credited with managing more than  billion in financing
