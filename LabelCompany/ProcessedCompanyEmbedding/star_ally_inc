experience from this poorly ran organization we have tried the body cameras they do not work we have dvm s and dvm s units and they too do not work properly problem after problem and we have lost evidence because of their poor products when we call the tech support office we are met with friendly staff who are obviously not adequately trained to troubleshoot the issues with such a poor product i feel bad for their ground level employees as they must certainly be frustrated with the lack of leadership within this organization this company is more focused on playing golf and marketing themselves to help first responders the poor service starts with customer care and their unwillingness to do the right things for his customers take a moment to google this company and their fiscal problems before you spend a single moment with customer care manager several employees that proved to be the most helpful no longer work for this company you have to wonder why still waiting on return
