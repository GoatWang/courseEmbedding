natural colors from vegetable juice give it the rich violet color while triple sec lime and natural cane sugar round out the calorie captivating cocktail ruby redarita the ruby red grapefruit was the creation of texan farmers in the ’s who felt that the whiter grapefruit was far less superior to the more pink or red varietal the grapefruit itself is a hybrid originating in barbados as a result of an accidental cross between the sweet orange and the pomelo – and was given the name ‘forbidden fruit’ rich in antioxidants the grapefruit is known for it’s semisweet flavor when combined with nightshade’s premium tequila sugar cane and triple sec it should be anything but forbidden the ruby redarita is the ultimate thirst quenching margarita perfectly enjoyed during the day on the rocks at
