issues give a gift products of the year stereophiles products of  stephen mejias    nov      first published dec   i was sitting in the main listening room of in living stereo a small manhattan hifi shop nestled between greenwich village and the east village when my conversation with store owner steve mishoe turned to the economys current dismal state in the face of slow sales mishoe had noted an encouraging trend because we have less money to spend we want to make sure that what money we do spend goes for products that not only deliver the thrill of something new but also promise enduring quality if this is true then we have reason to celebrate by shifting our focus from the socalled latest and greatest to that which will provide lasting enjoyment we set ourselves up for some real happiness and fun editor john atkinson had this in mind  years ago when he began our products of the year ritual he felt it important to distinguish the truly good products from all the flashy pretenders that too often win the affections of our capricious hearts annually since  then stereophile has named a few choice components as its products of the year we believe these are special products capable of providing musical pleasure far beyond our formal review period to keep the awards procedure straightforward we have just five primary categories loudspeakers including subwoofers amplification components preamplifiers power amplifiers etc digital source components transports processors music servers disc players analog source components phono cartridges turntables tonearms fm tuners etc and accessories all those little extras that keep us busy and satisfied in a more recent tradition each of our writers and editors also gets to declare his favorite product finally the two most important categories are selfexplanatory our overall product of the year is the best of the best and my favorite category budget product of the year leaves us with the most cash to spend on new records the voting went like this each of stereophiles  hardware reviewers and editors was asked to nominate up to six components for each category to be a contender a product had to have been reviewed in one of the  issues of stereophile from november  through october  in a full equipment report a followup review or in one of the regular columns by art dudley michael fremer john marks kalman rubinson and sam tellig that way only those components could be nominated for which a writer had put his opinion in print for public scrutiny we then compiled a ballot form listing all components nominated by three or more writers andor editors this process ensured that most nominees in most categories will have been auditioned by the most reviewers each editor or reviewer gave three votes for his first choice in each category two votes for his second choice and one vote for his third choice if any an unambiguous picture emerged as the votes came in and the winners became clear john atkinson tallied the votesaddress your love letters and hate mail to him at stletterssorccom see jas comments on how the voting process works the prices listed were current as of the end
