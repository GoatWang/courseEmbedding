and the sixth leading cause of death in the united states a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder alzheimer’s usually develops slowly and can get worse over time according to the alzheimer’s association alzheimer’s disease affects approximately  million people in the united states today and the number of patients afflicted with the disease is growing every year by  it is projected that approximately  million people will be living with alzheimer’s disease in the us in 0 total healthcare costs for alzheimer’s and other dementias are estimated to reach  billion in the us alone meanwhile no new treatment options for patients have been approved by the fda for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease since an estimated  of alzheimer’s disease patients age  and older are classified as mildtomoderate which is the patient population axovant is focused on treating with intepirdine rvt0 axovant is currently developing intepirdine in a phase  international multicenter doubleblind placebocontrolled study designed to evaluate the safety tolerability and efficacy of intepirdine in mildtomoderate alzheimer’s disease patients called the mindset studylearn more about mindset × dementia with lewy bodies dlb lewy body dementia or lbd is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the second most common form of dementia lbd is characterized by a buildup of abnormal proteins known as lewy bodies in areas of the brain that control cognition movement alertness and behavior lewy body dementia includes two similar conditions – dementia with lewy bodies or dlb and parkinson’s disease dementia or pdd the primary difference between both conditions generally depends on the timing of the onset of cognitive decline relative to the onset of movementrelated symptoms in dementia with lewy bodies cognitive decline generally occurs within one year of the onset of movement disorder symptoms in parkinson’s disease dementia movement disorder symptoms precede cognitive decline by more than a year along with suffering from impaired cognition and behavioral disturbances lbd patients often suffer from visual hallucinations fluctuations in cognition attention and alertness sensitivity to neuroleptic antipsychotic medications rem behavior disorder or rbd in which people physically act out their dreams and parkinsonism movement disorder with symptoms including muscle rigidity and tremors the lewy body dementia association estimates that there are  million patients with lewy body dementia in the united states our subsidiary axovant is currently developing two drug candidates to treat certain aspects of lewy body dementia – intepirdine rvt0 and nelotanserin currently there are no drugs approved by the fda for the treatment of dlb intepirdine has the potential to be the first drug approved by the fda for the treatment of dlb learn more about mindset × gait and balance impairments in dementia axovant is currently conducting a phase  study to evaluate the effects of intepirdine on gait and balance in patients with alzheimers disease dementia with lewy bodies and parkinsons disease dementia in this study axovant intends to further investigate the observation of a reduced rate of falls seen in patients treated with intepirdine in a prior patient study of intepirdine on a background of stable donepezil therapy × visual hallucinations in lewy body dementia axovant is currently conducting a phase  multicenter doubleblind placebocontrolled crossover study evaluating nelotanserin in patients with lewy body dementia lbd suffering from visual hallucinations the safety efficacy and tolerability of nelotanserin at doses of 0 mg and  mg will be evaluated over a week treatment period in approximately 0 subjects with lbd this is a crossover study so every subject will receive placebo for  weeks and nelotanserin for  weeks but neither patients or their doctor will know which treatment they are taking the primary outcome measure will be safety and tolerability the frequency and severity of visual hallucinations over a week treatment period will be a secondary outcome measure patients who complete the study will be eligible to receive nelotanserin in an extension study learn more here × rem behavior disorder rbd in dlb axovant is currently conducting a phase  multicenter doubleblind placebocontrolled study evaluating nelotanserin in patients with dementia with lewy bodies dlb experiencing rapid eye movement rem sleep behavior disorder rbd the efficacy safety and tolerability of  mg of nelotanserin will be evaluated over a week period in approximately 0 patients with dlb the primary efficacy evaluation will be a change in the frequency of rem sleep behaviors by the end of  weeks patients who complete the study will be eligible to receive nelotanserin in an extension study learn more here × alzheimer’s diseaseaxovant plans to develop and if successful commercialize products that combine cholinesterase inhibitors with peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonists including glycopyrrolate which could mitigate the peripheral side effects of cholinesterase inhibitorsaxovant recently completed a proof of concept study for rvt0 designed to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile safety and tolerability of  mg donepezil plus placebo versus 0 mg of donepezil when given concomitantly with one of three different regimens including either glycopyrrolate or trospium over a 0day period the study measured subject nausea in  healthy elderly subjects using a visual analog scale vas at baseline and once every two hours for eight hours after dosing on days    and 0on the final day of dosing when nausea for subjects in the  mg donepezil plus placebo arm achieved a peak mean change from baseline on the vas subjects in the arms receiving 0 mg donepezil plus either glycopyrrolate or trospium demonstrated a  percent to  percent reduction in nausea relative to the  mg donepezil plus placebo armbased on these results the company expects to meet with the us food and drug administration fda to discuss additional studies that could support registration of rvt0 and expects to initiate a proof of concept study for rvt0 in the second half of 0 × prostate cancer prostate cancer is a malignant transformation of tissue within the male prostate gland often characterized by slow growth prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the united states approximately  million men in the united states are currently living with prostate cancer and  men are newly diagnosed each year symptoms of prostate cancer include increased urinary frequency dysuria hematuria and nocturnal urination current treatments include combinations of surgery radiation or proton beam therapy androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy myovant is currently developing relugolix an oral oncedaily gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh receptor antagonist by inhibiting gnrh receptors in the anterior pituitary gland relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropin luteinizing hormone lh and folliclestimulating hormone fsh leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in men suppression of these hormones improves the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostatespecific antigen psa levels in men with advanced prostate cancer learn more here × uterine fibroidsuterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop from the muscle and connective tissue of the uterus approximately  of women of reproductive age have uterine fibroids and  in  experience symptoms requiring treatment although uterine fibroids are benign tumors they may cause debilitating symptoms including heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding anemia and pelvic pain current treatments include hormonal contraceptives gnrh agonists and surgical interventions including myomectomy and hysterectomymyovant is currently developing relugolix an oral oncedaily gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh receptor antagonist by inhibiting gnrh receptors in the anterior pituitary gland relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropin luteinizing hormone lh and folliclestimulating hormone fsh leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in

symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostatespecific antigen psa levels in men with advanced prostate cancerlearn more here × female infertility approximately  of infertile women have problems related to ovulation including the inability to produce fully matured eggs or release an egg from the ovary ie “ovulate” in the course of treating infertility related to anovulation fertility specialists use a group of medications to temporarily correct ovulatory problems and increase a woman’s chance for pregnancy these and related procedures are broadly termed assisted reproductive technology or art approximately  million cycles of art were performed globally in 0 myovant is currently developing mvt0 an analog of kisspeptin a naturallyoccurring peptide in humans that plays a key role in egg maturation and ovulation by increasing the release of lh and fsh through the stimulation of gnrh secretion recent evidence from trials performed in women undergoing assisted reproduction revealed that the native kisspeptin peptide has the potential to act as an alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin hcg or gnrh agonists in triggering egg maturation an essential step in all assisted reproduction cycles myovant believes that mvt0 may induce the release of lh and fsh in a manner that more closely mimics natural physiology potentially avoiding side effects associated with hcg or gnrh agonist administration including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss learn more here × farber disease farber disease is an ultrarare lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in both alleles of the asah gene resulting in the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase this leads to the accumulation of the proinflammatory sphingolipid ceramide and a macrophage driven inflammatory process causing the development of typical clinical symptoms like many other lysosomal storage diseases farber disease has a broad phenotypic spectrum and is likely underdiagnosed farber patients typically present with the cardinal symptoms of joint contractures or arthritis subcutaneous nodules and weak or hoarse voice it may take years for all three cardinal symptoms to appear together and they may vary greatly in severity patients may also present with systemic inflammation fever severe pain peripheral osteolysis failure to thrive and developmental delay recombinant human acid ceramidase rhac is an enzyme replacement therapy ert under development for the treatment of farber disease initially developed by dr edward schuchman at the

relugolix and our partnership with takeda represent an exceptional foundation on which to build this exciting new company about relugolix relugolix is a oncedaily orally administered potential bestinclass gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh receptor antagonist for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis and a potential best and firstinclass treatment for hormonesensitive prostate cancer hspc  relugolix has been evaluated in over  patients to date and has successfully demonstrated significant clinical benefit and was generally welltolerated across multiple large randomized phase  clinical trials in three different indications takeda is currently enrolling two phase  clinical trials of relugolix for registration in japan for the treatment of uterine fibroids by inhibiting gnrh receptors in the pituitary gland relugolix rapidly reduces circulating sex hormone levels leading to suppression of estrogen and testosterone suppression of these sex hormones improves the symptoms of women with uterine fibroids and endometriosis and decreases prostatespecific antigen psa levels in men with hspc in a patient phase  study for the treatment of uterine fibroids women who received relugolix had a significant reduction in menorrhagia or abnormally heavy bleeding during menstruation in a patient phase  study for the treatment of endometriosis women who received relugolix had a significant reduction in both nonmenstrual and menstrual pelvic pain based on these results two phase  registration studies in women with uterine fibroids are underway in japan nct0 nct0 in two phase  studies in approximately  men with hspc which included control arms of either an injectable gnrh agonist leuprolide acetate or a gnrh antagonist degarelix respectively oral oncedaily relugolix suppressed serum testosterone to castrate levels and decreased psa the safety of relugolix across all phase  studies was generally welltolerated consistent with the mechanism of action the clinical experience to date supported by an extensive preclinical development program suggests that oral relugolix administered oncedaily could be an important advancement in the treatment options available for women suffering from endometriosis and uterine fibroids in addition relugolix could provide men with hspc an important new treatment option as the first oral gnrh receptor antagonist that offers an alternative to injectable therapies about rvt0 rvt0 tak is a kisspeptin analog that acts to stimulate the physiologic release of gnrh and downstream hormones important in fertility such as luteinizing hormone  recent evidence from trials performed in women undergoing invitro fertilization ivf revealed that the native kisspeptin peptide has the potential to act as an alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin hcg or gnrh agonists in triggering egg maturation an essential step in every ivf cycle about myovant sciences myovant sciences is focused on innovative
