to discuss custom research and reporting projects methodology in order to complete the research for this post i made use of a script in r using the rselenium package i have previously published a post about how to set up rselenium using the latest version of selenium and an earlier post reviewing some of the most useful functions in the package this package makes it possible to automate the collection of data from websites the process is called webscraping the nfa assigns pool id numbers in numerical order i start with the most recently identified pool and increment the pool id then search in basic for that pool if the pool is found i record the names and ids of the commodity pool operators i also check for the date the pool ceased trading futures or ceased trading altogether to ensure i do not include dead pools i keep going until i run out of pools i check at least  successive pool ids have no pool associated with them finally for the purpose of this post i purge the list of pool operators who do not appear on my  largest hedge funds master list note that this list includes about 5 firms who are affiliated with the various large hedge fund companies image source
