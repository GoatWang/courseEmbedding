executive trips to the bahamas las vegas and west palm beach florida on the company jet in one note loeb wrote “masseys ceo is provided a companyowned home to live in  in fact after he leaves the company the house is to be given to him as a parting gift no one else at the company gets free housing much less an entire home as a retirement gift what kind of example does it set when a ceo who makes  million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers” acorda therapeuticsedit in february  loeb asked acorda therapeutics in which third point had a  stake to sell itself to a larger us pharmaceutical firm arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite fampridine sr” a multiple sclerosis drug produced by acorda through the food and drug administration fda approval process and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently” he argued that if acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a european firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible but also to your public shareholders who have supported fampridine srs development” his letter sent acorda shares up nearly  acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors

appointmentedit after third point disclosed its stake in yahoo on september   calling for the resignations of four directors yahoo set up a conference call with loeb jerry yang of yahoo and one of the directors in question roy bostock loeb said that the conversation concluded with “mr bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call” bostock however claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call” loeb informed yahoo ceo scott thompson in a march  letter that third point wanted four seats on the firms board at the time third point owned about  of the firm yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of loebs board nominees harry wilson a restructuring specialist plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides” but loeb insisted on being added himself to the board yahoo refused telling loeb according to his own account that “my experience and knowledge would not be additive to the board and that as yahoos largest outside shareholder i would be conflicted as a director  only in an illogical aliceinwonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is well a shareholder too” loeb charged that the “boards evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance” in response to yahoos charge that third point was a “shortterm investor” loeb responded that “this longterm vs shortterm excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of yahoo if there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency it is this one” loeb added that the “real issue is not shortterm versus longterm but about board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment” in a may  letter to yahoos directors loeb noted that according to yahoos filings with the us securities and exchange commission newly hired ceo scott thompson had a bachelors degree in accounting and computer science whereas a simple google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only” thompson resigned ten days later on the same day loeb wilson and another third point candidate michael j wolf were named to the yahoos board resignation from boardedit marissa mayers appointment as ceo to replace thompson was seen as the culmination of loebs efforts to transform yahoo loeb wilson and wolf submitted their resignations from yahoos board in july  and yahoo bought back  million shares from third point leaving the hedge funds ownership at less than  so the three executives had to leave however the hedge fund gained a profit of  billion marissa mayer issued a statement praising loeb “daniel loeb had the vision to see yahoo for its immense potentialwhile theres still a lot of work ahead theyve given us a great foundation” steven davidoff of new york times observed that yahoo seemed like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors daniel s loeb” noting that yahoos share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away” according to a january  vanity fair profile when loeb told mayer he wanted to sell  million shares or onethird of his remaining holdings mayer stated yahoo would buy back the stock at a guaranteed  per share—but only if he sold  million shares this transaction would bring loeb’s stake below the  percent threshold which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board loeb also signed a standstill agreement in  that bars him from activist investing in yahoo until  sothebysedit loebs announcement in august  stated that he acquired a  stake in sothebys causing its shares to rise  sothebys announced in september  that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend” a response to third points having raised its stake in the company the new york times reported that sothebys share price had “climbed about  percent since third point disclosed its increased stake” loeb disclosed on october   that he was now sothebys largest shareholder with a  stake on the same date he announced his desire to join sothebys board and called for the resignation of chairman and ceo william f ruprecht “sothebys is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration” loeb wrote in a letter to the sec charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture” as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to christies” sothebys main competitor the firm he wrote required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and ceo to be filled by two different persons not one in a later statement loeb said that “sothebys malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels” criticized ruprechts  million salary and chastised the sothebys directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet sothebys replied to loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the standard  poors midcap index over the one five and ten year periods” adam lindeman of the new york observer in an article headlined “barbarians at sothebys gate” suggested that the “firefight” between loeb and sothebys would “benefit sothebys” a place lindeman described as having “a british clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree” compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of christies ruprecht announced his resignation in november  sending sothebys shares up around  a day sonyedit loeb criticized the poor performance of sonys summer  films after earth and white house down in a letter issued that year expressing concern that sony ceo kazuo hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released ’s versions of waterworld and ishtar backtoback” loeb proposed a partial spinoff handing about  to  to existing shareholders of sonys entertainment business and even offered to backstop the initial public offering up to  billion to ensure its success “given entertainments perpetual underperformance” loeb wrote “perhaps sonys reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from understandable embarrassment” in addition to asking sony to spin off its entertainment assets loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division loebs letter sent sony stock up about  at the time third point was sony’s largest shareholder with a  stake sonys board announced on may   that it was considering loebs proposal to spin off its entertainment division “we will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on sonys response  it is an important matter that relates to sonys core businesses and management so the board must hold ample discussions” hirai said the new york times noted that japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls” hirai ultimately rejected loebs suggestion saying “sonys entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth and i am firmly committed to assuring their growth to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business” one factor in hirais decision was the counsel of advisers who argued “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded” sonys sole concession to loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment units financials” third point expressed disappointment in sonys decision but welcomed “sonys commitment to greater transparency” mgmedit the hollywood reporter reported in may  that loeb was buying up shares of mgm leading cnbc commentators to note that loeb who already owned stakes in yahoo sony and virgin media seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul bloomberg noted in september  that third point was now “one of mgm’s top five owners according to a person with knowledge of the situation” fanucedit in late  third point took a stake in fanuc a robotics and computer numerical controls firm prior fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in march  the company decided it would start talking to shareholders and return some of its cash to them loeb has met with fanucs president yoshiharu inaba with encouragement from japans government officials who are aiming to shake up companies’ slothful boards ligand pharmaceuticalsedit after ligand pharmaceuticals hired john higgins as its new ceo in january  third point management invested in the biotech firm and was able to cut its losses since  ligand pharmaceuticals tripled its stocks and doubled its revenue to  million baxter internationaledit in august  third point took a  percent stake over  billion in baxter international in a letter to baxters board loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new ceo and requested for baxter ceo robert parkinson for two seats on the board baxter reached a settlement with third point agreeing to add munib islam to its board loeb also disapproved of the boards current setup in which directors do not face

in guernsey it was listed on the london stock exchange in  “we believe that we will be the first us hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the london stock exchange” loeb said  letter about bernankeedit in a december  letter to investors loeb described a recent  minutes interview with federal reserve chairman ben s bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview” in the letter he largely rejected the narrative that bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the feds response to it bernankes “narrative arcposits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the great depression had the fed not intervened to rescue the financial system having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the fed’s intervention blindly again chairman bernanke’s next chapter states that the fed’s latest  billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment which otherwise would continue indefinitely” loeb complained rejecting bernankes “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the feds admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview” loeb called “bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking” adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong” not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision” loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing” at third point loeb wrote “we are truth seekers and problem solvers we must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for and ultimately fabricating absolute truths the only thing we are  percent confident in is that we are fallible we dont have all the answers and we will make some mistakes” fairfax lawsuitedit the canadian insurance firm fairfax financial holdings ltd sued third point and other hedge funds in a new jersey state court in march  charging that loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short fairfaxrelated positions” was the result of extensive research new jersey state court judge stephan c hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of third point llc daniel s loeb and jeffrey perry in december  dismissing the charges against them “we are gratified that the judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources” said third point describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping and a cynical attempt by fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about fairfaxs financial position”

drivers of growth and i am firmly committed to assuring their growth to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business” one factor in hirais decision was the counsel of advisers who argued “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded” sonys sole concession to loeb was an agreement “to disclose more

hedge fund urges amgen to consider a breakup by michael j de la merced october    pm october    pm photodaniel loeb founder of the hedge fund third pointcredit steve marcusreuters related links documents third point’s investor letter pdf with corporate breakups on wall street’s mind one of the biggest activist hedge fund managers around thinks the maneuver could prove helpful for the drug giant amgen third point the hedge fund run by daniel s loeb suggested on tuesday that the drug maker should consider splitting itself into two businesses a fastergrowing entity whose products require heavy amounts of research spending nicknamed growthco and a slowergrowing company with more mature products that can afford to pay out a hefty dividend known as matureco after the news shares in amgen were up nearly  percent in late afternoon trading on tuesday valuing the company at more than  billion corporate spinoffs have come into vogue in recent years as companies — some under pressure from shareholders eager for higher returns — have slimmed down their operations by shedding noncore assets corporations including ebay dupont and procter  gamble have all announced to varying degrees breakup plans that would leave them running more focused businesses spinoffs are particularly attractive because they are likely to incur far lower taxes than an outright sale of a division might in the case of amgen such an idea isn’t new mr loeb acknowledged that the idea for splitting the drug maker in two was first proposed by geoffrey porges an analyst at sanford c bernstein nevertheless such a move would make sense given that separating the two businesses could make it easier to focus on developing new drugs and attracting executive talent “a separation of amgen into matureco and growthco would likely be very well received by investors” mr loeb wrote in his firm’s latest letter to its own investors “importantly however we believe that a separation would not just be good for shareholders but that it is a more effective way of running each business” by mr loeb’s reckoning a breakup could yield significant results given its current corporate selfhelp plan amgen appears set to improve its stock’s valuation to  a share by the end of  but if the company splits itself in two the hedge fund manager contends the company’s stock could rise to almost  a share — or  percent higher than where the stock closed on monday the hedge fund manager added in his letter that he had run the ideas by amgen’s management team led by its chief executive robert a bradway and found those executives “receptive” to his suggestions in a statement amgen said that it appreciated hearing from investors including third point and that its management team continued to study ways to improve the company’s stock price executives plan to provide an update on their strategic plan on oct  while third point is trying to goad amgen into breaking itself up it has exited from another investment where it urged a corporate split mr loeb disclosed that his hedge fund has sold off its investment in sony more than a year after urging the japanese electronics giant to partially spin off its american entertainment business though sony rejected the suggestion — “regrettably” according to mr loeb — the hedge fund noted that the company made several moves that have helped lift its fortunes among them were costcutting getting out of the personal computer business and improving its television unit’s profitability the hedge fund magnate pointed to what he said was the most important result of his socalled constructivist campaign third point generated a nearly  percent return on its investment before selling out whats next loading previous post market volatility merely a symptom of larger

legalregulatory hedge funds  investment banking on wall street time to mend fences with obama by susanne craig and nicholas confessore november    pm november    pm steve marcusreutersdaniel loeb a hedge fund titan backed barack obama in  but mitt romney in  del frisco’s an expensive steakhouse with floortoceiling windows overlooking the boston harbor was a festive scene on tuesday evening the hedge fund billionaires steven a cohen paul singer and daniel loeb were among the titans of finance there dining among the gray velvet banquettes before heading several blocks away to what they hoped would be a victory party for their presidential candidate mitt romney the next morning was a cold sobering one for these executives few industries have made such a onesided bet as wall street did in opposing president obama and supporting his republican rival the top five sources of contributions to mr romney a former top private equity executive were big banks like goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase according to the center for responsive politics wealthy financiers — led by hedge fund investors — were the biggest group of givers to the main “super pac” backing mr romney providing almost  million and gave generously to outside groups in races around the country related links dealbooks election coverage on wednesday mr loeb who had supported mr obama in  was sanguine “you win some you lose some” he said in an interview “we can all disagree i have friends and we have spirited discussions sure i am not getting invited to the white house anytime soon but as citizens of the country we are all friendly” wall street however now has to come to terms with an administration it has vilified what washington does next will be critically important for the industry as regulatory agencies work to put their final stamp on financial regulations and as tax increases and spending cuts are set to take effect in the new year unless a deal to avert them is reached to not have a friend in the white house at this time is one thing but to have an enemy is quite another steve marcusreuterssteven cohen of sac capital supported mr romney “wall street is now going to have to figure out how to make this relationship work” said glenn schorr an analyst who follows the big banks for the investment bank nomura “it’s not impossible but it’s not the starting point they had hoped for” traditionally the financial industry has tended to support republican candidates but being pragmatic about power has also donated to democrats that script got a rewrite in  when many on wall street supported mr obama as an intelligent leader for a country reeling from the financial crisis goldman employees were the leading source of campaign donations for mr obama who reaped far more contributions — roughly  million — from wall street than did his opponent john mccain the love affair between wall street and mr obama soured soon after he took office and championed an overhaul in financial regulations that became the doddfrank act some financial executives complained that in meetings with the president they found him uninterested and disengaged while others on wall street never forgave mr obama for calling them “fat cats” the disillusionment with the president spawned reams of critical commentary from wall street executives “so long as our leaders tell us that we must trust them to regulate and redistribute our way back to prosperity we will not break out of this economic quagmire” mr loeb wrote in one letter to his investors the rhetoric at times became extreme like the time steven a schwarzman cofounder of the private equity firm blackstone group compared a tax proposal to “when hitler invaded poland in ” mr schwarzman later apologized for the remark mr loeb was not alone in switching allegiances in the recent presidential race hedge fund executives like leon cooperman who had supported mr obama in  were big backers of mr romney in  and wall street chieftains like jamie dimon of jpmorgan chase and lloyd c blankfein of goldman sachs who have publicly been democrats in the past kept a low profile during this election but their firms’ employees gave money to mr romney in waves starting over with the obama white house will not be easy one senior wall street lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity said wall street “made a bad mistake” in pushing so hard for mr romney “they are going to pay a price” he said “it will soften over time but there will be a price” mr obama is not without supporters on wall street prominent executives like hamilton james of blackstone and robert wolf a former top banker at ubs were in chicago on tuesday night celebrating with the president “what we learned is the people on wall street have one vote just like everyone else” mr wolf said still while the support wall street gave mr romney is undeniable mr wolf said “mr obama wants a healthy private sector and that includes wall street “if you look at fiscal reform infrastructure immigration and education they are all bipartisan issues and are more aligned than some people make it seem” reshma saujani a former hedge fund lawyer who was among mr obama’s top bundlers this year and is planning to run for city office next year agreed “most people in the financial services sector are social liberals who support gay marriage and believe in a woman’s right to choose so i think many of them will swing back to democrats in the future” she said correction november   an earlier version of this article misidentified reshma saujani as a male
