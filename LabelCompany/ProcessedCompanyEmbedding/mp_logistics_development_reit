global scale for industrial reits   by michele lerneras the global economy continues to regain its footing the industrial reits that are so vital to the flow of commerce are seeing some positive tailwinds in their favor in particular the emergence of a middle class in china and brazil and the rise of ecommerce in europe and japan are creating an environment for success for industrial reits with a global presence industrial reits are also benefitting from the demand for facilities that can meet growing demand for quick—even sameday—retail deliveries to consumers “there are advantages to being a global player” says chris caton vice president and head of research at usbased industrial reit prologis nyse pld “first our customers are global so we need to provide them with services everywhere they are we can help them grow their business too because we can do things like work with a japanese retailer in france or viceversa” global companies also can ratchet up or down development acquisition disposition and operational strategies by market instead of being tied to one locale caton says as an asset class the industrial sector is focused around distribution centers whose tenants are global such as amazon says scott crowe managing director and global portfolio manager for resource real estate “right now these industrial reits are responding to the redesigned supply chain and the need for more efficient assets and automation” he says “we came out of this recession with a different economy with technologies emerging that change where people work and how they live we haven’t had a change on the supply side for  years so the industrial sector is in the midst of addressing that” demand drivers in the industrial sector given the lack of modern facilities there is huge potential to improve the efficiency of logistics in china japan and brazil says jeffrey schwartz cofounder and chairman of the executive committee of singaporebased industrial reit global logistic properties sgx glp “the demands of domestic consumption are not being adequately met by the logistics infrastructure in china and brazil resulting in logistics costs as a percentage of gdp twice as high as developed countries” he says caton says the industrial sector is impacted most by consumers and retail performance globally there are opportunities in countries with an emerging consumer class in japan where the economy doesn’t grow as rapidly there are opportunities because of the reconfiguration of the supply chain he says “the primary demand driver in the us and on a global basis in this sector is the need for stateoftheart space for tenants” says john w guinee iii managing director with stifel nicolaus “just a decade ago everyone wanted a bigger centralized distribution center but now people want ecommerce facilities to be more automated than a typical distribution center taller and to have parking for trailers and for the people who work there they’re still centralized but now they’re centralized in areas with tight demographics so they can reach more people faster” schwartz says that domestic consumption is a key driver of demand for his company more than  percent of its portfolio caters to that segment of the market “in china continuing urbanization and rising household incomes continue to drive domestic consumption” schwartz says “in japan and brazil demand for our facilities is driven by systematic supply chain modernization as companies move towards outsourcing logistics and shift from a strategy of owning warehouses to leasing them” schwartz says space leased by ecommerce customers in china has increased at a compound annual growth rate of  percent while its share of total logisticsleased area has increased from  percent in  to  percent today transportationexpress delivery clients driven by ecommerce have also expanded rapidly within the firm’s platform up from nearly zero in  to  percent today in japan and brazil ecommercerelated customers make up  percent and  percent of global logistics’ leased area respectively he says supply constraints in the industrial sector caton says the transition to a more global economy over the past  years has changed the industrial property sector “the location of warehouses used to be driven by taxes but now there’s a demographic shift to be closer to larger numbers of consumers because of the emphasis among retailers of nextday delivery” says jon petersen vice president of equity research at mlv  co “this is not only in the us but also in europe singapore hong kong and tokyo” right now industrial reits are benefitting from a lack of supply so they’re enjoying aboveaverage rent growth and aboveaverage occupancy rates according to petersen “in asia lack of supply means there’s not much opportunity for acquisitions so everything is groundup development” petersen says “in europe there’s mostly older product with a high rate of obsolescence which gives companies an opportunity to buy up existing warehouses and redevelop them” in europe just like in the us caton says everything’s on the table in the industrial sector acquisitions redevelopment and development “europe is a different case than asia and latin america although it’s a growth market for logistics too” caton says “the european market is only about  years old in part because it wasn’t a unified market until the rise of the euro and the decline of trade barriers now that it’s emerging as one market there’s a role for us in solving supplychain issues” challenges for global industrial reits the basic challenges of working with customers who are located in different time zones and speak a variety of languages are relatively easy to overcome according to guinee yet he says industrial reits that invest overseas face other challenges too such as access to land in convenient locations near highways and ports in his experience favorable infrastructure features are the exception rather than the rule in lessdeveloped countries caton points to a handful of other potential roadblocks in international markets “there are some local challenges such as in brazil where the hilly topography means we have to level mountains to build” he says “in japan we have to build seismicresistant buildings due to the threat of natural disasters and multistory buildings because of the expensive land there” guinee also notes that industrial real estate companies face two other significant challenges legal issues and taxes “in the us we work under the rule of law for things like zoning permits and approvals” guinee says “overseas most reits need a jointventure partner or to hire exceptionally knowledgeable and senior local people also when us reits go overseas they’re subject to the tax laws of that particular country so those developments are far less attractive from a tax perspective” expectations remain high for the near term the industrial sector needs a recovering economy to thrive and that has only recently started to take hold according to caton “people are underestimating the strength of this real estate market” caton says “i think a constrained recovery is a good thing for the industrial sector rental growth should be good for the next  to  months” petersen also says he expects the industrial sector to outperform for another year or longer he says asia’s relative strength during the recession suggests that while there will still be growth there it’s likely to be at a more moderate rate in europe he anticipates a longer period of rent growth because the region is still near the beginning of the recovery for many companies in the space like global logistics growth is likely to be accompanied by more building “given the compelling opportunities we see across all of our markets we remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth and target to initiate  billion of development starts in china japan and brazil in  up  percent yearonyear” schwartz says those projects include annual increases in development expenditures in china on the order of  percent to  percent for the next three to five years categories global investing industrial recommended for

month price targets set by analysts amid the market turmoil in the past half year singaporelisted real estate investment trusts or reits have been under pressure they are now trading below their month price targets set by analysts but marketwatchers said that they’re optimistic reits have not lost their appeal among investors and they expect the reits sector to keep growing it’s been a honeymoon period since the first reit was launched in asia in  investors in the region including singapore caught on seeing these trusts as a good play on the property sector but now some investors said that reits may have had their day in the sun having sold off more than  per cent in value since last year still there are others who argue that the selling was overdone todd canter ceo lasalle investment management securities said “we think the sector traded off more than was justified and in fact today if you look at overall borrowing costs which was the main concern for the stocks trading off borrowing costs for the reits remain essentially unchanged from the beginning of ” some marketwatchers said that a combination of a correction in the reits market plus the impact of the subprime crisis in the us is unlikely to affect the performance of reits in the long run they are positive that fundamentals continue to be relatively good for most real estate companies around the world but industry watchers said they’re confident reits will continue to be attractive to investors despite the current cyclical correction in the reits market chris reilly director of property asia henderson global investors said “even though it’s seen less interest than it has in the last couple of years when the market was healthier it still has been very defensive it’s been more defensive than property stocks in the last year to date so i think obviously that still has a place within investor portfolios” their advice to investors when considering reits is to look at the quality of the management and underlying assets peter mitchell ceo asian public real estate association said “the thing we have to remember about reits is that they are a proxy for holding real estate directly and the underlying real estate markets throughout asia the fundamentals of those markets remain very strong” among the reits in singapore seen holding up well are those tied to the office property sector some industry
