airlines as the industry continues to evolve and become more complex and competitive these mounting challenges continue to center around necessary requirements to increase profits as well as analysts’ productivity added into this mix for airlines is the need to become more customercentric in their approach and in their service offerings one area of airline operations in particular that is affected

physical and digital worlds is one of the most critical tasks of modern marketing many businesses blend brickandmortar with a digital presence those businesses such as restaurants hotels travel agencies and even airlines find increasing challenges in connecting potential customers’ digital behaviors with realworld actions this blend has been dubbed “the phygital” world where both elements most coexist in order to thrive an isolated digital presence is about as damaging as an analog brickandmortar business there is enormous opportunity along the path where the online and offline converge a startup named bubbl is helping businesses navigate this path by connecting users to businesses in the real world via mobile phones given the phygital nature of many hospitality and travel businesses this technology promises to build bridges to customers across the spectrum to learn more about this appealing blend of physical and digital sabre insights posed the five questions to bubbl ceo jo eckersley for those that don’t know bubbl please explain what you do bubbl’s geolocation plugin is a piece of technology that supercharges existing mobile apps and gives app owners the ability to set up real time marketing campaigns and customer service direct to consumers in specific locations this means an app owner can instantly unlock inthemoment customer engagement tools like messaging surveys or instruction videos and has new revenue stream potential plus new ways to build increased loyalty businessesapp owners get a private cloud based dashboard so they can easily set up virtual fences and as people enter leave or hang around an area they can deliver prebuilt locationaware push notifications images offers videos audio or surveys to consumers with the business’s app on their phone a hotel might use push and pull messaging to inform guests in the hotel about last minute restaurant or beauty treatment availability and take a booking a hotel booking app can use survey functionality to gauge immediate feedback from guests as they leave the hotel a destination app eg a bath or paris tourism app can use locationtriggered video audio or and image notifications to promote tourist attractions a music event app can send locationrelevant ecommerce links to sell merchandise or run a ‘go backstage’ competition with the crowd and bars can send audio samples to increase footfall at a last minute gig of course the potential of the technology goes well beyond travel and hospitality sector and includes music and sport events retail banking education and many more the technology seems complicated what does it take to get started with this it did take many months of development on our side but we made sure we created an easytouse marketing platform that doesn’t require any coding knowledge or technical skills to get started bubbl’s complex geofencing technology is actually hidden behind just three lines of clever code and an effortless ‘dropin’ implementation process it seamlessly integrates with any cordova ios or android app within minutes what does it mean for businesses significantly reduced software development time expertise and deployment costs as even a junior developer can quickly plug bubbl into any app and the ability to run proximity marketing campaigns with no it support needed to set up the geofences as in case of many our competitors if you want to test out how easy it is to get started simply email us on infobubbltech or request a free day demo you can then start testing the technology straight away and see the magic of geofencing in the flesh your developers will be able to plug bubbl into your existing app within minutes and we’re always happy to help if you need any support with integration once this is done you can easily map out your chosen locations on the digital map by simply clicking on the map to draft a virtual fence next step is setting up campaigns for your ‘fenced’ venue with our prebuilt tools you can then add rich media content and campaign trigger times our clever technology is taking care of everything else given what you’ve learned from current hospitality customers what sorts of results can be achieved using this marketing channel bubbl gives businesses the ability to hyperfocus their campaigns by specific location and time helping them to improve their customer engagement and loyalty understand the best times to reach customers with our valuable footfall analysis or quickly react to customer feedback and improve the experience for current and future customers common outcomes include increased brand visibility stronger mobile presence better app engagement and tangible immediate responses to in the moment nudges for example with offers and surveys for apartment owners for example just triggering ‘how to’ videos on arrival for guests saves a huge amount of call out time and creates a great first impression we need to remember though that to make the most out of proximity engagement and to provide the best results brands and businesses should never overuse it and should always make sure that each campaign adds real value for their app users direct customer feedback isn’t always easy to get what are some steps that a business of smalltomedium size can take to begin connecting user feedback to specific experiences yes it’s not easy to get relevant customer feedback and this is why we developed bubbl in the first place locationbased technologies make it possible to target customers in the right moment and the right place when their responses are fresh and when a business is most able to respond if they need to a few quick questions as someone leaves a venue means the business can firstly verify the response to the survey is genuine as it wouldn’t fire if the person hadn’t been in the venue and they can gather valuable realtime feedback and net promoter scores a business can connect with customers in specifically selected locations and get their opinions as they’re experiencing the service or right when they’re leaving a venue the data is delivered to the dashboard live as it happens so you can measure the effectiveness of campaigns and quickly react to customers’ realtime feedback if anything goes wrong what about privacy what is the process for users to engage with and control the communications there are a lot of solutions out there that use insidious locationtracking and have no regard for user privacy and while most geolocation technologies turn to ip address tracking to establish user location practices that already generate concern from both customers and mobile networks our aim is to deliver a useful tool for brands and businesses but without breaching a user’s privacy and without draining battery or mobile data we believe mobile marketing doesn’t have to mean annoying adverts or intrusive sms ip address tracking locationtracking or behind the scenes customer predictive analytics and profiling bubbl doesn’t need to gather any personal data to function effectively as it has been designed to seek user consent and has consumer controls to manage proximity triggered engagement this means users can remain anonymous or can optin and they can control the number of engagements they receive whilst businesses can still gain customer insight and effective relevant engagement when communicating with their customers in particular bubbl will help apps to ensure that they don’t breach the new emerging privacy legislations such as the directive on privacy and electronic communications currently under revision european commission ec  and the general data protection regulation enforced from may  that will sweep through the mobile ad and data analytics

otas corporate travel developers  startups data  analytics retailing mobility traveler experience culture industry  public affairs research  intelligence innovation hub labs events back in  – almost  years before the launch of the first iphone – serbianamerican inventor nikola tesla envisioned that one day we would all have personal wireless devices that would enable us to send messages all over the world in  french novelist jules verne not only predicted man’s  moon landing – but also the name of the ship the number of crew onboard and the feeling of weightlessness they would experience in space in today’s hyperconnected world technology is advancing exponentially in the next  years computers are expected to be up to a million times more powerful than they are today and speculation is rife over what this might mean for us today predictions that sound as farfetched as verne and tesla’s insights once did are being widelyreferenced the world over from using ai to “reincarnate” people that have died to driverless cars filling our roads there is no shortage of theories on what our future will look like but the fate of many of these predictions depends in part on consumers’ willingness to embrace them the concept of driverless cars might seem cool but do people trust them enough to allow our roads to be full of them connecting predictions to consumer expectations as part of london tech week this year sabre conducted new research to gauge how consumers feel about various new technologies in order to help the travel industry understand how to gain its customers’ trust we asked  uk consumers whether or not they agreed with a number of widelycited futurists’ predictions about technologies like artificial intelligence driverless cars and d printing results found that the majority agreed with statements relating to d printing and driverless cars however they were less optimistic about some of the more forwardthinking statements – particularly those relating to artificial intelligence despite the apparent rejection of artificial intelligence the capabilities of this technology today suggest that “radical” predictions like the above are perhaps not that farfetched we now have ai systems that are capable of learning from vast amounts of complex unstructured data and turning it into actionable insights for example this is of course already used by companies like netflix amazon and music site pandora it’s all about a lack of trust the lack of belief in artificial intelligence forecasts could be down to an absence of trust a recent study by insidesalescom found that  of americans don’t trust ai it’s not hard to imagine why hollywood has had a longrunning obsession for dystopian ai narratives starting way back in the ‘twenties with fritz lang’s metropolis – and going on to include brilliant but disturbing classics like  space odyssey terminator and the matrix – it’s little wonder the term artificial intelligence invokes a certain “wariness” among the average consumer according to worldrenowned economist rachel botsman getting people to believe in some of the more “radical” technology predictions would involve something called a “trust leap” – when we take a risk to do something new or to do something differently from how we’ve always done it “people don’t want the entirely new they want the familiar done differently” she said at a recent sabre event a study by insidesalescom found that  of americans don’t trust artificial intelligenceshare consider how to communicate benefits of new tech what does all this mean for travel companies that are looking at new ways to serve travellers through technology how do we persuade travellers to take a leap of trust our research found that consumers are generally indifferent towards the use of new technologies by service providers however almost one in three indicated trust would diminish in their companies upon the introduction of emerging tech for any company it is important to convince consumers of the benefits of new technologies in order to win their trust for travel companies artificial intelligence is just starting to become a reality in  for example hilton uses ai in its watsonpowered connie robot various airlines use sabre’s intelligence exchange to turn customer data into contextual interactions and sabre’s labs team recently created a prototype facebook messenger bot that can answer travellers’ questions about their trips persuading consumers to trust – and therefore adopt – these technologies lies in focusing on explaining the benefits of using them such as ease convenience and intuitiveness the above images are extracts from new sabre research that was part of its london tech week event ttx london – an industry discussion on the

phones given the phygital nature of many hospitality and travel businesses this technology promises to build bridges to customers across the spectrum to learn more about this appealing blend of physical and digital sabre insights posed the five questions to bubbl ceo jo eckersley for those that don’t know bubbl please explain what you do bubbl’s geolocation plugin is a piece of technology that supercharges existing mobile apps and gives app owners the ability to set up real time marketing campaigns and customer service direct to consumers in specific locations this means an app owner can instantly unlock inthemoment customer engagement tools like messaging surveys or instruction videos and has new revenue stream potential plus new ways to build increased loyalty businessesapp owners get a private cloud based dashboard so they can easily set up virtual fences and as people enter leave or hang around an area they can deliver prebuilt locationaware push notifications images offers videos audio or surveys to consumers with the business’s app on their phone a hotel might use push and pull messaging to inform guests in the hotel about last minute restaurant or beauty treatment availability and take a booking a hotel booking app can use survey functionality to gauge immediate feedback from guests as they leave the hotel a destination app eg a bath or paris tourism app can use locationtriggered video audio or and image notifications to promote tourist attractions a music event app can send locationrelevant ecommerce links to sell merchandise or run a ‘go backstage’ competition with the crowd and bars can send audio samples to increase footfall at a last minute gig of course the potential of the technology goes well beyond travel and hospitality sector and includes music and sport events retail banking education and many more the technology seems complicated what does it take to get started with this it did take many months of development on our side but we made sure we created an easytouse marketing platform that doesn’t require any coding knowledge or technical skills to get started bubbl’s complex geofencing technology is actually hidden behind just three lines of clever code and an effortless ‘dropin’ implementation process it seamlessly integrates with any cordova ios or android app within minutes what does it mean for businesses significantly reduced software development time expertise and deployment costs as even a junior developer can quickly plug bubbl into any app and the ability to run proximity marketing campaigns with no it support needed to set up the geofences as in case of many our competitors if you want to test out how easy it is to get started simply email us on infobubbltech or request a free day demo you can then start testing the technology straight away and see the magic of geofencing in the flesh your developers will be able to plug bubbl into your existing app within minutes and we’re always happy to help if you need any support with integration once this is done you can easily map out your chosen locations on the digital map by simply clicking on the map to draft a virtual fence next step is setting up campaigns for your ‘fenced’ venue with our prebuilt tools you can then add rich media content and campaign trigger times our clever technology is taking care of everything else given what you’ve learned from current hospitality customers what sorts of results can be achieved using this marketing channel bubbl gives businesses the ability to hyperfocus their campaigns by specific location and time helping them to improve their customer engagement and loyalty understand the best times to reach customers with our valuable footfall analysis or quickly react to customer feedback and improve the experience for current and future customers common outcomes include increased brand visibility stronger mobile presence better app engagement and tangible immediate responses to in the moment nudges for example with offers and surveys for apartment owners for example just triggering ‘how to’ videos on arrival for guests saves a huge amount of call out time and creates a great first impression we need to remember though that to make the most out of proximity engagement and to provide the best results brands and businesses should never overuse it and should always make sure that each campaign adds real value for their app users direct customer feedback isn’t always easy to get what are some steps that a business of smalltomedium size can take to begin connecting user feedback to specific experiences yes it’s not easy to get relevant customer feedback and this is why we developed bubbl in the first place locationbased technologies make it possible to target customers in the right moment and the right place when their responses are fresh and when a business is most able to respond if they need to a few quick questions as someone leaves a venue means the business can firstly verify the response to the survey is genuine as it wouldn’t fire if the person hadn’t been in the venue and they can gather valuable realtime feedback and net promoter scores a business can connect with customers in specifically selected locations and get their opinions as they’re experiencing the service or right when they’re leaving a venue the data is delivered to the dashboard live as it happens so you can measure the effectiveness of campaigns and quickly react to customers’ realtime feedback if anything goes wrong what about privacy what is the process for users to engage with and control the communications there are a lot of solutions out there that use insidious locationtracking and have no regard for user privacy and while most geolocation technologies turn to ip address tracking to establish user location practices that already generate concern from both customers and mobile networks our aim is to deliver a useful tool for brands and businesses but without breaching a user’s privacy and without draining battery or mobile data we believe mobile marketing doesn’t have to mean annoying adverts or intrusive sms ip address tracking locationtracking or behind the scenes customer predictive analytics and profiling bubbl doesn’t need to gather any personal data to function effectively as it has been designed to seek user consent and has consumer controls to manage proximity triggered engagement this means users can remain anonymous or can optin and they can control the number of engagements they receive whilst businesses can still gain customer insight and effective relevant engagement when communicating with their customers in particular bubbl will help apps to ensure that they don’t breach the new emerging privacy legislations such as the directive on privacy and electronic communications currently under revision european commission ec  and the general data protection regulation enforced from may  that will sweep through the mobile ad

launch of the first iphone – serbianamerican inventor nikola tesla envisioned that one day we would all have personal wireless devices that would enable us to send messages all over the world in  french novelist jules verne not only predicted man’s  moon landing – but also the name of the ship the number of crew onboard and the feeling of weightlessness they would experience in space in today’s hyperconnected world technology is advancing exponentially in the next  years computers are expected to be up to a million times more powerful than they are today and speculation is rife over what this might mean for us today predictions that sound as farfetched as verne and tesla’s insights once did are being widelyreferenced the world over from using ai to “reincarnate” people that have died to driverless cars filling our roads there is no shortage of theories on what our future will look like but the fate of many of these predictions depends in part on consumers’ willingness to embrace them the concept of driverless cars might seem cool but do people trust them enough to allow our roads to be full of them connecting predictions to consumer expectations as part of london tech week this year sabre conducted new research to gauge how consumers feel about various new technologies in order to help the travel industry understand how to gain its customers’ trust we asked  uk consumers whether or not they agreed with a number of widelycited futurists’ predictions about technologies like artificial intelligence driverless cars and d printing results found that the majority agreed with statements relating to d printing and driverless cars however they were less optimistic about some of the more forwardthinking statements – particularly those relating to artificial intelligence despite the apparent rejection of artificial intelligence the capabilities of this technology today suggest that “radical” predictions like the above are perhaps not that farfetched we now have ai systems that are capable of learning from vast amounts of complex unstructured data and turning it into actionable insights for example this is of course already used by companies like netflix amazon and music site pandora it’s all about a lack of trust the lack of belief in artificial intelligence forecasts could be down to an absence of trust a recent study by insidesalescom found that  of americans don’t trust ai it’s not hard to imagine why hollywood has had a longrunning obsession for dystopian ai narratives starting way back in the ‘twenties with fritz lang’s metropolis – and going on to include brilliant but disturbing classics like  space odyssey terminator and the matrix – it’s little wonder the term artificial intelligence invokes a certain “wariness” among the average consumer according to worldrenowned economist rachel botsman getting people to believe in some of the more “radical” technology predictions would involve something called a “trust leap” – when we take a risk to do something new or to do something differently from how we’ve always done it “people don’t want the entirely new they want the familiar done differently” she said at a recent sabre event a study by insidesalescom found that  of americans don’t trust artificial intelligenceshare consider how to communicate benefits of new tech what does all this mean for travel companies that are looking at new ways to serve travellers through technology how do we persuade travellers to take a leap of trust our research found that consumers are generally indifferent towards the use of new technologies by service providers however almost one in three indicated trust would diminish in their companies upon the introduction of emerging tech for any company it is important to convince consumers of the benefits of new technologies in order to win their trust for travel companies artificial intelligence is just starting to become a reality in  for example hilton uses ai in its watsonpowered connie robot various airlines use sabre’s intelligence exchange to turn customer data into contextual interactions and sabre’s labs team recently created a prototype facebook messenger bot that can answer travellers’ questions about their trips persuading consumers to trust – and therefore adopt – these technologies lies in focusing on explaining the benefits of using them such as ease convenience and intuitiveness the above images are extracts from new sabre research that was part of its london tech week event ttx london – an industry discussion on the future of distribution
