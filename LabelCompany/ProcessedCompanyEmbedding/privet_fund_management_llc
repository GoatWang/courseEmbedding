failed to secure additional value for shareholders considers current offer from hytera against the best interests of all stakeholders privet funds current offer to acquire norsat at us per share remains open atlanta  june   prnewswire  privet fund management llc privet or we the largest shareholder of norsat international inc norsat tsxnii nyse mktnsat announced today that privet will be voting its approximate  common share ownership against the proposed arrangement resolution with hytera communications co ltd hytera  privet believes the norsat board of directors squandered a significant opportunity to extract additional value for all shareholders by failing to deliver a topping offer from hytera while privets bona fide fully financed offer of us was on the table we find it incredible that the norsat board believes an identical offer from hytera represents the best interests of all stakeholders in light of the mounting political scrutiny and regulatory uncertainty surrounding a transaction with hytera   said ryan levenson managing member of privet even more egregious in exchange for merely matching privets offer the norsat board gifted an additional us to hytera in the form of an increased termination fee making it even more expensive for a third party to deliver a topping bid the increased fee brings the total amount of incremental termination fees norsat has bestowed upon hytera for just keeping up with privet to us million  or us per share  that is money that could have gone directly to shareholders rather than used to ensure that hytera remains in an advantageous negotiating position added mr levenson if you liked this article you might like this horrifies me as a citizen but not as an investor a screen brings up two stocks in the
