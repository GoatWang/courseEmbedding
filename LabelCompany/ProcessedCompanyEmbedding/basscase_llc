and appreciate all of our customers some customers did not receive their instruction sheet in their packaging so in addition to the diagram image above below you will find some further instructions on how to operate basscase the switch on the back has three positions the furthest left is off the middle position is the bluetooth position to play music put the switch into the bluetooth position make sure your phones bluetooth is turned on and look for basscase on the list of bluetooth devices nearby simply click connect now when you watch a movie play music or play any audio on your phone it will come out of the basscase speakers in the future since your phone is already paired to basscase you would only need to put the switch in the middle position in order for it to automatically connect the far right position is the charging lightning bolt position this position connects the basscase to the phone electronically which allows power transfer from basscase to the phone when it is plugged in or when you need extra power on the go so if you are not plugged into the wall and want to run the power from the basscase battery to your phone battery you would simply move the switch to the lightning bolt position the basscase battery however will charge no matter what position the switch is in therefore you can charge basscase while it is playing music this will allow you to use it as a standalone speaker for endless music play the charger cord must be pushed firmly to ensure it goes all the way in to basscase or you might see it go back and forth from charging to not charging please

info made  basscase soundcloud twitter facebook brian coming from a not so fortunate upbringing music was something that played a vital role in the structure of my life music helped build my character and values growing up being apart of the metalcore scene just like the rave scene it was and still is given a bad rep from the mainstream media but to be honest they couldnt be more wrong a band like hatebreed is not be to judged by cover or namehands down this was the most influential band that impacted my life and taught me to stand up for what i believe in to never give up and to live for something or die for nothing this lead me to join the military to make something of cards that were dealt to me which ultimately lead me here but that helped build my heart but not fill it thats where dance music comes in dance music helped me fill my heart and open my mind the scene being so welcoming and open minded is something i was not use to edm drove me to want to learn how to dance the many genres of edm bring you through their own unique emotional ride where you can express yourself through many different styles of dancing my relationship with music is the definition of true love i learn how to love something so much that it showed me what love meant on a whole other level which allowed me to love the people and things in my life even more cody ummnot sure how to follow that but umm if it was legal i would marry music if i could   interview hometown memphis tn currently living san diego ca origin of name music all day everyday we listen to music all day everyday music has always been there every step of our days its a major part of our lives weapon of choice one mind any weapon source of power  brian hatebreed throwdown headhunterz trance generators zatox killswitch engage cody pink floyd both armin van buuren above  beyond andrew rayel markus schulz dash berlin cosmic gate ww showtek eminem linkin park the list can go on and on… are there any dots to connect with wherehow you grew up to your musical output honestly none we both had no musical education experience growing up once we were introduced to dance music and decided we wanted to create our own is when we started making dots to connect whats the strangest part of your job balancing our busy military careers multiple deployments and finding time to pursue a dream that requires a great amount of time and work seeing it get to this level is really mind blowing pursuit of happiness what is the biggest misconception about being a dj its not all fun and games there is a lot of hard work and long nights put into it what is your ultimate career dream to play at a state of trance are you impulsive with your work or do you have a sketch in mind before you start both some days youre on and some days you cant even make a paper plane how if at all does listening to music figure into your creative process you have to understand how to be a good follower in order to be a great leader so we believe in being good listeners to inspire us to become great producers there are a lot of unbelievably talented artists out there that you can gain a great amount of knowledge from just by listening to their music if we pressed shuffle on your ipod while you went to the bathroom what would you be embarrassed to come back to us listening to there are some tracks on our ipods that would embarrass people just for being in the room while theyre on but were not ones to get embarrassed by music we love what should everyone just shut the fuck up about stop highlight the problems in the scene and work on coming up with solutions to make it better what gets you excited when you think about the future of electronic music and club culture the fact that we get to be a part of it when you look at electronic music and the surrounding culture what worries you about the future its commercializing people are starting to forget the foundation that the scene was built upon and we need to work towards reeducating not only for safety but for the overall experience how would you describe your sound to a deaf person show them a heart tell me about your most memorable night out as an artist or as a fan when cosmic gate premiered their wake your mind album with emma hewitt at nocturnal  it was such an emotional set do you have a favorite alltime mixed cd or series backstreet
