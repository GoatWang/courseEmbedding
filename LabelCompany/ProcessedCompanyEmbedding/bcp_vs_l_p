association “njea” “plaintiffs” seek to compel disclosure of investment agreements and side letters under the open public records act “opra” and the common law right of access the defendants are john mccormac treasurer of the state of new jersey and barbara ohare manager of the government records access unit “defendants” defendants denied the request for disclosure on the grounds that  the documents contain trade secret and proprietary commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under njsa a  the documents contain information which if disclosed would give an advantage to competitors or bidders and therefore are exempt from disclosure under njsa a and  the public need for confidentiality outweighs the plaintiffs interest in disclosure under the common lawthe nine documents include agreements of limited partnership collectively the “partnership agreements” for each of the five partnerships  blackstone capital partners v lp  blackstone capital partners vs lp  oak hill capital partners ii lp  quadrangle capital partners ii lp and  warburg pincus private equity ix lp collectively the “funds” and four letter agreements collectively the “side letters” between common pension fund e the common trust fund through which the new jersey division of investment “doi” invests pension fund assets in alternative investments and the funds andor the respective general partners of the funds njsa a njac    cwa is the exclusive collective negotiations agent for approximately  public employees throughout new jersey a majority of whom are members of the public employees retirement system “pers” njea is a labor organization that represents the professional and economic interests of approximately  active and  retired employees of school districts and provides assistance and support to the majority of representatives of school employees in new jersey nearly all of its members or retirees receive pensions from the teachers pension and annuity fund “tpaf” the pers and tpaf along with three other new jersey state pension funds hold approximately  billion in pension system assets that the doi manages in various investment vehicles njac historically employees of the doi invested these monies in variable return securities and public fixedincome ie stocks and bonds however following the lead of other states investing with and benefiting from partnerships with private equity firms new jersey adopted an alternative investments program “aip” njs a a under the aip the common pension fund e was created the common pension fund e contains the commingled assets of five new jersey pension funds  the police and firemens retirement system  the pers  the state police retirement system  the tpaf and  the judicial retirement system of new jersey the aip authorizes the doi to invest a portion of the common pension fund e in alternative investment classes including private equity real assets and absolute return strategies njsa a njac    the aip authorizes doi to become a limited partner in a private equity fund for which a general partner who is not an employee of the state makes the daytoday investment decisions furthermore the federal securities and exchange commission “sec” exempts private equity funds from the disclosure requirements of the securities act of   cfr §  specifically rule  only requires private equity funds to provide identifying information the number of investors the dollar amount of securities sold the expenses of issuance and a general statement of the intended use of the proceeds this exemption promotes the policy of allowing a small number of sophisticated investors to pursue investments without revealing their strategies to the public the state through its common pension fund e is considered one such sophisticated investorcurrently the state is a limited partner of a number of partnerships with private equity firms as general partners to create each limited partnership a general partner negotiates with the state to draft a partnership agreement according to william clark the director of the doi each agreement “sets forth the name of the fund  and the name of its general partner andor investment advisor” the agreements give the purpose and duration for each fund they detail the investment strategies of the general partners and establish boundaries for what types of investments may be made and how much the general partner may invest in each they set forth how long the general partner may hold a particular investment and outline contingency plans for disruptions to the ordinary management of the fund the agreements also set forth an accounting convention how to allocate profits and losses of a fund and how to address tax issues finally they establish the fees for managing the fund and what happens in case a partner violates the terms of the agreementonce the general partner drafts the partnership agreement for a particular fund the general partner and the state must negotiate a supplemental agreement to address the peculiar needs of the state specifically the socalled “side letter agreement” gives the state a seat on the advisory board acknowledges the states status as a taxexempt entity sets out additional notice and reporting requirements establishes limitations on indemnity and liability and incorporates provisions regarding the state investment councils “sic” policy concerning political contributions and prohibitions on investment management business the side letter agreement also notes plaintiffs pending appellate litigation challenging the legality of the regulations authorizing the aip communications workers of america v mccormac docket no atin addition the partnership agreements and the side letter agreements establish the confidentiality of a particular fund allowing only three employees of the doi and its director to have access to the entirety of the agreements according to clark these confidentiality terms allow the sic now a thirteenmember body that includes two union representatives to obtain “a summary of the material terms of the states investment in each fund including the name and type of the fund the size and geographic focus of the fund a general description of the funds investment strategy the term of the fund and the investment period the amount of the states commitment and the management fee paid to the fund”on june   cwa submitted requests pursuant to opra and the common law right of access for all contracts and proposed contracts the doi or the department of treasury had with the private equity funds on june   njea submitted an identical request the requests were assigned reference numbers c and c respectively between june   and october   the parties engaged in a series of correspondence as part of these communications the defendants requested additional time to respond to the requests and requested a special service fee of  for the

aforementioned tasks defendants submitted the redacted documents and a new vaughn index on december   subsequently the court set oral argument for february   the parties filed supplemental briefs on march  the court must address two issues  whether defendants properly denied access to the partnership and side letter agreements under opra because they constitute a proprietary information which if disclosed would give an advantage to competitors and  assuming the partnership agreements and side agreements are exempt under opra whether plaintiffs are entitled to access under the common law the court will also discuss the application of the redaction language in opra as it applies to documents not considered government records and deemed confidential open public records act“opra”opra provides that “government records shall be readily accessible for inspection copying or examination by the citizens of this state with certain exceptions ․“ njsa a moreover public policy requires courts to construe narrowly opras limitations on the right to access government records ibid times of trenton publg corp v lafayette yard cmty dev corp  nj    libertarian party of cent new jersey v murphy  njsuper   appdivopra defines a government record asany paper written or printed book document drawing map plan photograph microfilm data processed or image processed document information stored or maintained electronically or by soundrecording or in a similar device or any copy thereof that has been made maintained or kept on file ․ or that has been received in the course of his or its official business․njsa aopra narrows this general definition by naming classes of records that do not qualify as government records under opra these includetrade secrets and proprietary commercial or financial information obtained from any source for the purposes of this paragraph trade secrets shall include data processing software obtained by a public body under a licensing agreement which prohibits its disclosureinformation which if disclosed would give an advantage to competitors or biddersibidwhen an agency invokes exemptions such as the ones above and denies a citizen access to requested records “the custodian shall indicate the specific basis therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor” njsa ag opra further provides that “a person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of the record at the option of the requestor may ․ institute a proceeding to challenge the custodians decision by filing an action in superior court ․” njsa a during the proceeding the records custodian bears the burden to show that opra authorizes nondisclosure of the requested records finally if defendants fail to justify denying the record the court shall order that plaintiff have access and award a reasonable attorneys fee ibida proprietary commercial or financial informationdefendants submit the disputed documents contain proprietary commercial or financial information opra provides thata government record shall not include the following information which is deemed to be confidential ․ trade secrets and proprietary commercial or financial information obtained from any source for the purposes of this paragraph trade secrets shall include data processing software obtained by a public body under a licensing agreement which prohibits its disclosure․njsa abefore addressing whether defendants properly invoked this exemption the parties have raised a preliminary question of statutory interpretation what records did the drafters of opra intend to protect under this exemption or what qualifies as proprietary commercial or financial information neither of these terms is defined in opra and there are no reported decisions in new jersey interpreting the exemptioncourts interpret words in a statute according to their plain meaning white v mattera  nj    town of morristown v womens club of morristown  nj    kimmelman v henckels  mccoy inc  nj    plain meaning has been defined as the “ordinary and wellunderstood” meanings great atl  pac tea co v borough of point pleasant  nj   as a result applying the plain meaning of the statute defendants argue “proprietary commercial and financial information from any source” is not a government record under opra even if the documents are in the possession of a public agency under opras predecessor the right to know law proprietary commercial and financial information was not exempt from disclosure in hip of new jersey inc v dept of banking and ins  njsuper  appdiv the court applied the right to know law to certain proprietary commercial and financial information and ordered disclosure to override that decision the legislature amended new jerseys freedom of information act to explicitly contain an exemption for proprietary commercial or financial informationplaintiffs argue the partnership agreements and side letters lost their proprietary status upon disclosure to the state for the purposes of negotiating and entering the agreement this argument is not persuasive if adopted the consequence would be that all government contracts would be subject to disclosure under opra even when the parties have gone to great lengths to ensure the confidentiality of the informationmost importantly defendants represent that the partnership agreements and side agreements are developed by the funds the funds do not disclose them to the general public and the documents contain proprietary commercial or financial information here defendants have provided the court with briefs affidavits vaughn indices and the subject documentsplaintiffs submit this approach is too broad and frustrates the purpose of opra inasmuch as njsa a provides that “any limitations on the right of access ․ shall be construed in favor of the publics right of access ․” plaintiffs argue the proper scope of the exemption is contained in the freedom of information act foia protecting “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential ․”  usc bgenerally federal case law tests whether a record meets exemption b according to three elements in natl parks  conservation assoc v morton  fd  dccir the court considered disclosure of records pertaining to concessions operated within national parks to determine whether these records were “a commercial or financial b obtained from a person and c privileged or confidential” id at  the parties agreed that the records met elements a and b of the exemption but contested their characterization as “ ‘confidential’ within the meaning of the exemption” ibida federal court applying the foia standard considers whether requested records are a proprietary b commercial or financial and c confidential for the purpose of the foia this threestep analysis does not apply in new jersey in new jersey by contrast the plain language of opra identifies only two of those elements a proprietary and b commercial or financial when the party denying access proves those elements the record is “deemed to be confidential for the purposes of opra” njsa a manifestly under opra confidentiality attaches as a consequence of a record being proprietary and commercial or financial in other jurisdictions confidentiality is a precondition along with proprietary and commercial or financial for nondisclosure this significant difference in terminology and phrasing signals no legislative intent to add a confidentiality requirement to opra for proprietary commercial or financial informationmoreover given the volume of case law interpreting “confidentiality” in the foia the court assumes the legislature understood the standards under the foia and the decision to omit the term “confidential” as a requirement for nondisclosure was deliberate as confidentiality is not a precondition for nondisclosure under opra for proprietary commercial or financial information the national parks test does not apply cf ayers v dauchert  njsuper   appdiv presuming that if the legislature changes longexisting judiciallyconstrued language in its own statutes it rejects those judicial constructions thus the proper application of the exemption asks whether the records are a proprietary b commercial or financial information c obtained from any sourceplaintiffs argue this test will exempt more records from disclosure than the legislature intended howeverwhen interpreting a statute our overriding goal must be to determine the legislatures intent as a general rule the look to the plain language if that language is clear he sole function of the force it according to itswhite supra  nj at opra excludes from the definition of government record all “proprietary commercial and financial information and “deems” all such information to be confidential njsa a as noted heretofore the legislature is presumed to be aware of the federal statute and it chose not to adopt the federal statutory languagein any event the federal courts exempt private commercial information from disclosure under the foia if the disclosure would impair the governments ability to obtain such information in the future or disclosure will cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained natl parks supra  fd at because experience demonstrates that private equity funds will not accept investment from government investors if their confidential information becomes subject to compelled public disclosure such disclosure will impair the ability of the state to enter investment agreements with private equity funds by diminishing the number that will accept the states business whether or not the foia is used as a guide to interpret opra the investment agreements are exempt from disclosure in new jersey and under the foia exemption  as wellthe district of columbia which created the test held that when a private party voluntarily provides commercial information the information is exempt from disclosure under  usc section b if the private party who submitted it would not ordinarily disclose it to the public see critical mass energy project v nuclear regulatory commn  fd  dccir en bancthe critical mass exception is consistent with the national parks test if the information has been provided voluntarily and if the entity has proved it would not ordinarily release the information to the public then compelled release means that the private entity will stop providing the information voluntarily this lack of cooperation will as national parks put it “impair” the ability of the government to obtain information whether or not the national parks test is read into opra the evidence in this case with respect to the industry demonstrates that the investment agreements are not subject to disclosurethe sole function of the court is to enforce a statute according to its terms the court rejects the notion by the plaintiffs that the plain language of opra created an overly broad exemption that argument in essence invites the court to judicially redraft the legislation to correct and alter the plain language of the statute redrafting legislation is a job for the legislative branch not the judiciarywhile courts have the authority to appoint an independent expert or special master to provide assistance and the court initially considered this possibility upon further review the court is satisfied that option is not warranted r  in this case the parties have filed lengthy briefs and certifications and appeared for oral argument furthermore the court has in camera reviewed the documents on this record and given the summary and expedited nature of these proceedings the court is satisfied the record contains sufficient facts and information applying the plain meaning of the terms to the appropriate legal standards to decide the case without the assistance of a thirdparty professionalthe american heritage dictionary of the english language provides the following definitions proprietary “ of relating to or suggestive of a proprietor or to proprietors as a group had proprietary rights behaved

agreements between the state and defendant intervenor blackstone kenneth c whitney blackstones senior managing director asserts the proprietary nature of blackstones investment agreements the provisions of the investment agreements embody approximately  years of experience by blackstone in the business of private equity investment blackstone has rigorously policed the confidentiality of terms governing the investment partnerships it has sponsored blackstone has spent significant time and cost developing and implementing the terms of the investment agreements․ this effort has consisted of many years of diligent work by the general partner and the principals as well as numerous legal and tax advisors and consultants declining to protect the investment agreements from disclosure would abrogate the strict confidentiality blackstone has carefully established an enforced concerning the terms of the investment agreements the investment agreements are not publicly

need to know basis and to those persons whose function within the organization requires the knowledge of that specific information in the course of their business the side letter agreements are not generally available to all limited partners of the funds only those limited partners that are given “most favored nation” status are provided with all side letter agreements the investment agreements contain express confidentiality provisions obligating each limited partner to maintain the confidentiality of the terms of the agreements and nonpublic information regarding the general partner and the partnership “except as otherwise required by law” while the partnerships certificates of limited partnership are publicly filed with the secretary of state in delaware the investment agreements

state and defendant intervenor oak hill capital partners gregg rubin general counsel of oak hill capital partners ii lp asserts the proprietary nature of the partnership and letter agreements the terms and provisions of the investment agreements which distinguish oak hill from other private equity funds were the result of considerable effort on the part of oak hill both with respect to financial expense and intellectual capital as well as intense negotiations with investors while oak hills certificate of limited partnership is filed publicly with the secretary of state in delaware the investment agreements themselves are not filed publicly with any government office or agency each partner in oak hill must execute oak hills partnership agreement which generally requires that each such partner keep confidential and not disclose any information contain in the investment agreements or any other information considered by oak hill to be of a confidential nature the information contained in the investment agreements is considered highly sensitive and is the result of significant resources expended by the general partner as well as the unique expertise of individuals employed by the general partner to preserve its value and the general partners investment in creating and negotiating the investment agreements the confidentiality of the information contained therein is carefully guarded by the general partner the information contained in the partnership agreement is made available only to partners of oak hill pursuant to terms whereby the recipients agree to maintain the information in strict confidence the information contained in the letter agreement is only made available to partners that request to review the letter agreement pursuant to the “most favored nations” provision in the partnership agreement the investment agreements are only made available to third parties in very rare circumstances and generally only to persons subject to confidentiality obligations similar in all material respects to the confidentiality provision in the partnership agreement if the investment agreements were released to the public then competitors could “freeride” on oak hills efforts by producing identical documents while expending relatively few resources if all or a portion of the investment agreements are disclosed the details of oak hill would be revealed not only to competitors but also to potential sellers and purchasers of portfolio companies such information could be used to directly harm oak hill and its partners including common pension fund e by way of example when the general partner desires to realize an investment ie sell a portfolio company of oak hill it negotiates the purchase price and terms with potential buyers the value of each partners interest in oak hill is directly linked to obtaining the highest purchase price however if the investment agreements were disclosed to the public such potential buyers would have information that would undermine the general partners bargaining position for were know that oak hill was of its term and only had a time to liquidate its knowledge would impact the the price potential buyers the portfolio companyin his certification rubin also describes how the agreements include trade investing and other commercial and financial matters the investment agreements ․ include i information on oak hills structure and investment strategy ii information relating to oak hills investment requirements and limitations iii the procedures and formulas for calculating distributions iv the detailed mechanism for allocating profits and losses between the general partner and the limited partners v the payment of fees and expenses and other key terms negotiated by oak hill vi “key person” provisions and vii the identity of the investors who have become limited partners of oak hill and the amount of their respective commitmentsonce again these statements demonstrate that the partnership and side letter agreements with oak hill capital partners are the proprietary commercial or financial information of oak hill capital partnerswith regard to the partnership and side letter agreements between the state and defendant intervenor quadrangle group peter ezersky managing principal of quadrangle group llc asserts the proprietary nature of the partnership and letter agreements quadrangle has spent countless hours developing and implementing the terms of our investment agreements․ this effort has consisted of years of diligent work by quadrangle and its principals as well as numerous legal and tax advisors and consultants quadrangle derives independent economic value both actual and potential from the fact that the confidential terms of the investment agreements are not known to the public including competing private equity funds that could obtain economic value from the disclosure of such information quadrangle consistently and rigorously polices the confidentiality of the terms governing the investment partnerships we sponsor including the fund the investment agreements are not publicly available and are delivered in confidence to common pension fund e as a limited partner the information contained in the investment agreements is provided to quadrangle employees and agents only on a “need to know” basis and to those persons whose function within the organization requires the knowledge of that specific information in the course of their business the investment agreements contain express confidentiality provisions obligating each limited partner to maintain the confidentiality of the terms of the agreements and nonpublic information regarding the general partner and the partnership “except as otherwise required by law” while the partnerships certificates of limited partnership are publicly filed with the secretary of state in delaware the investment agreements themselves are not publicly filed in circumstances where certain counterparties of the funds have a legitimate business purpose to review the investment agreements egcreditors in each such instance the counterparty is first required to agree to keep the investment agreements confidentialfurthermore in his certification ezersky establishes the manner in which the agreements describe trade investing and other commercial and financial matters the investment agreements describe the capital structure of the fund the investment parameters and limitations imposed on the general partners investment decisions the situations in which consent must be obtained from the limited partners and a variety of other private information about the internal operations and limitations of the fundviewed together these assertions from the certifications establish that the partnership and side letter agreements with quadrangle are the proprietary commercial or financial information of quadranglefinally with regard to the partnership and side letter agreements in general william clark director of the doi asserts the proprietary nature of the partnership and letter agreements the state has been required to maintain the confidentiality of information regarding the investment funds including the partnership agreements and the letter agreements to the extent permitted by law under the terms of the agreements they may not be furnished to anyone outside of the states advisors attorneys and consultants only three employees of the doi in addition to the director and deputy director have access to the executed copies of the private equity fund agreements which are kept in a locked filing cabinet the partnership agreements and letter agreements are not provided to members of the sic but instead the sic is provided with a summary of the material terms of the states investment in each fund this summary allows the sic to review the material terms of the states investment in the funds without disclosing confidential information including specific details of the funds organizational structure and its investment strategies and parametersclark also identifies how the agreements describe trade investing and other commercial and financial matters the partnership agreements contain detailed information concerning the operations of the general partners and the partnerships themselves the partnership agreements typically will contain representations concerning the investment strategies and processes followed by the general partners they ․ set forth certain guidelines and limitations on the general partners investment activities on behalf of the fund they set limits on the types of investments that may be made the amount of capital that may be invested in the aggregate or in a particular transaction and the length of time during which capital may be invested the partnership agreements often include “key person” provisions designating certain investment management professionals of the general partner as vital to the operation of the funds and providing contingencies triggered by the departure of one or more of these professionals the partnership agreements also restrict the outside activities of the general partners the partnership agreements limit the liability of the general partners and provide them with indemnification by the partnership for certain actions taken on behalf of the funds the partnership agreements grant limited partners the right to remove the general partner to reduce or extend the term of the partnership or the investment period and to participate on advisory committees that are able to review certain decisions made by the general partner the partnership agreements also provide mechanisms for limited partners to transfer their interests in the funds under certain conditions to withdraw from the funds to be excused from certain investments due to regulatory or other issues or to coinvest with the fund in certain investments the partnership agreements set forth a number of accounting and other financial matters including how assets of the fund are to be valued how profits and losses are to be allocated how committed capital is to be called by the fund how financial information is to be reported to the limited partners and how various tax issues are to be addressed the partnership agreements set forth the amount of management fees and how they are to be paid and set forth in detail how and when the general partners and limited partners are to receive distributions of proceeds received form investments the partnership agreements contain default provisions for violations of the terms of the agreements and mechanisms for resolving disputes arising from the agreements the letter agreements include provisions with respect to the states right to a seat on the advisory board of the fund provisions acknowledging the states status as a taxexempt entity and additional notice or reporting requirements the letter agreements deal with certain legal restrictions applicable to the state including limitations on indemnification and limitations on the contractual liability of the state due to its status as a sovereign entityagainst this backdrop the cumulative representations set forth above coupled with the in camera review establish that the partnership and side letter agreements in general are the proprietary commercial or financial information of each of the defendant intervenors therefore defendants have provided to the court substantial information to establish why these documents are  owned and considered private and  relate to business or the management of investments from the foregoing it is also apparent that the agreements meet the three factors identified by the court in lamorte burns  co supra  nj at the court agrees with defendants that the records in their entirety are proprietary commercial and financial recordsb trade secretsclearly defendants have established the documents are exempt as proprietary commercial or financial information therefore resolution of whether the documents are trade secrets is not required however for completeness the court will address whether the government has shown that any information improperly denied as proprietary commercial and financial information was properly denied as trade secrets njsa adefendants argue the court should apply the trade secrets test set forth in hammock v hoffmanlaroche inc  nj    while hammock addressed the right of public access to judicial records and materials filed with the court in civil litigation the court delineated the test for determining trade secrets as noted in hammock a trade secret consists of “any formula pattern device or compilation of information which is used in ones business and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it” restatement of torts §  comment b  or “any information that can be used in the operation of a business or other enterprise and that is sufficiently valuable and secret to afford a potential economic advantage over others” restatement third unfair competition §  tentative draft no   hammock supra  nj at  platinum management inc v dahms  njsuper   appdiv trump castle assoc v tallone  njsuper   appdiv a trade secret can consist of “aspects of business operations such as pricing and marketing techniques” trump castle assoc supra  njsuper at in evaluating whether confidential business information is recognized as a trade secret a court must consider six factors the extent to which the information is known outside of the owners business  the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in the owners business  the extent of measures taken by the owner to guard the secrecy of the information  the value of the information to the owner and to his competitors  the amount of effort or money expended by the owner in developing the information and  the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by othersrestatement of torts §  comment b  quoted in hammock supra at plaintiffs argue the hammock test is overly broad and if applied would frustrate the legislative policy in opra to construe the limitations on disclosure narrowly instead plaintiffs propose the application of the test formulated in public citizen health research group v fda  fd  dccir in that case the court held for the purposes of foia a trade secret is “a secret commercially viable plan formula process or device that is used for the making preparing compounding or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort” id at  plaintiffs submit this definition of trade secret is more limited that the test in hammockthe court agrees with defendants the court is required to apply the definition of trade secrets in new jersey that has consistently been used in the past the phrase “trade secret” is one of art and “technical words and phrases and words and phrases having a special or accepted meaning in the law shall be construed in accordance with such technical or special and accepted meaning” njsa  when the legislature uses terms with a technical or special meaning it is presumed that it intends to use the meaning the courts have applied in the past see johnson v scaccetti  nj    brewer v porch  nj    “there is an assumption that the legislature is thoroughly conversant with its own legislation and the judicial construction of its statutes” see also in re lead paint litig  nj   finding the legislature used “public nuisance” in its “strict historical sense” trinity church v lawson bell  njsuper   app divfinding “substantial completion” in statute of repose used in the sense understood in the construction industry zorba contractors inc v housing auth city of newark  njsuper   appdivfinding “legal relief” used in technical sense to imply right to jury trialtherefore whether the partnership agreements and letter exemption depends on the extent to which those records fall within the factors enumerated in hammockconcerning the first factor the extent to which the information is known outside of the owners business defendants assert the agreements are not publicly disclosed to support this defendants represent  only the general partner the limited partners prospective partners and others with a need to know have access to the agreements  parties provided access must sign a confidentiality agreement  the agreements are not filed publicly with the secretary of state in delaware or an other government office or agency and  the agreements are not subject to the secs disclosure laws as to the side letters these are disclosed to no one other than the general partner of the fund and a very limited number of doi employees furthermore the side letters are only available to the specific investor who is a party to the side letter and to a limited number of other partners who have negotiated access to such documentsthe second factor the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in the owners business defendants argue the employees agents and attorneys of each funds general partner only know the terms of the agreements on a need to know basis and then only subject to a confidentiality agreement moreover as for the state only three employees in addition to the director and the deputy director of the doi have access to the partnership agreements and side agreements which are kept in a locked filing cabinetwith respect to the third factor the measures taken to safeguard the secrecy of the purported trade secret defendants note the agreements are not filed with the attorney general the state of delaware or any other public entity furthermore the funds limit their pool of partners to specific classes of investors so that the funds agreements are not subject to disclosure under federal securities laws in addition all parties to the agreements are required to enter into confidentiality agreements finally doi maintains these agreements in a locked filing cabinetthe fourth factor addresses the value of the information to the owner and to his competitors to support the value of the agreements to their owners and to competitors defendants argue  each agreement outlines the organizational structures and investment strategies of a particular fund  if released a competitor could use this information to undermine an investment strategy and  if the terms were disclosed there would be a number of freeriding fund managers that would adopt the once confidential strategythe fifth factor relates to the amount of effort or money expended by the owner in developing the information defendants assert the parties have expended significant resources to craft the terms and conditions of the agreements this includes  the expertise required from multiple parties the general partner attorneys tax specialists and other consultants to create the agreements and  the considerable time spent to negotiate the terms and finalize the agreementsfinally defendants assert the information contained in the agreements is not easily acquired or duplicated by others inasmuch as the parties to the agreements are required to execute confidentiality agreements to hold the terms and conditions in strict confidence moreover defendants argue given the amount of time and expertise required to produce these highly complex and specialized documents the agreements are not the type of document that is easily duplicatedplaintiffs argue defendants have not identified with the required degree of specificity what parts of the agreements constitute trade secrets as a result plaintiffs seek the release of portions of the agreements that do not meet the trade secret exemptionhowever given the paper record which includes certifications of the director of the doi and managers of the private equity funds coupled with the courts review of the documents the court is satisfied that the documents meet the sixpart testc competitive advantagethe final issue under opra is whether defendants can withhold under the competitive advantage exemption any information in the records illegitimately denied under either the proprietary commercial or financial information exemption or trade secrets exemption opra deems confidential “information which if disclosed would give an advantage to competitors or bidders” njsa a the parties have not raised an issue of statutory interpretation with regard to this exemption and presumably seek its application according to its plain meaningdefendants allege that based on terms embedded within the agreements their disclosure would give a threefold advantage to competitors  it would permit other private equity funds to free ride on the effort monies and experience of the private equity funds in developing the terms of an agreement  it would allow investors competing with the private equity funds to purchase desirable investments to know the extent of the private equity funds resources and the limits of their investment strategy and  it would reveal the bargain the private equity firms offer to their investors and undermine efforts to attract new investorsin response plaintiffs challenge the explanations under opra as too vague for a lawful application of the competitive advantage exemption they compare the present situation to lykes bros steamship v pena ddc sept   and trifid corp v national imagery and mapping agency  fsuppd  edmo where the party arguing for nondisclosure failed to satisfy part two of the national parks test that disclosure would “would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained” national parks supra  fd at  it was held in those cases that the justifications for nondisclosure were vague and conclusory and did not show “substantial harm”the reasons offered for withholding documents must be specific indeed “courts will ‘simply no longer accept conclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions but will require a relatively detailed analysis in manageable segments’ “ loigman v kimmelman  nj    quoting vaughn v rosen  fd    however the court is satisfied that the claims of confidentiality are sufficient under the competitive advantage exemption to support nondisclosurethe partnership agreements and the side letter agreements differ significantly from one another each is a unique blend of variables the amount of debt each fund may carry what fees the general partner takes from a funds profits the limits on the general partners powers how a withdrawing partner redeems their investment how the fund distributes gains and various other matters these blends are the product of years of experience and disclosure of the agreements would give a real not speculative advantage to competitors who could simply piggyback on the experience of the private equity firmsmoreover the agreements detail a funds limitations on buying and selling investments any competitor knowing when a funds strategy would induce it to buy or sell would enjoy an advantage over the fund defendants point to a situation where by reviewing a funds partnership agreement a competitor could learn when a fund would be liquidating an investment as the time for liquidation neared a competitor could gain an advantage by offering an artificially low price also defendants explain how disclosure of the agreements would reveal the bargains that each fund strikes with their investors competitors who become aware of these bargains through disclosure of the agreements have the information necessary to undercut the bargain that a private equity fund offers to an investor pulling away investors from a fund in this manner would advantage a competitorimportantly many of the organizational structures developed by the funds in order to achieve success in the highly competitive field of private equity investing are embedded in the partnership agreements drafted developed and negotiated by the fundsd in camera review and redactionfirst the court has examined the documents in camera to verify and authenticate representations made by counsel in briefs filed with the court and representations in certifications submitted by william clark doi and senior managers of the private equity funds second having undertaken this laborious review the court is satisfied when a document falls within one of the statutory exemptions redaction is not requirednjsa a addresses redaction in the context of a document that has been identified as a government record and therefore subject to disclosure section a provides that prior to allowing access to any government record the custodian shall redact from that record any information which discloses the social security number and other personal identifying information furthermore section g provides if the custodian of a government record asserts that a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant to pl c  ca et seq as amended and supplemented the custodian shall delete or excise from a copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is exempt from public access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the recordnjsa  a gas noted heretofore opra defines a government record asany paper written or printed book document drawing map plan photograph microfilm data processed or image processed document information stored or maintained electronically or by soundrecording or in a similar device or any copy thereof that has been made maintained or kept on file ․ or that has been received in the course of his or its official business․njsa aimportantly the last sentence of the paragraph that defines “government record” provides “the terms shall not include interagency or intraagency advisory consultative or deliberative material” ibid applied to documents considered government records the court has an obligation to review documents in camera and when appropriate redact interagency or intraagency advisory consultative or deliberative material in re the liquidation of integrity ins co  nj   significantly this redaction methodology applies to documents already determined to be government records and not to documents considered government records and “deemed to be confidential” njsa a common law right of accessthe common law right of access to public records requires the court to balance the public interest in nondisclosure against the private interest in securing access to the information keddie v rutgers state univ  nj    home news inc v dept of health  nj    to secure access three requirements must be met “ the records must be common law public documents  the person seeking access must establish an interest in the subject matter of the material and  the citizens right to access must be balanced against the states interest in preventing disclosure” no jersey media group inc v new jersey dept of personnel  njsuper   law divquoting keddie supra  nj at it is undisputed that plaintiffs have standing and that the records are common law records clearly the agreements are filed with the state and have been created pursuant to the states alternative investment policy the issue then is whether that interest which confers standing outweighs the publics interest in keeping the agreements confidential where a public agency asserts a claim of confidentialitya court must balance the plaintiffs interest in the information against the public interest in confidentiality of the documents including a consideration of whether the demand for inspection is premised upon a purpose that tends to advance or further a wholesome public interest or a legitimate private interest where reasons for maintaining a high degree of confidentiality in the public records are present even when the citizen asserts a public interest in the information more than the citizens status and good faith are necessary to call for production of the documentsconversely ․ as the considerations justifying confidentiality become less relevant a party asserting a need for the materials will have a lesser burden in showing justification if the reasons for maintaining confidentiality do not apply at all in a given situation or apply only to an insignificant degree the party seeking disclosure should not be required to demonstrate a compelling needs new jersey newspapers v twp of mt laurel  nj   quotations and citations omittedthe court may consider a nonexhaustive set of factors when balancing interests in confidentiality versus disclosure which include the extent to which disclosure will impede agency functions by discouraging citizens from providing information to the government  the effect disclosure may have upon persons who have given such information and whether they did so in reliance that their identities would not be disclosed  the extent to which agency selfevaluation program improvement or other decisionmaking will be chilled by disclosure  the degree to which the information sought includes factual data as opposed to evaluative reports of policymakers  whether any findings of public misconduct have been insufficiently corrected by remedial measures instituted by the investigative agency and  whether any agency disciplinary or investigatory proceedings have arisen that may circumscribe the individuals asserted need for the materialsloigman v kimmelman supra  nj at defendants argue there is a significant public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the agreements first if disclosed the state represents based on industry practice and experience the state will lose private equity firms as investing partners consequently the public will lose its opportunity to invest in alternative investments which have been known to improve the anticipated rate of return relative to market risk the public interest in the aip has been reiterated and confirmed by the enactment of l c  section  which expressly allows the investment of funds by the sic into externally managed investmentssecond disclosure of the partnership and sideletter agreements will compromise the publics bargaining power when negotiating future alternative investment agreements with prospective partners the doi has a fiduciary duty to seek the best bargain for investors in the pension plan njsa a if the agreements were disclosed a prospective partner of the state in the alternative investment program would know the contours of previous bargains and refuse to agree to anything less favorable to it and more favorable to investors clearly that would harm the states fiduciary interestplaintiffs characterize their interest as a desire to secure a better understanding of how the state is investing employees pensions under the alternative investment program finally plaintiffs argue  without oversight the union is unable meet its obligation to its members  the public will lose confidence in the pension system and  defendants claims are too speculative to be attributed any weight in the common law balancing of intereststhe court concludes the balance of interests weighs in favor of defendants first the court rejects the notion that the allegations of harm articulated by defendants are simply too vague and without merit defendants arguments and certifications contain detailed concrete and plausible explanations of the adverse consequences likely resulting from access to the agreements under the common lawsecond plaintiffs position that access to the agreements is necessary to satisfy their interest in understanding investment strategies is undermined by the fact that that interest is largely satisfied by information already accessible by law njsa aa grants one seat on the sic to plaintiff njea and one seat to plaintiff cwa in turn njsa a grants the sic substantial oversight of the investments according to the certification of william clark director of doi the sic has access to a summary of the material terms of the states investment in each fund including the name and type of the fund the size and geographic focus of the fund a general description of the funds investment strategy the term of the fund and the investment period the amount of the states commitment and the management fee paid to the fund thus plaintiffs already have access to material terms of the states investment in the funds including specific details of the funds organizational structure and its investment strategies and parametersimportantly the representatives of cwa and njea on the sic will have the same access as the other members they will not only be able to “understand how the state is managing the pension plan” on behalf of their members they will be part of that management therefore the issue of transparency has been resolved by statute not only does njsa § a provide the unions a direct voice in management of the systems investments it also  provides what reports the sic is to make public  requires external investment managers to report in detail on any political contributions  requires an annual public hearing at which time members of the public may comment on the sics investment activities njsa ab through d  that is the compromise that allows the aip to go forward unimpeded while giving representatives of the states employees a direct voice in the oversight of the programmoreover the aip program safeguards against conflicts of interest to enhance transparency and bolster public confidence first njsa ab provides that “no member of the state investment council shall hold any office position or employment in any political party nor shall any such member benefit directly or indirectly from any transaction made by the director of the division of investment provided for herein” second njsa  ad provides that “an external manager shall be required to file a certification before being retained and annually thereafter that discloses the political contributions made during the  months preceding the certification by the manager or the managers firm or a political committee in which the manager or firm was active” these two provisions help ensure that investments benefit the interests of investors and not the interests of the pension funds managersplaintiffs position that access to the agreements is necessary to protect the interest of their union members and employees is further undermined by other statutorily guaranteed safeguards first njsa ab requires the sic to report at least once a year “to the governor the legislature and the state treasurer with respect to its work and the work of the division of investment” second subsection c of the same section provides thatthe council shall hold a meeting each year that shall be open to the public and shall accept comments from the public at such meeting the matters that shall be open to discussion and public comment during this annual meeting shall include the investment policies and strategies of the council the investment activities of the council the financial disclosure statements filed by council members and the certification of contributions filed by external managers as well as other appropriate matters concerning the operations activities and reports of the councilthese provisions further enhance the publics confidence in and the transparency of the alternative investment program altogether the above provisions represent the balance the legislature has established between plaintiffs interest in oversight of the program and defendants interest in keeping certain sensitive information confidential the court hesitates to upset this balance through judicial fiatmoreover plaintiffs as members of the sic already are privy to information they claim to need to better understand the states alternative investments as director clark has certifiedthe partnership agreements and letter agreements are not in the ordinary course provided to members of the sic at its meetings but instead members of the council are provided with copies of the report of the investment policy committee pursuant to njsa a however the sic is entitled to review all files and records of the division including the agreements at issue in this case it is the policy of the doi to permit any member of the council to review any record of the division including the partnership agreements and side letters provided that he or she has signed an acknowledgement agreeing to keep such record confidentialclearly plaintiffs substantial access to the files of the doi including the partnership agreements satisfies their interest to gain information regarding the aippast experience in other states demonstrates that judicial interference with this balance can seriously compromise an alternative investment program the state of california holds one of the largest public pension funds in the united states with reported assets for  exceeding  billion desiring to increase the rate of return on those assets californias legislature authorized a program similar to new jerseys aip after implementing the program the state received and denied requests from the coalition of the university employees and the california first amendment coalition for disclosure of the partnership agreements that created californias alternative investments the two parties filed separate complaints based on californias freedom of information law the plaintiffs won their case and the court ordered the disclosure of the agreements see the regents of the university of california alternative investments as of september   http wwwucopedutreasurerinvinfopeirrpdf last visited dec   “on july   the alameda county superior court ruled in the coalition of university employees et al v the regents of the university of california ․ ordering the regents to disclose fundlevel internal rates of return under the california public records act ․ including available” see also ann grimes calpers is sued to disclose fees it pays to firms wall st j sept   marc lifsher calpers discloses private equity fees to settle a watchdog suit the fund agrees to reveal what it pays to have its money managed los angeles times december  subsequently the most desirable highperforming alternative investment funds refused to take on the state as a limited partner despite the benefit of taking on a partner with over  billion of assets the funds directors preferred to maintain the confidentiality of their investment agreements to remedy the consequences of the courts decision in favor of disclosure californias legislature amended the cpra to lure back the highperforming funds as partners the amendments strike a delicate balance between a requesting partys interest in disclosure and the publics interest in keeping aspects of an alternative investment confidential under the changes the name address and vintage year of each alternative investment fund how many public dollars are committed to an alternative investment fund over its lifespan the total public dollars committed to all alternative investment funds the yearly amount of cash distributions that the public pension fund receives from any alternative investment fund the yeartoyear amount of assets that the public fund has committed in a given alternative investment fund certain measures of a funds performance the amount that the public fund pays in fees to the managers of the alternate investment fund and the amount of profit the public california public records act “cpra”  cal als  see also cal govcode §  as amended in  sb  effective january  due diligence material financial statements of the alternative investment fund materials from meetings regarding the alternative investment fund portfolio positions in which the alternative funds invest capital call and distribution notices and significantly alternative investment agreements and all related documents remain confidential  cal als  § californias experience supports defendants position that courtordered disclosure of the agreements would likely compromise the states ability to take advantage of these lucrative investment vehicles moreover experience in other states further bolsters defendants position for example in texas and michigan the legislatures amended the statutes regarding pension funds for the respective state universities to classify as confidential information regarding the funds portfolio and performance which had previously been ordered disclosed to the public see eg  mi als  §  as amended in   mi hb  new jersey need not repeat these mistakes through courtordered disclosures of the requested recordsin conclusion a balancing of the competing interests shows the public interest in confidentiality weighing more heavily especially in light of other states experiences with courtordered disclosure and plaintiffs do not have a common law right of access to the partnership or side letter agreementsan in camera review by this court of all of the agreements establishes that the terms of the agreements are complex and the practice in the industry is to maintain these as confidential and to not accept investments from entities that will not agree to do so or cannot honor such agreements moreover each agreement contains investment strategies investment parameters for fee structures and partners rights that may differ markedly from fund to fundsignificantly the legislature has recognized that the interest of plaintiffs and their interests are met without public disclosure of the agreementsiii conclusionfor the reasons set forth in this opinion the complaint is dismissed as it relates to the nine documents none of the parties addressed the imposition of a special fee in the briefs filed with the court or during oral argument therefore this court lacks sufficient information to decide this issueaccordingly the court will leave the record open for two weeks to provide the parties the opportunity to address the special fee issue absent any further filings with the court the case will be dismissed in its entiretyfootnotes  the sic is charged by statute with oversight responsibility over the investments pursued by the doi  the original request contained twentyone  separately numbered paragraphs requesting more than “all contracts or proposed contracts” issued by the state however because this  opinion deals with the alleged confidentiality of only nine of the identified documents the other requests have been omitted  the state later estimated the special service fee to range between  and   because the terms and conditions of the side letter for blackstone capital partners vlp apply to bcp vs lp there are only four letter agreements for the five funds  defendants and defendant intervenors shall be
