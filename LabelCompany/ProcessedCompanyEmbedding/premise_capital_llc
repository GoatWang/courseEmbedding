about the premise capital portfolios and investment strategies if you have further questions feel free to contact us directly at infopremisecapitalcom what is the premise capital® investment strategy our strategy is called frontier based tactical™ a blend of traditional asset allocation with tactical management we start with a diversified portfolio and use various quantitative techniques to over and underweight asset classes relative to each other this is combined with risk onrisk off adjustments that attempt to move the portfolio within a predetermined range when risk is not being compensated in the markets these dual screen tactical shifts control exposure to each class and also control the overall risk being taken by the investor how is premise capital® different from traditional asset management firms many traditional asset management and advisory firms often follow a buyandhold approach to investing and adjust the asset allocation infrequently often based on time rather than need they also tend to avoid deviating too far from longterm estimates based on current market conditions this passive approach rides the market wave up and down and can lead to investment decisions driven by emotion not data or math our difference is that we use proprietary mathematical algorithms and asset allocation models that attempt to ride upward market trends in a relatively passive manner when it makes sense to do so we use active tactical strategies when our models indicate that conditions are not favorable for taking risk this approach blends the best attributes of both investment approaches how is premise capital® different from purely tactical strategies most tactical strategies are not focused on maintaining a diversified asset allocation and as a result invest in a way that pulls your asset allocation off the efficient frontier managers make calls that concentrate the portfolio into a small number of asset classes and can significantly increase the amount of risk to the investor if a manager moves a portfolio into one or two classes the manager may make the right call and not lose during a specific period but this is not a good way to assess the true risk of the strategy you and your advisor need to look at the risks of the potential portfolio that you could own based on the decision making process of the manager current tactical style is very reliant on the next call being correct that type of management is fine as a trading strategy but should not be used as an overlay when constructing a portfolio why does premise capital® use etfs and mutual funds rather than individual stocks or bonds our choice of etfs and funds is based on our belief that it is more important to manage the exposure to the class than choose an active manager within the class we are trying to get exposure to each class as efficiently as possible and add value by adjusting the amount that is allocated to that class etfs are a great tool for that purpose but not all classes are represented well with that vehicle so there are times when mutual funds still provide the best option what prompted the founding of premise capital® premise capital was founded by its senior portfolio manager jason rolence and a team of financial advisors frustrated by a marketplace which forced them to use buy and hold asset managers unconstrained tactical managers or a disjointed combination of the two through the coresatellite industry model with more than  years of combined experience the founders strongly believed that there should be an option for investors and their advisors to package the best elements of each approach into a single seamlessly managed portfolio how often does premise capital® make trades we make trades on an asneeded basis whenever our proprietary algorithms and asset allocation models identify trend changes this approach means a trade could happen any day but by no means do we trade every day historically we have made far fewer trades than many other tactical asset management firms because we differentiate trends on the basis of their importance to investors not traders investors who have used other tactical managers may even find us boring are the premise capital® frontier advantage™ portfolios daily liquid yes because we only use publicly traded vehicles our portfolios are very liquid obviously it takes some time to make trades so it may be a day or two before an account is completely divested the time period is usually dependent on the platform or method you are using to access our models we do encourage you to have a longer time horizon to invest in our portfolios as benefits are seen over full market cycles can an investor lose money in premise capital® frontier advantage™ portfolios yes as with any investment you can lose money when we talk about downside protection it is the attempt to create a structure that doesnt just remain static in down trends can i open a personal account directly with premise capital® unfortunately no we work through your financial advisor who can determine the appropriate risk tolerance and portfolio for you as well as discuss fees and expenses if you dont have an advisor we have a network of advisors that can assist you with opening an account if your advisor doesnt have access to premise capital have them contact us are the premise capital® frontier advantage™ portfolios transparent and easy to track while portfolio trades and holdings arent disseminated directly if you are an investor your advisor will have access to the holdings every day and in most cases will be aware of transactions as they occur our core portfolios use publicly traded etfs and mutual funds that can be tracked on every major financial website using their ticker symbols does premise capital® use any leverage in its frontier advantage portfolios no our core portfolios do not use any type of leverage the etf choices are made for class exposure not for placing market bets we do not use leveraged or short etfs in our core portfolios can i invest ira or other types of qualified accounts as well as aftertax dollars yes both types of accounts are excellent options for our funds and we have specific portfolios designed for the tax attributes of each office information premise capital  east th avenue suite  naperville il  map location p  f  office hours monfri ampm
