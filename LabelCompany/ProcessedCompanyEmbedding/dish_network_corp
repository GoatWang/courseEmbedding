company that employs thousands and serves millions throughout the nation – a seemingly unlikely future on that blustery day liftoff fast forward to  when ergen set his sights on launching his first satellite from china then a novice in the satellite industry staking the future of young dish on one multimillion dollar satellite ergen gambled with the odds of a favorable launch after watching a

broadcasting named after news corps bskyb service in britain the two companies had nearly merged which called for dish network being renamed sky before it was called off due to charlie ergens clashes with news corp executives with this purchase echostar obtained  of the  transponder licenses in the ° west orbital slot more than doubling existing continental united states broadcasting capacity at a value of  million some of the other assets were picked up by rival primestar which was sold to directv in  the acquisition which also included an uplink center in gilbert arizona inspired the company

satellite dishesedit dish network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by sanminasci corporation to echostar specifications prior to the december  merger of sci systems and sanmina dish network receivers were produced at factories in huntsville alabama and fountain colorado currentlywhen receiver assembly takes place in guadalajara mexico and india dish hd newest version used with the hopper and joey system earlier satellite dishesedit dish networks first satellite antenna was simply called the dish network dish it was retroactively named the dish  when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming dish  systems it uses one lnb to obtain signals from the °w orbital location and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional highdefinition or ethnic programming from either the °w or °w orbital locations the °w slot is one of two primary orbital locations the other being °w that provide core services after echostar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between askyb and mci worldcom it had more than doubled its capacity by adding  transponders at the °w orbital location since echostar also owned the adjacent °w orbital location it developed the dish  to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative duallnb assembly although the new inch dish  was slightly larger than the thencurrent inch dish  and directv dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from echostars two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical channel capacity the dish  as a result provided very large capacity for localintolocal service nationwide programming and business services in order to migrate existing customers to dish  dish network provides valueadded channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the dish  and newer systems some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are h boomerang science planet green pbs kids sprout and comedy central higher capacity satellite dishesedit dish  with turbohd branding mounted on a residential apartment railing in spite of all this capacity echostar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide highdefinition television and conceived the dish  system to receive signals from °w °w and °w orbital locations originally dish network highdefinition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes currently dish network subscribers can receive nationwide hdtv channels using the °w orbital location or °w orbital location because of issues with low signal strength the older model dish  has been replaced with the dish  the  has a  larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated lnb for easier installation the dish  is  in  mm in diameter even with the larger size there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the °w orbital location this has forced some customers to either use a nd separate dish network brand dish or an aftermarket  dish aimed specifically at the °w orbital location on several satellite related web support forums customers have critically suggested that the new dish  wasnt nearly large enough and should have been – larger to properly deal with rain fade later dish network took the approach of splitting the us into two regions subscribers west of chicago use dish  antennas aimed at the °w °w and °w orbital locations referred to as the western arc subscribers east of chicago use

criticisms and controversiesedit main article criticism of dish network since the early s dish network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers most notably when the hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without commercials major networks sued dish network autohopedit dish networks hopper digital video recorder announced in january  led to controversy over a feature called autohop which allows viewers to watch some programming without commercials subject to time restrictions autohop is an extension of the dvrs prime time recording capability when enabled the feature records but hides commercials giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercialfree commercials cannot be skipped until  am eastern time and the viewer must choose to do this recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired news of autohop met with an immediate polarized response the feature was deemed a dream come true for consumers but for networks a nightmare undercutting the revenue model dish asserted that autohop would encourage its customers to sample new programming leslie moonves cbs chief executive asked rhetorically how he is to produce csi without the revenue stream of commercials news corporation refused to accept dish advertising for the device a forrester research analyst said the move demonstrated dishs desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the internet the controversy surrounding autohop contributed to one smallmarket station group hoak media corporation removing its  stations channels from the service on june   in negotiations hoak sought a  percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the autohop feature david shull dish senior vice president of programming accused hoak of effectively telling dishs customers that they must watch commercials disrespecting customer control over its services eight days later the two companies announced a distribution deal terms were not disclosed on june   dish chairman charlie ergen told the united states house subcommittee on communications and technology that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and fast food advertising the next day michael petricone of the consumer electronics association spoke to the subcommittee likening hopper to earlier time shifting devices he argued that hopper is legal and that autohop entices people to watch more television thereby expanding televisions market cnet was also forced by parent company cbs to disqualify the newest hopper with sling model from the ces best in show award for  because of its active litigation with the company ceo joe clayton said that dish was saddened that cnets staff is being denied its editorial independence because of cbs heavy handed tactics dish network directly attacked cbs for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website the ad proclaimed the dvr as being cnets best in show but with a footnote stating that cbs will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying adskipping technology—even censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name hopper best in show your vote is the only one that really matters work environmentedit one news report described dish as having an ergencreated culture of condescension and distrust in  the investment analysis and commentary site  wall st named dish network  among americas worst companies to work for an assessment based upon employee reviews at the employment website glassdoorcom such reviews should be interpreted with caution however as reviews at such sites sample few employees compared to the company as a whole and are weighted towards exemployees with keenlyfelt grievances current and ambivalent exemployees are less likely to post reviews it should be noted that every company is subject to the same caveats and dish was still found to be the worst long hours little vacation time and too much mandatory overtime were all common complaints dishs toxic corporate culture was cited as a key difficulty in its aborted acquisition of sprint nextel david hekman a business professor at the university of colorado said this will be a huge issue for the sprint employees if theyre subjected to this meaner culture it could be a real wakeup call hekman also stated if he gets revolt from the sprint employees  then there will be no synergy and then the merger would be viewed as a failure dish was aware of the problem after announcing its attempted merger with sprint it took out a fullpage ad in the kansas city star declaring its commitment to building a company that can deliver sustained growth over many years the ad also said we look forward to the opportunity to work together with sprints board and its management team to develop a combined vision remaining mindful of how it will benefit customers employees shareholders and of course the kansas city community as things move forward we will stay in touch dish has very rapid employee turnover the company does not report exactly how many people it fires each quarter dish refers to its quarterly culling of employees as talent upgrades michael neuman a former president of dish quit after only eight months he said that ergen acts unilaterally and pounds people in submission no president of dish has remained in the job for more than four years and many left after only one year for years dish employees were required to clock in at the beginning of their day using fingerprint scanners this measure angered many employees the fingerprint scanners were eventually removed badges were previously used to monitor the arrival and departure of employees the company started using fingerprints after charles ergen noticed some employees helping each other swipe their badges for them if an employee is late an email is sent to human resources human resources will in turn contact the employees manager possibly even charlie ergen himself multiple former employees said it was common for ergen to scream publicly at executives for arriving even minutes late dish does not allow its employees to work from home for several years dish policy required that any tip over  percent given on an expensed meal would be subtracted from the paycheck of the responsible employee dish does not provide employees with company credit cards telemarketing violationsedit dish network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered dish network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges in march  the federal trade commission charged dish network

at the end of june  citing that amc networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels amc networks responded to dishs announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a  breach of contract lawsuit against dish network by former company parent rainbow medias voom hd networks in which it is seeking more than  billion in damages against dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract vooms highdefinition channels were carried on the provider from may   until may   when dish removed ten of vooms fifteen channels from its lineup the five remaining voom hd channels were removed from dish the day after however dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the amc networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms on may   dish network removed sundance channel from its channel lineup two weeks later on june   dish relocated amc we tv and ifc to higher channel positions with amc being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds amc moved from channel  to channel  for the sd feed and  for the hd feed we tv moved from channel  to channel  and ifc was moved from channel  to channel  the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with hdnet style and movieplex multiplex channel indieplex the move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a june  airing of an episode of mad men urging dish network customers to inform the company to keep the three amc networks channels on the satellite provider with dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels ratings on june   dish dropped the three amc networks properties replacing amc with hdnet movies ifc with hdnet which subsequently became axs tv two days later and we tv with style the move coincided with a new agreement between dish and att uverse on july   amc said in an emailed statement that it would stream over the internet the season premiere of breaking bad to dish customers dish subscribers can register online starting

and all  channels were moved from americas top  to  remarks on rural viewersedit during a conference call ergen stated after being asked about the removal of amc channels our customers are not looking at zombies in new york city they live in farms and ranches  we have data real data from our customers and for whatever reason our customers dont watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever ergen also said ive had satellite television for as long as satellite television has been around and theres never been one minute that i know of that anybody in my family or anybody whos came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels they have no clue about zombies in new york city marching around saying where is my amc soon after the call business insider blared the headline dish ceo says customers dont care about amc because they live on farms and ranches turner networksedit on october   during the early morning hours dish entered a dispute with time warners turner broadcasting system dish removed cnn hln cartoon networkadult swim boomerang trutv turner classic movies and cnn en español as the contract to carry those channels expired on october  tbs and tnt were not removed as they are carried under a different contract the channels were pulled without warning leaving

channels replaced turner classic movies with fxm and replaced trutv with esquire network during the duration of the dispute the dispute was settled and the turner network channels restored on november   hidden feesedit in january  thirteen states charged that echostar then the parent company of dish network had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers bank accounts for hidden fees the company settled the lawsuit paid  million and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with dish the shipping cost back in september of  was  as of june   the shipping cost is now  this fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed government subsidiesedit dish network received about  billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth dish network used the  federal communications act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the january  auction of wireless spectrum under the terms of that act designated entities qualify for a  percent discount on the market price of such licenses dish used small subsidiaries such as northstar wireless and snr wireless in order to qualify dish only paid  billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost  billion the difference would have been paid to the federal government the fec and the united states senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints litigationedit dish has been sued and countersued dozens of times in fact dish uses litigation as a profit center charlie ergen said i may be the only ceo who likes to go to depositions you can live in a bubble and you’re probably not going to get a disease but you can play in the mud and the dirt and you’re probably not going to get a disease either because you get immune to it you pick your poison and i think we choose to go play in the mud” in  dish admitted to using over  law firms over a tenyear period autohopedit on may   dish and the networks filed suit in federal court the dish case in manhattan and the networks cases in los angeles on may  us district judge laura taylor swain ruled the networks cases should not be filed in los angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to new york in july  preliminary judgement swain denied dishs request to set aside the issue of copyright violation ruling that dishs argument lacked specificity she also ruled that the case could be heard in los angeles thereby eliminating new york as a potential venue on november   the united states district court for the central district of california denied foxs motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because  ptat and autohop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract and  while qa copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract the harm from the copies was not irreparable but was compensable with money fox appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on july   the ninth circuit reviewed the district courts decision with a very deferential standard of review and affirmed it offthejob marijuana useedit dish fired a wheelchairbound quadriplegic man from his job as a telephone operator in  brandon coats for using medicalmarijuana during offwork hours coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms his paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash coats failed a random drug test coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee coats suit relied under a colorado law called the lawful offduty activities statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time the trial court and colorado court of appeals ruled in coats v dish network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law the trial court ruled that coats should have to pay dishs legal fees the appeals court overturned this ruling voomedit in april  rainbow media and dish network entered into a year affiliation agreement whereby echostar’s dish network obtained the right to distribute the voom channels until  and agreed that it would pay rainbow media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement the subscription fees started at  per subscriber in the first year of the agreement and were to increase to  per subscriber by the year  in a separate agreement echostar’s dish obtained a  ownership interest in rainbow media the business unit that contained the voom hd channels and rainbow agreed to invest  million into the voom service each year for the first five years of the agreement as a result echostars dish network announced that they would be adding ten of vooms original  channels to their lineup starting may  the remaining channels were added on february   in january  echostars dish network abandoned the affiliation agreement claiming that voom had failed to invest  million in the service during  although cablevision and rainbow provided dish network with the financial statements documenting their compliance dish network proceeded to remove ten of the channels from their lineup on may   with the remaining five removed the next day leaving coverage limited to cablevisions systems in new york new jersey connecticut and parts of pennsylvania cablevision and rainbow sued dish network for breach of contract and sought more than  billion in damages citing this drop in carriage and the ensuing lengthy litigation cablevision announced on december  that the voom hd suite would be discontinued as of january   to be replaced by other hd programming ultimately the channels ceased operations on january  and were replaced by multiplexed hd content from premium providers following the discovery process the court granted vooms motion for sanctions the new york state supreme court found that echostars dish network systematically destroyed evidence in the case and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by echostar demonstrated that echostar knew all along that there was no breachand would prove voom’s case” the judge also stated that he would tell jurors that dish network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to voom’s case according to sanford c bernstein analyst craig moffett in a recent wall street journal article cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party in this case the judge told the jury that echostar failed to preserve certain evidence he barred dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages additionally the court stated in its november   ruling “in conclusion the court notes echostar’s pattern of egregious conduct and questionable – and at times blatantly improper – litigation tactics echostar’s spoliation in this action and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court similarly egregious is echostar’s last minute finagling with expert reports believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture” the trial commenced on september   in the new york state supreme court during the summer of  financial analysts who cover dish urged the company to settle the lawsuit in advance of the trial as “the odds would…appear to be heavily in cablevision’samc’s favor” dish chose to settle the terms of the settlement required dish to pay  million for spectrum licenses covering  megahertz and capable of serving  million people foxedit main article fox broadcasting co v dish network llc on december   dish network dropped fox news channel and fox business network a failed first attempt to reach a deal on the th of the same month resulted in the blackout the two parties blamed each other dish said fox tried to unfairly tie in a

injunction against using some of tivos technology and was required to pay the dvr pioneer  million plus interest on may   dish network corporation and echostar corporation agreed to pay tivo inc  million to settle a dispute over the use of some of tivo’s technology this lawsuit took more than ten years to resolve one of the judges involved said that the conduct of dishs lawyers didnt “even

about  in  and  these transactions were criticized by analysts lev janashvili managing director at gmi ratings which tracks governance accounting and other risks in publicly traded companies said these are things to be concerned about because they raise reasonable questions about conflicts of interest and the overall integrity of governance at the company janashvili also said the investment in yottabytes ventures llc is a classic example of a related party transaction that warrants a closer scrutiny of the companys governance practices especially because this transaction is part of a broader pattern of behaviors that run counter to the interests of shareholders dish is a controlled company whose majority shareholder can insulate himself from the opinions of other investors investor relationsedit dish has reportedly been criticized for treating analysts and major shareholders poorly craig moffett senior analyst of us telecommunications us cable and satellite broadcasting at sanford c bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how dish does business ergen told him “we’re too busy creating value around here to sit down and talk about it thanks but no thanks” chris marangi a money manager for gamco investors which held about  millions shares in dish said that the company is very uncooperative he says that despite traveling to denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with ergen or any other dish senior manager “they’re probably the least transparent company of any i’ve ever dealt with dish sends out press releases on its earnings

satellite dishesedit dish network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by sanminasci corporation to echostar specifications prior to the december  merger of sci systems and sanmina dish network receivers were produced at factories in huntsville alabama and fountain colorado currentlywhen receiver assembly takes place in guadalajara mexico and india dish hd newest version used with the hopper and joey system earlier satellite dishesedit dish networks first satellite antenna was simply called the dish network dish it was retroactively named the dish  when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming dish  systems it uses one lnb to obtain signals from the °w orbital location and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional highdefinition or ethnic programming from either the °w or °w orbital locations the °w slot is one of two primary orbital locations the other being °w that provide core services after echostar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between askyb and mci worldcom it had more than doubled its capacity by adding  transponders at the °w orbital location since echostar also owned the adjacent °w orbital location it developed the dish  to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative duallnb assembly although the new inch dish  was slightly larger than the thencurrent inch dish  and directv dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from echostars two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical channel capacity the dish  as a result provided very large capacity for localintolocal service nationwide

newer systems some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are h boomerang science planet green pbs kids sprout and comedy central higher capacity satellite dishesedit dish  with turbohd branding mounted on a residential apartment railing in spite of all this capacity echostar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide highdefinition television and conceived the dish  system to receive signals from °w °w and °w orbital locations originally dish network highdefinition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes currently dish network subscribers can receive nationwide hdtv channels using the °w orbital location or °w orbital location because of issues with low signal strength the older model dish  has been replaced with the dish  the  has a  larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated lnb for easier installation the dish  is  in  mm in diameter even with the larger size there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the °w orbital location this has forced some customers to either use a nd separate dish network brand dish or an aftermarket  dish aimed specifically at the °w orbital location on several satellite related web support forums customers have critically suggested that the new dish  wasnt nearly large enough and should have been – larger to properly deal with rain fade later dish network took the approach of splitting the us into two regions subscribers west of chicago use dish  antennas aimed at the °w °w and °w orbital locations referred to as the western arc subscribers east of chicago use

criticisms and controversiesedit main article criticism of dish network since the early s dish network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers most notably when the hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without commercials major networks sued dish network autohopedit dish networks hopper digital video recorder announced in january  led to controversy over a feature called autohop which allows viewers to watch some programming without commercials subject to time restrictions autohop is an extension of the dvrs prime time recording capability when enabled the feature records but hides commercials giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercialfree commercials cannot be skipped until  am eastern time and the viewer must choose to do this recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired news of autohop met with an immediate polarized response the feature was deemed a dream come true for consumers but for networks a nightmare undercutting the revenue model dish asserted that autohop would encourage its customers to sample new programming leslie moonves cbs chief executive asked rhetorically how he is to produce csi without the revenue stream of commercials news corporation refused to accept dish advertising for the device a forrester research analyst said the move demonstrated dishs desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the internet the controversy surrounding autohop contributed to one smallmarket station group hoak media corporation removing its  stations channels from the service on june   in negotiations hoak sought a  percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the autohop feature david shull dish senior vice president of programming accused hoak of effectively telling dishs customers that they must watch commercials disrespecting customer control over its services eight days later the two companies announced a distribution deal terms were not disclosed on june   dish chairman charlie ergen told the united states house subcommittee on communications and technology that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and fast food advertising the next day michael petricone of the consumer electronics association spoke to the subcommittee likening hopper to earlier time shifting devices he argued that hopper is legal and that autohop entices people to watch more television thereby expanding televisions market cnet was also forced by parent company cbs to disqualify the newest hopper with sling model from the ces best in show award for  because of its active litigation with the company ceo joe clayton said that dish was saddened that cnets staff is being denied its editorial independence because of cbs heavy handed tactics dish network directly attacked cbs for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website the ad proclaimed the dvr as being cnets best in show but with a footnote stating that cbs will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying adskipping technology—even censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name hopper best in show your vote is the only one that really matters work environmentedit one news report described dish as having an ergencreated culture of condescension and distrust in  the investment analysis and commentary site  wall st named dish network  among americas worst companies to work for an assessment based upon employee reviews at the employment website glassdoorcom such reviews should be interpreted with caution however as reviews at such sites sample few employees compared to the company as a whole and are weighted towards exemployees with keenlyfelt grievances current and ambivalent exemployees are less likely to post reviews it should be noted that every company is subject to the same caveats and dish was still found to be the worst long hours little vacation time and too much mandatory overtime were all common complaints dishs toxic corporate culture was cited as a key difficulty in its aborted acquisition of sprint nextel david hekman a business professor at the university of colorado said this will be a huge issue for the sprint employees if theyre subjected to this meaner culture it could be a real wakeup call hekman also stated if he gets revolt from the sprint employees  then there will be no synergy and then the merger would be viewed as a failure dish was aware of the problem after announcing its attempted merger with sprint it took out a fullpage ad in the kansas city star declaring its commitment to building a company that can deliver sustained growth over many years the ad also said we look forward to the opportunity to work together with sprints board and its management team to develop a combined vision remaining mindful of how it will benefit customers employees shareholders and of course the kansas city community as things move forward we will stay in touch dish has very rapid employee turnover the company does not report exactly how many people it fires each quarter dish refers to its quarterly culling of employees as talent upgrades michael neuman a former president of dish quit after only eight months he said that ergen acts unilaterally and pounds people in submission no president of dish has remained in the job for more than four years and many left after only one year for years dish employees were required to clock in at the beginning of their day using fingerprint scanners this measure angered many employees the fingerprint scanners were eventually removed badges were previously used to monitor the arrival and departure of employees the company started using fingerprints after charles ergen noticed some employees helping each other swipe their badges for them if an employee is late an email is sent to human resources human resources will in turn contact the employees manager possibly even charlie ergen himself multiple former employees said it was common for ergen to scream publicly at executives for arriving even minutes late dish does not allow its employees to work from home for several years dish policy required that any tip over  percent given on an expensed meal would be subtracted from the paycheck of the responsible employee dish does not provide employees with company credit cards telemarketing violationsedit dish network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered dish network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges in march  the federal trade commission charged dish network and two of its dealers with multiple violations of the ftcs telemarketing sales rule and the telephone consumer protection act of  amc networksedit see also amc networks § dish network carriage dispute on march   dish network announced that it would no longer carry the amc networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite providers distribution agreement with the company at the end of june  citing that amc networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels amc networks responded to dishs announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a  breach of contract lawsuit against dish network by former company parent rainbow medias voom hd networks in which it is seeking more than  billion in damages against dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract vooms highdefinition channels were carried on the provider from may   until may   when dish removed ten of vooms fifteen channels from its lineup the five remaining voom hd channels were removed from dish the day after however dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the amc networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms on may   dish network removed sundance channel from its channel lineup two weeks later on june   dish relocated amc we tv and ifc to higher channel positions with amc being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds amc moved from channel  to channel  for the sd feed and  for the hd feed we tv moved from channel  to channel  and ifc was moved from channel  to channel  the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with hdnet style and movieplex multiplex channel indieplex the move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a june  airing of an episode of mad men urging dish network customers to inform the company to keep the three amc networks channels on the satellite provider with dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels ratings on june   dish dropped the three amc networks properties replacing amc with hdnet movies ifc with hdnet which subsequently became axs tv two days later and we tv with style the move coincided with a new agreement between dish and att uverse on july   amc said in an emailed statement that it would stream over the internet the season premiere of breaking bad to dish customers dish subscribers can register online starting july  for the show which airs on july  we want to give dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season on october   amc networks announced a settlement was

and all  channels were moved from americas top  to  remarks on rural viewersedit during a conference call ergen stated after being asked about the removal of amc channels our customers are not looking at zombies in new york city they live in farms and ranches  we have data real data from our customers and for whatever reason our customers dont watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever ergen also said ive had satellite television for as long as satellite television has been around and theres never been one minute that i know of that anybody in my family or anybody whos came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels they have no clue about zombies in new york city marching around saying where is my amc soon after the call business insider blared the headline dish ceo says customers dont care about amc because they live on farms and ranches turner networksedit

  hidden feesedit in january  thirteen states charged that echostar then the parent company of dish network had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers bank accounts for hidden fees the company settled the lawsuit paid  million and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with dish the shipping cost back in september of  was  as of june   the shipping cost is now  this fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed government subsidiesedit dish network received about  billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth dish network used the  federal communications act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the january  auction of wireless spectrum under the terms of that act designated entities qualify for a  percent discount on the market price of such licenses dish used small subsidiaries such as northstar wireless and snr wireless in order to qualify dish only paid  billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost  billion the difference would have been paid to the federal government the fec and the united states senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints litigationedit dish has been sued and countersued dozens of times in fact dish uses litigation as a profit center charlie ergen said i may be the only ceo who likes to go to depositions you can live in a bubble and you’re probably not going to get a disease but you can play in the mud and the dirt and you’re probably not going to get a disease either because you get immune to it you pick your poison and i think we choose to go play in the mud” in  dish admitted to using over  law firms over a tenyear period autohopedit on may   dish and the networks filed suit in federal court the dish case in manhattan and the networks cases in los angeles on may  us district judge laura taylor swain ruled the networks cases should not be filed in los angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to new york in july  preliminary judgement swain denied dishs request to set aside the issue of copyright violation ruling that dishs argument lacked specificity she also ruled that the case could be heard in los angeles thereby eliminating new york as a potential venue on november   the united states district court for the central district of california denied foxs motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because  ptat and autohop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract and  while qa copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract the harm from the copies was not irreparable but was compensable with money fox appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on july   the ninth circuit reviewed the district courts decision with a very deferential standard of review and affirmed it offthejob marijuana useedit dish fired a wheelchairbound quadriplegic man from his job as a telephone operator in  brandon coats for using medicalmarijuana during offwork hours coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms his paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash coats failed a random drug test coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee coats suit relied under a colorado law called the lawful offduty activities statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time the trial court and colorado court of appeals ruled in coats v dish network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law the trial court ruled that coats should have to pay dishs legal fees the appeals court overturned this ruling voomedit in april  rainbow media and dish network entered into a year affiliation agreement whereby echostar’s dish network obtained the right to distribute the voom channels until  and agreed that it would pay rainbow media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement the subscription fees started at  per subscriber in the first year of the agreement and were to increase to  per subscriber by the year  in a separate agreement echostar’s dish obtained a  ownership interest in rainbow media the business unit that contained the voom hd channels and rainbow agreed to invest

the discovery process the court granted vooms motion for sanctions the new york state supreme court found that echostars dish network systematically destroyed evidence in the case and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by echostar demonstrated that echostar knew all along that there was no breachand would prove voom’s case” the judge also stated that he would tell jurors that dish network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to voom’s case according to sanford c bernstein analyst craig moffett in a recent wall street journal article cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party in this case the judge told the jury that echostar failed to preserve certain evidence he barred dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages additionally the court stated in its november   ruling “in conclusion the court notes echostar’s pattern of egregious conduct and questionable – and at times blatantly improper – litigation tactics echostar’s spoliation in this action and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court similarly egregious is echostar’s last minute finagling with expert reports believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture” the trial commenced on september   in the new york state supreme court during the summer of  financial analysts who cover

these are things to be concerned about because they raise reasonable questions about conflicts of interest and the overall integrity of governance at the company janashvili also said the investment in yottabytes ventures llc is a classic example of a related party transaction that warrants a closer scrutiny of the companys governance practices especially because this transaction is part of a

never been able to get a meeting with ergen or any other dish senior manager “they’re probably the least transparent company of any i’ve ever dealt with dish sends out press releases on its earnings

satellite dishesedit dish network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by sanminasci corporation to echostar specifications prior to the december  merger of sci systems and sanmina dish network receivers were produced at factories in huntsville alabama and fountain colorado currentlywhen receiver assembly takes place in guadalajara mexico and india dish hd newest version used with the hopper and joey system earlier satellite dishesedit dish networks first satellite antenna was simply called the dish network dish it was retroactively named the dish  when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming dish  systems it uses one lnb to obtain signals from the °w orbital location and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional highdefinition or ethnic programming from either the °w or °w orbital locations the °w slot is one of two primary orbital locations the other being °w that provide core services after echostar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between askyb and mci worldcom it had more than doubled its capacity by adding  transponders at the °w orbital location since echostar also owned the adjacent °w orbital location it developed the dish  to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative duallnb assembly although the new inch dish  was slightly larger than the thencurrent inch dish  and directv dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from echostars two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical channel capacity the dish  as a result provided very large capacity for localintolocal service nationwide

hdtv channels using the °w orbital location or °w orbital location because of issues with low signal strength the older model dish  has been replaced with the dish  the  has a  larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated lnb for easier installation the dish  is  in  mm in diameter even with the larger size there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the °w orbital location this has forced some customers to either use a nd separate dish network brand dish or an aftermarket  dish aimed specifically at the °w orbital location on several satellite

criticisms and controversiesedit main article criticism of dish network since the early s dish network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers most notably when the hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without commercials major networks sued dish network autohopedit dish networks hopper digital video recorder announced in january  led to controversy over a feature called autohop which allows viewers to watch some programming without commercials subject to time restrictions autohop is an extension of the dvrs prime time recording capability when enabled the feature records but hides commercials giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercialfree commercials cannot be skipped until  am eastern time and the viewer must choose to do this recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired news of autohop met with an immediate polarized response the feature was deemed a dream come true for consumers but for networks a nightmare undercutting the revenue model dish asserted that autohop would encourage its customers to sample new programming leslie moonves cbs chief executive asked rhetorically how he is to produce csi without the revenue stream of commercials news corporation refused to accept dish advertising for the device a forrester research analyst said the move demonstrated dishs desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the internet the controversy surrounding autohop contributed to one smallmarket station group hoak media corporation removing its  stations channels from the service on june   in negotiations hoak sought a  percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the autohop feature david shull dish senior vice president of programming accused hoak of effectively telling dishs customers that they must watch commercials disrespecting customer control over its services eight days later the two companies announced a distribution deal terms were not disclosed on june   dish chairman charlie ergen told the united states house subcommittee on communications and technology that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and fast food advertising the next day michael petricone of the consumer electronics association spoke to the subcommittee likening hopper to earlier time shifting devices he argued that hopper is legal and that autohop entices people to watch more television thereby expanding televisions market cnet was also forced by parent company cbs to disqualify the newest hopper with sling model from the ces best in show award for  because of its active litigation with the company ceo joe clayton said that dish was saddened that cnets staff is being denied its editorial independence because of cbs heavy handed tactics dish network directly attacked cbs for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website the ad proclaimed the dvr as being cnets best in show but with a footnote stating that cbs will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying adskipping technology—even censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name hopper best in show your vote is the only one that really matters work environmentedit one news report described dish as having an ergencreated culture of condescension and distrust in  the investment analysis and commentary site  wall st named dish network  among americas worst companies to work for an assessment based upon employee reviews at the employment website glassdoorcom such reviews should be interpreted with caution however as reviews at such sites sample few employees compared to the company as a whole and are weighted towards exemployees with keenlyfelt grievances current and ambivalent exemployees are less likely to post reviews it should be noted that every company is subject to the same caveats and dish was still found to be the worst long hours little vacation time and too much mandatory overtime were all common complaints dishs toxic corporate culture was cited as a key difficulty in its aborted acquisition of sprint nextel david hekman a business professor at the university of colorado said this will be a huge issue for the sprint employees if theyre subjected to this meaner culture it could be a real wakeup call hekman also stated if he gets revolt from the sprint employees  then there will be no synergy and then the merger would be viewed as a failure dish was aware of the problem after announcing its attempted merger with sprint it took out a fullpage ad in the kansas city star declaring its commitment to building a company that can deliver sustained growth over many years the ad also said we look forward to the opportunity to work together with sprints board and its management team to develop a combined vision remaining mindful of how it will benefit customers employees shareholders and of course the kansas city community as things move forward we will stay in touch dish has very rapid employee turnover the company does not report exactly how many people it fires each quarter dish refers to its quarterly culling of employees as talent upgrades michael neuman a former president of dish quit after only eight months he said that ergen acts unilaterally and pounds people in submission no president of dish has remained in the job for more than four years and many left after only one year for years dish employees were required to clock in at the beginning of their day using fingerprint scanners this measure angered many employees the fingerprint scanners were eventually removed badges were previously used to monitor the arrival and departure of employees the company started using fingerprints after charles ergen noticed some employees helping each other swipe their badges for them if an employee is late an email is sent to human resources human resources will in turn contact the employees manager possibly even charlie ergen himself multiple former employees said it was common for ergen to scream publicly at executives for arriving even minutes late dish does not allow its employees to work from home for several years dish policy required that any tip over  percent given on an expensed meal would be subtracted from the paycheck of the responsible employee dish does not provide employees with company credit cards telemarketing violationsedit dish network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered dish network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges in march  the federal trade commission charged dish network and two of its dealers with multiple violations of the ftcs telemarketing sales rule and the telephone consumer protection act of  amc networksedit see also amc networks § dish network carriage dispute on march   dish network announced that it would no longer carry the amc networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite providers distribution agreement with the company at the end of june  citing that amc networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels amc networks responded to dishs announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a  breach of contract lawsuit against dish network by former company parent rainbow medias voom hd networks in which it is seeking more than  billion in damages against dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract vooms highdefinition channels were carried on the provider from may   until may   when dish removed ten of vooms fifteen channels from its lineup the five remaining voom hd channels were removed from dish the day after however dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the amc networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms on may   dish network removed sundance channel from its channel lineup two weeks later on june   dish relocated amc we tv and ifc to higher channel positions with amc being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds amc moved from channel  to channel  for the sd feed and  for the hd feed we tv moved from channel  to channel  and ifc was moved from channel  to channel  the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with hdnet style and movieplex multiplex channel indieplex the move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a june  airing of an episode of mad men urging dish network customers to inform the company to keep the three amc networks channels on the satellite provider with dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels ratings on june   dish dropped the three amc networks properties replacing amc with hdnet movies ifc with hdnet which subsequently became axs tv two days later and we tv with style the move coincided with a new agreement between dish and att uverse on july   amc said in an emailed statement that it would stream over the internet the season premiere of breaking bad to dish customers dish subscribers can register online starting july  for the show which airs on july  we want to give dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season on october   amc networks announced a settlement was reached between them cablevision and dish in which dish was forced to pay up to  million in damages to cablevision for damages from removing voom owned channels off the dish lineup back in  and in return dish signed a new agreement to bring the amc networks owned channels back on the dish lineup with amc returning october  and the rest on november st also dish simultaneously brought back fuse and all  channels were moved from americas top  to  remarks on rural viewersedit during a conference call ergen stated after being asked about the removal of amc channels our customers are not looking at zombies in new york city they live in farms and ranches  we have data real data from our customers and for whatever reason our customers dont watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever ergen also said ive had satellite television for as long as satellite television has been around and theres never been one minute that i know of that anybody in my family or anybody whos came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels they have no clue about zombies in new york city marching around saying where is my amc soon after the call business insider blared the headline dish ceo says customers dont care about amc because they live on farms and ranches turner networksedit on october   during the early morning hours dish entered a dispute with time warners turner broadcasting system dish removed cnn hln cartoon networkadult swim boomerang trutv turner classic movies and cnn en español as the contract to carry those channels expired on october  tbs and tnt were not removed as they are carried under a different contract the channels were pulled without warning leaving many with questions dish replaced cnn and hln with msnbc replaced cartoon network and boomerang with nicktoons except for the west feed which was replaced by a message about the removal of the channels replaced turner classic movies with fxm and replaced trutv with esquire network during the duration of the dispute the dispute was settled and the turner network channels restored on november   hidden feesedit in january  thirteen states charged that echostar then the parent company of dish network had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers bank accounts for hidden fees the company settled the lawsuit paid  million and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with dish the shipping cost back in september of  was  as of june   the shipping cost is now  this fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed government subsidiesedit dish network received about  billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth dish network used the  federal communications act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the january  auction of wireless spectrum under the terms of that act designated entities qualify for a  percent discount on the market price of such licenses dish used small subsidiaries such as northstar wireless and snr wireless in order to qualify dish only paid  billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost  billion the difference would have been paid to the federal government the fec and the united states senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints litigationedit dish has been sued and countersued dozens of times in fact dish uses litigation as a profit center charlie ergen said i may be the only ceo who likes to go to depositions you can live in a bubble and you’re probably not going to get a disease but you can play in the mud and the dirt and you’re probably not going to get a disease either because you get immune to it you pick your poison and i think we choose to go play in the mud” in  dish admitted to using over  law firms over a tenyear period autohopedit on may   dish and the networks filed suit in federal court the dish case in manhattan and the networks cases in los angeles on may  us district judge laura taylor swain ruled the networks cases should not be filed in los angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to new york in july  preliminary judgement swain denied dishs request to set aside the issue of copyright violation ruling that dishs argument lacked specificity she also ruled that the case could be heard in los angeles thereby eliminating new york as a potential venue on november   the united states district court for the central district of california denied foxs motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because  ptat and autohop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract and  while qa copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract the harm from the copies was not irreparable but was compensable with money fox appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on july   the ninth circuit reviewed the district courts decision with a very deferential standard of review and affirmed it offthejob marijuana useedit dish fired a wheelchairbound quadriplegic man from his job as a telephone operator in  brandon coats for using medicalmarijuana during offwork hours coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms his paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash coats failed a random drug test coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee coats suit relied under a colorado law called the lawful offduty activities statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time the trial court and colorado court of appeals ruled in coats v dish network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law the trial court ruled that coats should have to pay dishs legal fees the appeals court overturned this ruling voomedit in april  rainbow media and dish network entered into a year affiliation agreement whereby echostar’s dish network obtained the right to distribute the voom channels until  and agreed that it would pay rainbow media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement the subscription fees started at  per subscriber in the first year of the agreement and were to increase to  per subscriber by the year  in a separate agreement echostar’s dish obtained a  ownership interest in rainbow media the business unit that contained the voom hd channels and rainbow agreed to invest  million into the voom service each year for the first five years of the agreement as a result echostars dish network announced that they would be adding ten of vooms original  channels to their lineup starting may  the remaining channels were added on february   in january  echostars dish network abandoned the affiliation agreement claiming that voom had failed to invest  million in the service during  although cablevision and rainbow provided dish network with the financial statements documenting their compliance dish network proceeded to remove ten of the channels from their lineup on may   with the remaining five removed the next day leaving coverage limited to cablevisions systems in new york new jersey connecticut and parts of pennsylvania cablevision and rainbow sued dish network for breach of contract and sought more than  billion in damages citing this drop in carriage and the ensuing lengthy litigation cablevision announced on december  that the voom hd suite would be discontinued as of january   to be replaced by other hd programming ultimately the channels ceased operations on january  and were replaced by multiplexed hd content from premium providers following the discovery process the court granted vooms motion for sanctions the new york state supreme court found that echostars dish network systematically destroyed evidence in the case and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by echostar demonstrated that echostar knew all along that there was no breachand would prove voom’s case” the judge also stated that he would tell jurors that dish network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to voom’s case according to sanford c bernstein analyst craig moffett in a recent wall street journal article cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party in this case the judge told the jury that echostar failed to preserve certain evidence he barred dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages additionally the court stated in its november   ruling “in conclusion the court notes echostar’s pattern of egregious conduct and questionable – and at times blatantly improper – litigation tactics echostar’s spoliation in this action and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court similarly egregious is echostar’s last minute finagling with expert reports believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture” the trial commenced on september   in the new york state supreme court during the summer of  financial analysts who cover dish urged the company to settle the lawsuit in advance of the trial as “the odds would…appear to be heavily in cablevision’samc’s favor” dish chose to settle the terms of the settlement required dish to pay  million for spectrum licenses covering  megahertz and capable of serving  million people foxedit main article fox broadcasting co v dish network llc on december   dish network dropped fox news channel and fox business network a failed first attempt to reach a deal on the th of the same month resulted in the blackout the two parties blamed each other dish said fox tried to unfairly tie in a

injunction against using some of tivos technology and was required to pay the dvr pioneer  million plus interest on may   dish network corporation and echostar corporation agreed to pay tivo inc  million to settle a dispute over the use of some of tivo’s technology this lawsuit took more than ten years to resolve one of the judges involved said that the conduct of dishs lawyers didnt “even

about  in  and  these transactions were criticized by analysts lev janashvili managing director at gmi ratings which tracks governance accounting and other risks in publicly traded companies said these are things to be concerned about because they raise reasonable questions about conflicts of interest and the overall integrity of governance at the company janashvili also said the investment in yottabytes ventures llc is a classic example of a related party transaction that warrants a closer scrutiny of the companys governance practices especially because this transaction is part of a broader pattern of behaviors that run counter to the interests of shareholders dish is a controlled company whose majority shareholder can insulate himself from the opinions of other investors investor relationsedit dish has reportedly been criticized for treating analysts and major shareholders poorly craig moffett senior analyst of us telecommunications us cable and satellite broadcasting at sanford c bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how dish does business ergen told him “we’re too busy creating value around here to sit down and talk about it thanks but no thanks” chris marangi a money manager for gamco investors which held about  millions shares in dish said that the company is very uncooperative he says that despite traveling to denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with ergen or any other dish senior manager “they’re probably the least transparent company of any i’ve ever dealt with dish sends out press releases on its earnings

after news corps bskyb service in britain the two companies had nearly merged which called for dish network being renamed sky before it was called off due to charlie ergens clashes with news corp executives with this purchase echostar obtained  of the  transponder licenses in the ° west orbital slot more than doubling existing continental united states broadcasting capacity at a value of  million some of the other assets were picked up by rival primestar which was sold to directv in  the acquisition which also included an uplink center in gilbert arizona inspired the company to

veritable buying rampage in the bargain bin this includes the april   purchase of blockbuster inc in a bankruptcy auction in new york agreeing to pay  million in cash and assume  million in liabilities and other obligations for the nationwide videorental company dish network also acquired the defunct companies dbsd and terrestar dish network also made a bid to purchase hulu on october

adding wireless internet and mobile video services that can compete with netflix and cable companies about the new markets ergen said given the assets weve been accumulating i dont think its hard to see were moving in a different direction from simply paytv which is a market thats becoming increasingly saturated dish network put its blockbuster acquisition to work by making available dish movie

satellite dishesedit dish network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by sanminasci corporation to echostar specifications prior to the december  merger of sci systems and sanmina dish network receivers were produced at factories in huntsville alabama and fountain colorado currentlywhen receiver assembly takes place in guadalajara mexico and india dish hd newest version used with the hopper and joey system earlier satellite dishesedit dish networks first satellite antenna was simply called the dish network dish it was retroactively named the dish  when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming dish  systems it uses one lnb to obtain signals from the °w orbital location and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional highdefinition or ethnic programming from either the °w or °w orbital locations the °w slot is one of two primary orbital locations the other being °w that provide core services after echostar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between askyb and mci worldcom it had more than doubled its capacity by adding  transponders at the °w orbital location since echostar also owned the adjacent °w orbital location it developed the dish  to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative duallnb assembly although the new inch dish  was slightly larger than the thencurrent inch dish  and directv dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from echostars two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical channel capacity the dish  as a result provided very large capacity for localintolocal service nationwide programming and business services in order to migrate existing customers to dish  dish network provides valueadded channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the dish  and newer systems some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are h boomerang science planet green pbs kids sprout and comedy central higher capacity satellite dishesedit dish  with turbohd branding mounted on a residential apartment railing in spite of all this capacity echostar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide highdefinition television and conceived the dish  system to receive signals from °w °w and °w orbital locations originally dish network highdefinition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes currently dish network subscribers can receive nationwide hdtv channels using the °w orbital location or °w orbital location because of issues with low signal strength the older model dish  has been replaced with the dish  the  has a  larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated lnb for easier installation the dish  is  in  mm in diameter even with the larger size there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the °w orbital location this has forced some customers to either use a nd separate dish network brand dish or an aftermarket  dish aimed specifically at the °w orbital location on several satellite related web support forums customers have critically suggested that the new dish  wasnt nearly large enough and should have been – larger to properly deal with rain fade later dish network took the approach of splitting the us into two regions subscribers west of chicago use dish  antennas aimed at the °w °w and °w orbital locations referred to as the western arc subscribers east of chicago use dish  antennas aimed at the °w °w and °w oribital locations referred to as the eastern arc superdish  mounted on a roof during dish networks quest for capacity they had accumulated an array of satellite broadcasting technologies orbital locations and surplus capacity using nonmainstream technologies requiring larger dish sizes to capitalize on these broadcasting assets dish network started providing extensive ethnic programming from lowerpowered satellites broadcasting in the nondbs portion of the fss band dish network offers specialized equipment for these customers including larger dish antennascitation needed the superdish dish  and dish  systems receive dbs signals from both of the primary °w and °w locations °w for dish  as well as lowerpowered fss signals from either °w °w

dish network has used standard mpeg for broadcasting the addition of bandwidthintensive hdtv in a limitedbandwidth world has called for a change to an hmpeg avc system dish network announced as of february   that all new hdtv channels would be available in h format only while maintaining the current lineup as mpeg dish network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to h in order to

criticisms and controversiesedit main article criticism of dish network since the early s dish network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers most notably when the hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without commercials major networks sued dish network autohopedit dish networks hopper digital video recorder announced in january  led to controversy over a feature called autohop which allows viewers to watch some programming without commercials subject to time restrictions autohop is an extension of the dvrs prime time recording capability when enabled the feature records but hides commercials giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercialfree commercials cannot be skipped until  am eastern time and the viewer must choose to do this recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired news of autohop met with an immediate polarized response the feature was deemed a dream come true for consumers but for networks a nightmare undercutting the revenue model dish asserted that autohop would encourage its customers to sample new programming leslie moonves cbs chief executive asked rhetorically how he is to produce csi without the revenue stream of commercials news corporation refused to accept dish advertising for the device a forrester research analyst said the move demonstrated dishs desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the internet the controversy surrounding autohop contributed to one smallmarket station group hoak media corporation removing its  stations channels from the service on june   in negotiations hoak sought a  percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the autohop feature david shull dish senior vice president of programming accused hoak of effectively telling dishs customers that they must watch commercials disrespecting customer control over its services eight days later the two companies announced a distribution deal terms were not disclosed on june   dish chairman charlie ergen told the united states house subcommittee on communications and technology that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and fast food advertising the next day michael petricone of the consumer electronics association spoke to the subcommittee likening hopper to earlier time shifting devices he argued that hopper is legal and that autohop entices people to watch more television thereby expanding televisions market cnet was also forced by parent company cbs to disqualify the newest hopper with sling model from the ces best in show award for  because of its active litigation with the company ceo joe clayton said that dish was saddened that cnets staff is being denied its editorial independence because of cbs heavy handed tactics dish network directly attacked cbs for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website the ad proclaimed the dvr as being cnets best in show but with a footnote stating that cbs will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying adskipping technology—even censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name hopper best in show your vote is the only one that really matters work environmentedit one news report described dish as having an ergencreated culture of condescension and distrust in  the investment analysis and commentary site  wall st named dish network  among americas worst companies to work for an assessment based upon employee reviews at the employment website glassdoorcom such reviews should be interpreted with caution however as reviews at such sites sample few employees compared to the company as a whole and are weighted towards exemployees with keenlyfelt grievances current and ambivalent exemployees are less likely to post reviews it should be noted that every company is subject to the same caveats and dish was still found to be the worst long hours little vacation time and too much mandatory overtime were all common complaints dishs toxic corporate culture was cited as a key difficulty in its aborted acquisition of sprint nextel david hekman a business professor at the university of colorado said this will be a huge issue for the sprint employees if theyre subjected to this meaner culture it could be a real wakeup call hekman also stated if he gets revolt from the sprint employees  then there will be no synergy and then the merger would be viewed as a failure dish was aware of the problem after announcing its attempted merger with sprint it took out a fullpage ad in the kansas city star declaring its commitment to building a company that can deliver sustained growth over many years the ad also said we look forward to the opportunity to work together with sprints board and its management team to develop a combined vision remaining mindful of how it will benefit customers employees shareholders and of course the kansas city community as things move forward we will stay in touch dish has very rapid employee turnover the company does not report exactly how many people it fires each quarter dish refers to its quarterly culling of employees as talent upgrades michael neuman a former president of dish quit after only eight months he said that ergen acts unilaterally and pounds people in submission no president of dish has remained in the job for more than four years and many left after only one year for years dish employees were required to clock in at the beginning of their day using fingerprint scanners this measure angered many employees the fingerprint scanners were eventually removed badges were previously used to monitor the arrival and departure of employees the company started using fingerprints after charles ergen noticed some employees helping each other swipe their badges for them if an employee is late an email is sent to human resources human resources will in turn contact the employees manager possibly even charlie ergen himself multiple former employees said it was common for ergen to scream publicly at executives for arriving even minutes late dish does not allow its employees to work from home for several years dish policy required that any tip over  percent given on an expensed meal would be subtracted from the paycheck of the responsible employee dish does not provide employees with company credit cards telemarketing violationsedit dish network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered dish network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges in march  the federal trade commission charged dish network and two of its dealers with multiple violations of the ftcs telemarketing sales rule and the telephone consumer protection act of  amc networksedit see also amc networks § dish network carriage dispute on march   dish network announced that it would no longer carry the amc networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite providers distribution agreement with the company at the end of june  citing that amc networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels amc networks responded to dishs announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a  breach of contract lawsuit against dish network by former company parent rainbow medias voom hd networks in which it is seeking more than  billion in damages against dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract vooms highdefinition channels were carried on the provider from may   until may   when dish removed ten of vooms fifteen channels from its lineup the five remaining voom hd channels were removed from dish the day after however dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the amc networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms on may   dish network removed sundance channel from its channel lineup two weeks later on june   dish relocated amc we tv and ifc to higher channel positions with amc being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds amc moved from channel  to channel  for the sd feed and  for the hd feed we tv moved from channel  to channel  and ifc was moved from channel  to channel  the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with hdnet style and movieplex multiplex channel indieplex the move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a june  airing of an episode of mad men urging dish network customers to inform the company to keep the three amc networks channels on the satellite provider with dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels ratings on june   dish dropped the three amc networks properties replacing amc with hdnet movies ifc with hdnet which subsequently became axs tv two days later and we tv with style the move coincided with a new agreement between dish and att uverse on july   amc said in an emailed statement that it would stream over the internet the season premiere of breaking bad to dish customers dish subscribers can register online starting july  for the show which airs on july  we want to give dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season on october   amc networks announced a settlement was reached between them cablevision and dish in which dish was forced to pay up to  million in damages to cablevision for damages from removing voom owned channels off the dish lineup back in  and in return dish signed a new agreement to bring the amc networks owned channels back on the dish lineup with amc returning october  and the rest on november st also dish simultaneously brought back fuse and all  channels were moved from americas top  to  remarks on rural viewersedit during a conference call ergen stated after being asked about the removal of amc channels our customers are not looking at zombies in new york city they live in farms and ranches  we have data real data from our customers and for whatever reason our customers dont watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever ergen also said ive had satellite television for as long as satellite television has been around and theres never been one minute that i know of that anybody in my family or anybody whos came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels they have no clue about zombies in new york city marching around saying where is my amc soon after the call business insider blared the headline dish ceo says customers dont care about amc because they live on farms and ranches turner networksedit on october   during the early morning hours dish entered a dispute with time warners turner broadcasting system dish removed cnn hln cartoon networkadult swim boomerang trutv turner classic movies and cnn en español as the contract to carry those channels expired on october  tbs and tnt were not removed as they are carried under a different contract the channels were pulled without warning leaving many with questions dish replaced cnn and hln with msnbc replaced cartoon network and boomerang with nicktoons except for the west feed which was replaced by a message about the removal of the channels replaced turner classic movies with fxm and replaced trutv with esquire network during the duration of the dispute the dispute was settled and the turner network channels restored on november   hidden feesedit in january  thirteen states charged that echostar then the parent company of dish network had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers bank accounts for hidden fees the company settled the lawsuit paid  million and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with dish the shipping cost back in september of  was  as of june   the shipping cost is now  this fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed government subsidiesedit dish network received about  billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth dish network used the  federal communications act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the january  auction of wireless spectrum under the terms of that act designated entities qualify for a  percent discount on the market price of such licenses dish used small subsidiaries such as northstar wireless and snr wireless in order to qualify dish only paid  billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost  billion the difference would have been paid to the federal government the fec and the united states senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints litigationedit dish has been sued and countersued dozens of times in fact dish uses litigation as a profit center charlie ergen said i may be the only ceo who likes to go to depositions you can live in a bubble and you’re probably not going to get a disease but you can play in the mud and the dirt and you’re probably not going to get a disease either because you get immune to it you pick your poison and i think we choose to go play in the mud” in  dish admitted to using over  law firms over a tenyear period autohopedit on may   dish and the networks filed suit in federal court the dish case in manhattan and the networks cases in los angeles on may  us district judge laura taylor swain ruled the networks cases should not be filed in los angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to new york in july  preliminary judgement swain denied dishs request to set aside the issue of copyright violation ruling that dishs argument lacked specificity she also ruled that the case could be heard in los angeles thereby eliminating new york as a potential venue on november   the united states district court for the central district of california denied foxs motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because  ptat and autohop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract and  while qa copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract the harm from the copies was not irreparable but was compensable with money fox appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on july   the ninth circuit reviewed the district courts decision with a very deferential standard of review and affirmed it offthejob marijuana useedit dish fired a wheelchairbound quadriplegic man from his job as a telephone operator in  brandon coats for using medicalmarijuana during offwork hours coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms his paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash coats failed a random drug test coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee coats suit relied under a colorado law called the lawful offduty activities statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time the trial court and colorado court of appeals ruled in coats v dish network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law the trial court ruled that coats should have to pay dishs legal fees the appeals court overturned this ruling voomedit in april  rainbow media and dish network entered into a year affiliation agreement whereby echostar’s dish network obtained the right to distribute the voom channels until  and agreed that it would pay rainbow media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement the subscription fees started at  per subscriber in the first year of the agreement and were to increase to  per subscriber by the year  in a separate agreement echostar’s dish obtained a  ownership interest in rainbow media the business unit that contained the voom hd channels and rainbow agreed to invest  million into the voom service each year for the first five years of the agreement as a result echostars dish network announced that they would be adding ten of vooms original  channels to their lineup starting may  the remaining channels were added on february   in january  echostars dish network abandoned the affiliation agreement claiming that voom had failed to invest  million in the service during  although cablevision and rainbow provided dish network with the financial statements documenting their compliance dish network proceeded to remove ten of the channels from their lineup on may   with the remaining five removed the next day leaving coverage limited to cablevisions systems in new york new jersey connecticut and parts of pennsylvania cablevision and rainbow sued dish network for breach of contract and sought more than  billion in damages citing this drop in carriage and the ensuing lengthy litigation cablevision announced on december  that the voom hd suite would be discontinued as of january   to be replaced by other hd programming ultimately the channels ceased operations on january  and were replaced by multiplexed hd content from premium providers following the discovery process the court granted vooms motion for sanctions the new york state supreme court found that echostars dish network systematically destroyed evidence in the case and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by echostar demonstrated that echostar knew all along that there was no breachand would prove voom’s case” the judge also stated that he would tell jurors that dish network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to voom’s case according to sanford c bernstein analyst craig moffett in a recent wall street journal article cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party in this case the judge told the jury that echostar failed to preserve certain evidence he barred dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages additionally the court stated in its november   ruling “in conclusion the court notes echostar’s pattern of egregious conduct and questionable – and at times blatantly improper – litigation tactics echostar’s spoliation in this action and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court similarly egregious is echostar’s last minute finagling with expert reports believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture” the trial commenced on september   in the new york state supreme court during the summer of  financial analysts who cover dish urged the company to settle the lawsuit in advance of the trial as “the odds would…appear to be heavily in cablevision’samc’s favor” dish chose to settle the terms of the settlement required dish to pay  million for spectrum licenses covering  megahertz and capable of serving  million people foxedit main article fox broadcasting co v dish network llc on december   dish network dropped fox news channel and fox business network a failed first attempt to reach a deal on the th of the same month resulted in the blackout the two parties blamed each other dish said fox tried to unfairly tie in a sister channel and charge unreasonable rates fox pointed out the recent pattern dish had created with other networks a deal was finally reached on january   with undisclosed terms tivo patent lawsuitedit main article tivo inc v echostar corp on june   satellite service provider echostar was found by marshall texas federal district court judge david folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of tivos technology and was required to pay the dvr pioneer  million plus interest on may   dish network corporation and echostar corporation agreed to pay tivo inc  million to settle a dispute over the use of some of tivo’s technology this lawsuit took more than ten years to resolve one of the judges involved said that the conduct of dishs lawyers didnt “even meet lawschool student behavior” and “presented the saddest day i have seen in my many years in court” bartlit beck herman palenchar  scottedit dish sued its own law firm bartlit beck herman palenchar  scott of chicago for malpractice the firm countersued and won a  million judgement against dish a panel from the american arbitration association said that dishs allegations were patently false and egregious related party transactionsedit in  dish invested  in a technology startup yottabyte ventures llc in which christoper ergen the son of ceo charlie ergen has  percent equity yottabytes

reseller agreement dish paid another firm owned by chase ergen  during  and  candy ergen charlie ergens wife is paid between  to  per year in consulting fees other unnamed children of ergen received about  in  and  these transactions were criticized by analysts lev janashvili managing director at gmi ratings which tracks governance accounting and other risks in publicly traded companies said these are things to be concerned about because they raise reasonable questions about conflicts of interest and the overall integrity of governance at the company janashvili also said the investment in yottabytes ventures llc is a classic example of a related party transaction that warrants a closer scrutiny of the companys governance practices especially because this transaction is part of a broader pattern of behaviors that run counter to the interests of shareholders dish is a controlled company whose majority shareholder can insulate himself from the opinions of other investors investor relationsedit dish has reportedly been criticized for treating analysts and major shareholders poorly craig moffett senior analyst of us telecommunications us cable and satellite broadcasting at sanford c bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how dish does business ergen told him “we’re too busy creating value around here to sit down and talk about it thanks but no thanks” chris marangi a money manager for gamco investors which held about  millions shares in dish said that the company is very uncooperative he says that despite traveling to denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with ergen or any other dish senior manager “they’re probably the least transparent company of any i’ve ever dealt with dish sends out press releases on its earnings deliberately late enough to be of little or no use to analysts and investors whom are then forced to sort through complicated filings submitted to the securities and exchange commission hearst

overall drop experienced by the paytelevision industry at large and relatively in line with its satellite rival directv which is now owned by att nyset in q dish gained  subscribers while att added  and the entire industry was up  new paying customers according to research from leichtman research group in q the industry dropped nearly half a million subscribers while dish lost  and atts directv lost  in q the last period for which numbers have been reported the industry bounced back and lost only  subscribers with dish dropping  and directv adding   so what dish does not break out numbers for sling in its earnings reports but its fair to say that the streaming service has not yet become a blockbuster hit the company did say it has  subscribers to the service as the end of march during an august earnings call according to the street which estimates total sling subscriptions at around  now those numbers may be a little lower than the company had hoped for though it has not shared any sales projections but its still very early in the streaming video game in a broad sense dish operates in a declining industry and while sling may be a hedge against that it has not yet proven its value now what dish needs to keep as many fullprice satellite customers as it can while also adding cordcutters to its sling user base the challenge for the company is that it needs to win users from its rivals for sling while not cannibalizing its own customer base the company has a long road ahead of it but offering a lowcost purestreaming service for cordcutters gives it a marketplace versatility that rivals including att do not have it may be a long time before that advantage matters but sling is a good service that should be the companys longterm salvation daniel kline has no

satellite broadcasting joint venture of news corporation and mci worldcom called askyb for american sky broadcasting named after news corps bskyb service in britain the two companies had nearly merged which called for dish network being renamed sky before it was called off due to charlie ergens clashes with news corp executives with this purchase echostar obtained  of the  transponder licenses in the ° west orbital slot more than doubling existing continental united states broadcasting capacity at a value of  million some of the other assets were picked up by rival primestar which was sold to

anatel they await the authorization of the application technical informationedit satellite dishesedit dish network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by sanminasci corporation to echostar specifications prior to the december  merger of sci systems and sanmina dish network receivers were produced at factories in huntsville alabama and fountain colorado currentlywhen receiver assembly takes place in guadalajara mexico and india dish hd newest version used with the hopper and joey system earlier satellite dishesedit dish networks first satellite antenna was simply called the dish network dish it was retroactively named the dish  when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming dish  systems it uses one lnb to obtain signals from the °w orbital location and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional highdefinition or ethnic programming from either the °w or °w orbital locations the °w slot is one of two primary orbital locations the other being °w that provide core services after echostar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between askyb and mci worldcom it had more than doubled its capacity by adding  transponders at the °w orbital location since echostar also owned the adjacent °w orbital location it developed the dish  to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative duallnb assembly although the new inch dish  was slightly larger than the thencurrent inch dish  and directv dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from echostars two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical channel capacity the dish  as a result provided very large capacity for localintolocal service nationwide programming and business services in order to migrate existing customers to dish  dish network provides valueadded channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the dish  and newer systems some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are h boomerang science planet green pbs kids sprout and comedy central higher capacity satellite dishesedit dish  with turbohd branding mounted on a residential apartment railing in spite of all this capacity echostar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide highdefinition television and conceived the dish  system to receive signals from °w °w and °w orbital locations originally dish network highdefinition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes currently dish network subscribers can receive nationwide hdtv channels using the °w orbital location or °w orbital location because of issues with low signal strength the older model dish  has been replaced with the dish  the  has a  larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated lnb for easier installation the dish  is  in  mm in diameter even with the larger size there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the °w orbital location this has forced some customers to either use a nd separate dish network brand dish or an aftermarket  dish aimed specifically at the °w orbital location on several satellite related web support forums customers have critically suggested that the new dish  wasnt nearly large enough and should have been – larger to properly deal with rain fade later dish network took the approach of splitting the us into two regions subscribers west of chicago use dish  antennas aimed at the °w °w and °w orbital locations referred to as the western arc subscribers east of chicago use dish  antennas aimed at the °w °w and °w oribital locations referred to as the eastern arc superdish  mounted on a roof during dish networks quest for capacity they had accumulated an array of satellite broadcasting technologies orbital locations and surplus capacity using nonmainstream technologies requiring larger dish sizes to capitalize on these broadcasting assets dish network started providing extensive ethnic programming from lowerpowered satellites broadcasting in the nondbs portion of the fss band dish network offers specialized equipment for these customers including larger dish antennascitation needed the superdish dish  and dish  systems receive dbs signals from both of the primary °w and °w locations °w for dish  as well

restrictions autohop is an extension of the dvrs prime time recording capability when enabled the feature records but hides commercials giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercialfree commercials cannot be skipped until  am eastern time and the viewer must choose to do this recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired news of autohop met with an immediate polarized response the feature was deemed a dream come true for consumers but for networks a nightmare undercutting the revenue model dish asserted that autohop would encourage its customers to sample new programming leslie moonves cbs chief executive asked rhetorically how he is to produce csi without the revenue stream of commercials news corporation refused to accept dish advertising for the device a forrester research analyst said the move demonstrated dishs desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the internet the controversy surrounding autohop contributed to one smallmarket station group hoak media corporation removing its  stations channels from the service on june   in negotiations hoak sought a  percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the autohop feature david shull dish senior vice president of programming accused hoak of effectively telling dishs customers that they must watch commercials disrespecting customer control over its services eight days later the two companies announced a distribution deal terms were not disclosed on june   dish chairman charlie ergen told the united states house subcommittee on communications and technology that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and fast food advertising the next day michael petricone of the consumer electronics association spoke to the subcommittee likening hopper to earlier time shifting devices he argued that hopper is legal and that autohop entices people to watch more television thereby expanding televisions market cnet was also forced by parent company cbs to disqualify the newest hopper with sling model from the ces best in show award for  because of its active litigation with the company ceo joe clayton said that dish was saddened that cnets staff is being denied its editorial independence because of cbs heavy handed tactics dish network directly attacked cbs for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website the ad proclaimed the dvr as being cnets best in show but with a footnote stating that cbs will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying adskipping technology—even censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name hopper best in show your vote is the only one that really matters work environmentedit one news report described dish as having an ergencreated culture of condescension and distrust in  the investment analysis and commentary site  wall st named dish network  among americas worst companies to work for an assessment based upon employee reviews at the employment website glassdoorcom such reviews should be interpreted with caution however as reviews at such sites sample few employees compared to the company as a whole and are weighted towards exemployees with keenlyfelt grievances current and ambivalent exemployees are less likely to post reviews it should be noted that every company is subject to the same caveats and dish was still found to be the worst long hours little vacation time and too much mandatory overtime were all common complaints dishs toxic corporate culture was cited as a key difficulty in its aborted acquisition of sprint nextel david hekman a business professor at the university of colorado said this will be a huge issue for the sprint employees if theyre subjected to this meaner culture it could be a real wakeup call hekman also stated if he gets revolt from the sprint employees  then there will be no synergy and then the merger would be viewed as a failure dish was aware of the problem after announcing its attempted merger with sprint it took out a fullpage ad in the kansas city star declaring its commitment to building a company that can deliver sustained growth over many years the ad also said we look forward to the opportunity to work together with sprints board and its management team to develop a combined vision remaining mindful of how it will benefit customers employees shareholders and of course the kansas city community as things move forward we will stay in touch dish has very rapid employee turnover the company does not report exactly how many people it fires each quarter dish refers to its quarterly culling of employees as talent upgrades michael neuman a former president of dish quit after only eight months he said that ergen acts unilaterally and pounds people in submission no president of dish has remained in the job for more than four years and many left after only one year for years dish employees were required to clock in at the beginning of their day using fingerprint scanners this measure angered many employees the fingerprint scanners were eventually removed badges were previously used to monitor the arrival and departure of employees the company started using fingerprints after charles ergen noticed some employees helping each other swipe their badges for them if an employee is late an email is sent to human resources human resources will in turn contact the employees manager possibly even charlie ergen himself multiple former employees said it was common for ergen to scream publicly at executives for arriving even minutes late dish does not allow its employees to work from home for several years dish policy required that any tip over  percent given on an expensed meal would be subtracted from the paycheck of the responsible employee dish does not provide employees with company credit cards telemarketing violationsedit dish network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered dish network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges in march  the federal trade commission charged dish network and two of its dealers with multiple violations of the ftcs telemarketing sales rule and the telephone consumer protection act of  amc networksedit see also amc networks § dish network carriage dispute on march   dish network announced that it would no longer carry the amc networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite providers distribution agreement with the company at the end of june  citing that amc networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels amc networks responded to dishs announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a  breach of contract lawsuit against dish network by former company parent rainbow medias voom hd networks in which it is seeking more than  billion in damages against dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract vooms highdefinition channels were carried on the provider from may   until may   when dish removed ten of vooms fifteen channels from its lineup the five remaining voom hd channels were removed from dish the day after however dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the amc networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms on may   dish network removed sundance channel from its channel lineup two weeks later on june   dish relocated amc we tv and ifc to higher channel positions with amc being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds amc moved from channel  to channel  for the sd feed and  for the hd feed we tv moved from channel  to channel  and ifc was moved from channel  to channel  the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with hdnet style and movieplex multiplex channel indieplex the move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a june  airing of an episode of mad men urging dish network customers to inform the company to keep the three amc networks channels on the satellite provider with dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels ratings on june   dish dropped the three amc networks properties replacing amc with hdnet movies ifc with hdnet which subsequently became axs tv two days later and we tv with style the move coincided with a new agreement between dish and att uverse on july   amc said in an emailed statement that it would stream over the internet the season premiere of breaking bad to dish customers dish subscribers can register online starting july  for the show which airs on july  we want to give dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season on october   amc networks announced a settlement was reached between them cablevision and dish in which dish was forced to pay up to  million in damages to cablevision for damages from removing voom owned channels off the dish lineup back in  and in return dish signed a new agreement to bring the amc networks owned channels back on the dish lineup with amc returning october  and the rest on november st also dish simultaneously brought back fuse and all  channels were moved from americas top  to  remarks on rural viewersedit during a conference call ergen stated after being asked about the removal of amc channels our customers are not looking at zombies in new york city they live in farms and ranches  we have data real data from our customers and for whatever reason our customers dont watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever ergen also said ive had satellite television for as long as satellite television has been around and theres never been one minute that i know of that anybody in my family or anybody whos came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels they have no clue about zombies in new york city marching around saying where is my amc soon after the call business insider blared the headline dish ceo says customers dont care about amc because they live on farms and ranches turner networksedit on october   during the early morning hours dish entered a dispute with time warners turner broadcasting system dish removed cnn hln cartoon networkadult swim boomerang trutv turner classic movies and cnn en español as the contract to carry those channels expired on october  tbs and tnt were not removed as they are carried under a different contract the channels were pulled without warning leaving many with questions dish replaced cnn and hln with msnbc replaced cartoon network and boomerang with nicktoons except for the west feed which was replaced by a message about the removal of the channels replaced turner classic movies with fxm and replaced trutv with esquire network during the duration of the dispute the dispute was settled and the turner network channels restored on november   hidden feesedit in january  thirteen states charged that echostar then the parent company of dish network had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers bank accounts for hidden fees the company settled the lawsuit paid  million and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with dish the shipping cost back in september of  was  as of june   the shipping cost is now  this fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed government subsidiesedit dish network received about  billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth dish network used the  federal communications act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the january  auction of wireless spectrum under the terms of that act designated entities qualify for a  percent discount on the market price of such licenses dish used small subsidiaries such as northstar wireless and snr wireless in order to qualify dish only paid  billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost  billion the difference would have been paid to the federal government the fec and the united states senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints litigationedit dish has been sued and countersued dozens of times in fact dish uses litigation as a profit center charlie ergen said i may be the only ceo who likes to go to depositions you can live in a bubble and you’re probably not going to get a disease but you can play in the mud and the dirt and you’re probably not going to get a disease either because you get immune to it you pick your poison and i think we choose to go play in the mud” in  dish admitted to using over  law firms over a tenyear period autohopedit on may   dish and the networks filed suit in federal court the dish case in manhattan and the networks cases in los angeles on may  us district judge laura taylor swain ruled the networks cases should not be filed in los angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to new york in july  preliminary judgement swain denied dishs request to set aside the issue of copyright violation ruling that dishs argument lacked specificity she also ruled that the case could be heard in los angeles thereby eliminating new york as a potential venue on november   the united states district court for the central district of california denied foxs motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because  ptat and autohop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract and  while qa copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract the harm from the copies was not irreparable but was compensable with money fox appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on july   the ninth circuit reviewed the district courts decision with a very deferential standard of review and affirmed it offthejob marijuana useedit dish fired a wheelchairbound quadriplegic man from his job as a telephone operator in  brandon coats for using medicalmarijuana during offwork hours coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms his paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash coats failed a random drug test coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee coats suit relied under a colorado law called the lawful offduty activities statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time the trial court and colorado court of appeals ruled in coats v dish network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law the trial court ruled that coats should have to pay dishs legal fees the appeals court overturned this ruling voomedit in april  rainbow media and dish network entered into a year affiliation agreement whereby echostar’s dish network obtained the right to distribute the voom channels until  and agreed that it would pay rainbow media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement the subscription fees started at  per subscriber in the first year of the agreement and were to increase to  per subscriber by the year  in a separate agreement echostar’s dish obtained a  ownership interest in rainbow media the business unit that contained the voom hd channels and rainbow agreed to invest  million into the voom service each year for the first five years of the agreement as a result echostars dish network announced that they would be adding ten of vooms original  channels to their lineup starting may  the remaining channels were added on february   in january  echostars dish network abandoned the affiliation agreement claiming that voom had failed to invest  million in the service during  although cablevision and rainbow provided dish network with the financial statements documenting their compliance dish network proceeded to remove ten of the channels from their lineup on may   with the remaining five removed the next day leaving coverage limited to cablevisions systems in new york new jersey connecticut and parts of pennsylvania cablevision and rainbow sued dish network for breach of contract and sought more than  billion in damages citing this drop in carriage and the ensuing lengthy litigation cablevision announced on december  that the voom hd suite would be discontinued as of january   to be replaced by other hd programming ultimately the channels ceased operations on january  and were replaced by multiplexed hd content from premium providers following the discovery process the court granted vooms motion for sanctions the new york state supreme court found that echostars dish network systematically destroyed evidence in the case and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by echostar demonstrated that echostar knew all along that there was no breachand would prove voom’s case” the judge also stated that he would tell jurors that dish network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to voom’s case according to sanford c bernstein analyst craig moffett in a recent wall street journal article cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party in this case the judge told the jury that echostar failed to preserve certain evidence he barred dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages additionally the court stated in its november   ruling “in conclusion the court notes echostar’s pattern of egregious conduct and questionable – and at times blatantly improper – litigation tactics echostar’s spoliation in this action and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court similarly egregious is echostar’s last minute finagling with expert reports believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture” the trial commenced on september   in the new york state supreme court during the summer of  financial analysts who cover dish urged the company to settle the lawsuit in advance of the trial as “the odds would…appear to be heavily in cablevision’samc’s favor” dish chose to settle the terms of the settlement required dish to pay  million for spectrum licenses covering  megahertz and capable of serving  million people foxedit main article fox broadcasting co v dish network llc on december   dish network dropped fox news channel and fox business network a failed first attempt to reach a deal on the th of the same month resulted in the blackout the two parties blamed each other dish said fox tried to unfairly tie in a sister channel and charge unreasonable rates fox pointed out the recent pattern dish had created with other networks a deal was finally reached on january   with undisclosed terms tivo patent lawsuitedit main article tivo inc v echostar corp on june   satellite service provider echostar was found by marshall texas federal district court judge david folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of tivos technology and was required to pay the dvr pioneer  million plus interest on may   dish network corporation and echostar corporation agreed to pay tivo inc  million to settle a dispute over the use of some of tivo’s technology this lawsuit took more than ten years to resolve one of the judges involved said that the conduct of dishs lawyers didnt “even meet lawschool student behavior” and “presented the saddest day i have seen in my many years in court” bartlit beck herman palenchar  scottedit dish sued its own law firm bartlit beck herman palenchar  scott of chicago for malpractice the firm countersued and won a  million judgement against dish a panel from the american arbitration association said that dishs allegations were patently false and egregious related party transactionsedit in  dish invested  in a technology startup yottabyte ventures llc in which christoper ergen the son of ceo charlie ergen has  percent equity yottabytes develops mobile video applications at the end of  dish held  of that companys equity in  dish paid  to an online marketing company that chase ergen another son of charlie ergen owns  of as part of a reseller agreement dish paid another firm owned by chase ergen  during  and  candy ergen charlie ergens wife is paid between  to  per year in consulting fees other unnamed children of ergen received about  in  and  these transactions were criticized by analysts lev janashvili managing director at gmi ratings which tracks governance accounting and other risks in publicly traded companies said these are things to be concerned about because they raise reasonable questions about conflicts of interest and the overall integrity of governance at the company janashvili also said the investment in yottabytes ventures llc is a classic example of a related party transaction that warrants a closer scrutiny of the companys governance practices especially because this transaction is part of a broader pattern of behaviors that run counter to the interests of shareholders dish is a controlled company whose majority shareholder can insulate himself from the opinions of other investors investor relationsedit dish has reportedly been criticized for treating analysts and major shareholders poorly craig moffett senior analyst of us telecommunications us cable and satellite broadcasting at sanford c bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how dish does business ergen told him “we’re too busy creating value around here to sit down and talk about it thanks but no thanks” chris marangi a money manager for gamco investors which held about  millions shares in dish said that the company is very uncooperative he says that despite traveling to denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with ergen or any other dish senior manager “they’re probably the least transparent company of any i’ve ever dealt with dish sends out press releases on its earnings deliberately late enough to be of little or no use to analysts and investors whom are then forced to sort through complicated filings submitted to the securities and exchange commission hearst

satellite broadcasting joint venture of news corporation and mci worldcom called askyb for american sky broadcasting named after news corps bskyb service in britain the two companies had nearly merged which called for dish network being renamed sky before it was called off due to charlie ergens clashes with news corp executives with this purchase echostar obtained  of the  transponder licenses in the ° west orbital slot more than doubling existing continental united states broadcasting capacity at a value of  million some of the other assets were picked up by rival primestar which was sold to

nextel or clearwire in  dish made a bid for both companies ceo charles ergen plans on adding wireless internet and mobile video services that can compete with netflix and cable companies about the new markets ergen said given the assets weve been accumulating i dont think its hard to see were moving in a different direction from simply paytv which is a market thats becoming increasingly saturated dish network put its blockbuster acquisition to work by making available dish movie pack for dish network subscribers and sling tv for nondish network subscribers blockbuster also has agreements that

anatel they await the authorization of the application technical informationedit satellite dishesedit dish network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by sanminasci corporation to echostar specifications prior to the december  merger of sci systems and sanmina dish network receivers were produced at factories in huntsville alabama and fountain colorado currentlywhen receiver assembly takes place in guadalajara mexico and india dish hd newest version used with the hopper and joey system earlier satellite dishesedit dish networks first satellite antenna was simply called the dish network dish it was retroactively named the dish  when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming dish  systems it uses one lnb to obtain signals from the °w orbital location and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional highdefinition or ethnic programming from either the °w or °w orbital locations the °w slot is one of two primary orbital locations the other being °w that provide core services after echostar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between askyb and mci worldcom it had more than doubled its capacity by adding  transponders at the °w orbital location since echostar also owned the adjacent °w orbital location it developed the dish  to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative duallnb assembly although the new inch dish  was slightly larger than the thencurrent inch dish  and directv dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from echostars two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical channel capacity the dish  as a result provided very large capacity for localintolocal service nationwide programming and business services in order to migrate existing customers to dish  dish network provides valueadded channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the dish  and newer systems some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are h boomerang science planet green pbs kids sprout and comedy central higher capacity satellite dishesedit dish  with turbohd branding mounted on a residential apartment railing in spite of all this capacity echostar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide highdefinition television and conceived the dish  system to receive signals from °w °w and °w orbital locations originally dish network highdefinition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes currently dish network subscribers can receive nationwide hdtv channels using the °w orbital location or °w orbital location because of issues with low signal strength the older model dish  has been replaced with the dish  the  has a  larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated lnb for easier installation the dish  is  in  mm in diameter even with the larger size there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the °w orbital location this has forced some customers to either use a nd separate dish network brand dish or an aftermarket  dish aimed specifically at the °w orbital location on several satellite related web support forums customers have critically suggested that the new dish  wasnt nearly large enough and should have been – larger to properly deal with rain fade later dish network took the approach of splitting the us into two regions subscribers west of chicago use dish  antennas aimed at the °w °w and °w orbital locations referred to as the western arc subscribers east of chicago use dish  antennas aimed at the °w °w and °w oribital locations referred to as the eastern arc superdish  mounted on a roof during dish networks quest for capacity they had accumulated an array of satellite broadcasting technologies orbital locations and surplus capacity using nonmainstream technologies requiring larger dish sizes to capitalize on these broadcasting assets dish network started providing extensive ethnic programming from lowerpowered satellites broadcasting in the nondbs portion of the fss band dish network offers specialized equipment for these customers including larger dish antennascitation needed the superdish dish  and dish  systems receive dbs signals from both of the primary °w and °w locations °w for dish  as well as lowerpowered fss signals from either °w °w or °w the dish  and  systems receive circularly polarized signals in the nondbs portion of the fss band—the only american satellite television service to do so broadcast technologyedit while for years dish network has used standard mpeg for broadcasting the addition of bandwidthintensive hdtv in a limitedbandwidth world has called for a change to an

only satellite criticisms and controversiesedit main article criticism of dish network since the early s dish network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers most notably when the hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without commercials major networks sued dish network autohopedit dish networks hopper digital video recorder announced in january  led to controversy over a feature called autohop which allows viewers to watch some programming without commercials subject to time restrictions autohop is an extension of the dvrs prime time recording capability when enabled the feature records but hides commercials giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercialfree commercials cannot be skipped until  am eastern time and the viewer must choose to do this recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired news of autohop met with an immediate polarized response the feature was deemed a dream come true for consumers but for networks a nightmare undercutting the revenue model dish asserted that autohop would encourage its customers to sample new programming leslie moonves cbs chief executive asked rhetorically how he is to produce csi without the revenue stream of commercials news corporation refused to accept dish advertising for the device a forrester research analyst said the move demonstrated dishs desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the internet the controversy surrounding autohop contributed to one smallmarket station group hoak media corporation removing its  stations channels from the service on june   in negotiations hoak sought a  percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the autohop feature david shull dish senior vice president of programming accused hoak of effectively telling dishs customers that they must watch commercials disrespecting customer control over its services eight days later the two companies announced a distribution deal terms were not disclosed on june   dish chairman charlie ergen told the united states house subcommittee on communications and technology that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and fast food advertising the next day michael petricone of the consumer electronics association spoke to the subcommittee likening hopper to earlier time shifting devices he argued that hopper is legal and that autohop entices people to watch more television thereby expanding televisions market cnet was also forced by parent company cbs to disqualify the newest hopper with sling model from the ces best in show award for  because of its active litigation with the company ceo joe clayton said that dish was saddened that cnets staff is being denied its editorial independence because of cbs heavy handed tactics dish network directly attacked cbs for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website the ad proclaimed the dvr as being cnets best in show but with a footnote stating that cbs will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying adskipping technology—even censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name hopper best in show your vote is the only one that really matters work environmentedit one news report described dish as having an ergencreated culture of condescension and distrust in  the investment analysis and commentary site  wall st named dish network  among americas worst companies to work for an assessment based upon employee reviews at the employment website glassdoorcom such reviews should be interpreted with caution however as reviews at such sites sample few employees compared to the company as a whole and are weighted towards exemployees with keenlyfelt grievances current and ambivalent exemployees are less likely to post reviews it should be noted that every company is subject to the same caveats and dish was still found to be the worst long hours little vacation time and too much mandatory overtime were all common complaints dishs toxic corporate culture was cited as a key difficulty in its aborted acquisition of sprint nextel david hekman a business professor at the university of colorado said this will be a huge issue for the sprint employees if theyre subjected to this meaner culture it could be a real wakeup call hekman also stated if he gets revolt from the sprint employees  then there will be no synergy and then the merger would be viewed as a failure dish was aware of the problem after announcing its attempted merger with sprint it took out a fullpage ad in the kansas city star declaring its commitment to building a company that can deliver sustained growth over many years the ad also said we look forward to the opportunity to work together with sprints board and its management team to develop a combined vision remaining mindful of how it will benefit customers employees shareholders and of course the kansas city community as things move forward we will stay in touch dish has very rapid employee turnover the company does not report exactly how many people it fires each quarter dish refers to its quarterly culling of employees as talent upgrades michael neuman a former president of dish quit after only eight months he said that ergen acts unilaterally and pounds people in submission no president of dish has remained in the job for more than four years and many left after only one year for years dish employees were required to clock in at the beginning of their day using fingerprint scanners this measure angered many employees the fingerprint scanners were eventually removed badges were previously used to monitor the arrival and departure of employees the company started using fingerprints after charles ergen noticed some employees helping each other swipe their badges for them if an employee is late an email is sent to human resources human resources will in turn contact the employees manager possibly even charlie ergen himself multiple former employees said it was common for ergen to scream publicly at executives for arriving even minutes late dish does not allow its employees to work from home for several years dish policy required that any tip over  percent given on an expensed meal would be subtracted from the paycheck of the responsible employee dish does not provide employees with company credit cards telemarketing violationsedit dish network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered dish network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges in march  the federal trade commission charged dish network and two of its dealers with multiple violations of the ftcs telemarketing sales rule and the telephone consumer protection act of  amc networksedit see also amc networks § dish network carriage dispute on march   dish network announced that it would no longer carry the amc networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite providers distribution agreement with the company at the end of june  citing that amc networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels amc networks responded to dishs announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a  breach of contract lawsuit against dish network by former company parent rainbow medias voom hd networks in which it is seeking more than  billion in damages against dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract vooms highdefinition channels were carried on the provider from may   until may   when dish removed ten of vooms fifteen channels from its lineup the five remaining voom hd channels were removed from dish the day after however dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the amc networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms on may   dish network removed sundance channel from its channel lineup two weeks later on june   dish relocated amc we tv and ifc to higher channel positions with amc being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds amc moved from channel  to channel  for the sd feed and  for the hd feed we tv moved from channel  to channel  and ifc was moved from channel  to channel  the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with hdnet style and movieplex multiplex channel indieplex the move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a june  airing of an episode of mad men urging dish network customers to inform the company to keep the three amc networks channels on the satellite provider with dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels ratings on june   dish dropped the three amc networks properties replacing amc with hdnet movies ifc with hdnet which subsequently became axs tv two days later and we tv with style the move coincided with a new agreement between dish and att uverse on july   amc said in an emailed statement that it would stream over the internet the season premiere of breaking bad to dish customers dish subscribers can register online starting july  for the show which airs on july  we want to give dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season on october   amc networks announced a settlement was reached between them cablevision and dish in which dish was forced to pay up to  million in damages to cablevision for damages from removing voom owned channels off the dish lineup back in  and in return dish signed a new agreement to bring the amc networks owned channels back on the dish lineup with amc returning october  and the rest on november st also dish simultaneously brought back fuse and all  channels were moved from americas top  to  remarks on rural viewersedit during a conference call ergen stated after being asked about the removal of amc channels our customers are not looking at zombies in new york city they live in farms and ranches  we have data real data from our customers and for whatever reason our customers dont watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever ergen also said ive had satellite television for as long as satellite television has been around and theres never been one minute that i know of that anybody in my family or anybody whos came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels they have no clue about zombies in new york city marching around saying where is my amc soon after the call business insider blared the headline dish ceo says customers dont care about amc because they live on farms and ranches turner networksedit on october   during the early morning hours dish entered a dispute with time warners turner broadcasting system dish removed cnn hln cartoon networkadult swim boomerang trutv turner classic movies and cnn en español as the contract to carry those channels expired on october  tbs and tnt were not removed as they are carried under a different contract the channels were pulled without warning leaving many with questions dish replaced cnn and hln with msnbc replaced cartoon network and boomerang with nicktoons except for the west feed which was replaced by a message about the removal of the channels replaced turner classic movies with fxm and replaced trutv with esquire network during the duration of the dispute the dispute was settled and the turner network channels restored on november   hidden feesedit in january  thirteen states charged that echostar then the parent company of dish network had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers bank accounts for hidden fees the company settled the lawsuit paid  million and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with dish the shipping cost back in september of  was  as of june   the shipping cost is now  this fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed government subsidiesedit dish network received about  billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth dish network used the  federal communications act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the january  auction of wireless spectrum under the terms of that act designated entities qualify for a  percent discount on the market price of such licenses dish used small subsidiaries such as northstar wireless and snr wireless in order to qualify dish only paid  billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost  billion the difference would have been paid to the federal government the fec and the united states senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints litigationedit dish has been sued and countersued dozens of times in fact dish uses litigation as a profit center charlie ergen said i may be the only ceo who likes to go to depositions you can live in a bubble and you’re probably not going to get a disease but you can play in the mud and the dirt and you’re probably not going to get a disease either because you get immune to it you pick your poison and i think we choose to go play in the mud” in  dish admitted to using over  law firms over a tenyear period autohopedit on may   dish and the networks filed suit in federal court the dish case in manhattan and the networks cases in los angeles on may  us district judge laura taylor swain ruled the networks cases should not be filed in los angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to new york in july  preliminary judgement swain denied dishs request to set aside the issue of copyright violation ruling that dishs argument lacked specificity she also ruled that the case could be heard in los angeles thereby eliminating new york as a potential venue on november   the united states district court for the central district of california denied foxs motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because  ptat and autohop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract and  while qa copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract the harm from the copies was not irreparable but was compensable with money fox appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on july   the ninth circuit reviewed the district courts decision with a very deferential standard of review and affirmed it offthejob marijuana useedit dish fired a wheelchairbound quadriplegic man from his job as a telephone operator in  brandon coats for using medicalmarijuana during offwork hours coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms his paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash coats failed a random drug test coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee coats suit relied under a colorado law called the lawful offduty activities statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time the trial court and colorado court of appeals ruled in coats v dish network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law the trial court ruled that coats should have to pay dishs legal fees the appeals court overturned this ruling voomedit in april  rainbow media and dish network entered into a year affiliation agreement whereby echostar’s dish network obtained the right to distribute the voom channels until  and agreed that it would pay rainbow media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement the subscription fees started at  per subscriber in the first year of the agreement and were to increase to  per subscriber by the year  in a separate agreement echostar’s dish obtained a  ownership interest in rainbow media the business unit that contained the voom hd channels and rainbow agreed to invest  million into the voom service each year for the first five years of the agreement as a result echostars dish network announced that they would be adding ten of vooms original  channels to their lineup starting may  the remaining channels were added on february   in january  echostars dish network abandoned the affiliation agreement claiming that voom had failed to invest  million in the service during  although cablevision and rainbow provided dish network with the financial statements documenting their compliance dish network proceeded to remove ten of the channels from their lineup on may   with the remaining five removed the next day leaving coverage limited to cablevisions systems in new york new jersey connecticut and parts of pennsylvania cablevision and rainbow sued dish network for breach of contract and sought more than  billion in damages citing this drop in carriage and the ensuing lengthy litigation cablevision announced on december  that the voom hd suite would be discontinued as of january   to be replaced by other hd programming ultimately the channels ceased operations on january  and were replaced by multiplexed hd content from premium providers following the discovery process the court granted vooms motion for sanctions the new york state supreme court found that echostars dish network systematically destroyed evidence in the case and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by echostar demonstrated that echostar knew all along that there was no breachand would prove voom’s case” the judge also stated that he would tell jurors that dish network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to voom’s case according to sanford c bernstein analyst craig moffett in a recent wall street journal article cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party in this case the judge told the jury that echostar failed to preserve certain evidence he barred dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages additionally the court stated in its november   ruling “in conclusion the court notes echostar’s pattern of egregious conduct and questionable – and at times blatantly improper – litigation tactics echostar’s spoliation in this action and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court similarly egregious is echostar’s last minute finagling with expert reports believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture” the trial commenced on september   in the new york state supreme court during the summer of  financial analysts who cover dish urged the company to settle the lawsuit in advance of the trial as “the odds would…appear to be heavily in cablevision’samc’s favor” dish chose to settle the terms of the settlement required dish to pay  million for spectrum licenses covering  megahertz and capable of serving  million people foxedit main article fox broadcasting co v dish network llc on december   dish network dropped fox news channel and fox business network a failed first attempt to reach a deal on the th of the same month resulted in the blackout the two parties blamed each other dish said fox tried to unfairly tie in a sister channel and charge unreasonable rates fox pointed out the recent pattern dish had created with other networks a deal was finally reached on january   with undisclosed terms tivo patent lawsuitedit main article tivo inc v echostar corp on june   satellite service provider echostar was found by marshall texas federal district court judge david folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of tivos technology and was required to pay the dvr pioneer  million plus interest on may   dish network corporation and echostar corporation agreed to pay tivo inc  million to settle a dispute over the use of some of tivo’s technology this lawsuit took more than ten years to resolve one of the judges involved said that the conduct of dishs lawyers didnt “even meet lawschool student behavior” and “presented the saddest day i have seen in my many years in court” bartlit beck herman palenchar  scottedit dish sued its own law firm bartlit beck herman palenchar  scott of chicago for malpractice the firm countersued and won a  million judgement against dish a panel from the american arbitration association said that dishs allegations were patently false and egregious related party transactionsedit in  dish invested  in a technology startup yottabyte ventures llc in which christoper ergen the son of ceo charlie ergen has  percent equity yottabytes

reseller agreement dish paid another firm owned by chase ergen  during  and  candy ergen charlie ergens wife is paid between  to  per year in consulting fees other unnamed children of ergen received about  in  and  these transactions were criticized by analysts lev janashvili managing director at gmi ratings which tracks governance accounting and other risks in publicly traded companies said these are things to be concerned about because they raise reasonable questions about conflicts of interest and the overall integrity of governance at the company janashvili also said the investment in yottabytes ventures llc is a classic example of a related party transaction that warrants a closer scrutiny of the companys governance practices especially because this transaction is part of a broader pattern of behaviors that run counter to the interests of shareholders dish is a controlled company whose majority shareholder can insulate himself from the opinions of other investors investor relationsedit dish has reportedly been criticized for treating analysts and major shareholders poorly craig moffett senior analyst of us telecommunications us cable and satellite broadcasting at sanford c bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how dish does business ergen told him “we’re too busy creating value around here to sit down and talk about it thanks but no thanks” chris marangi a money manager for gamco investors which held about  millions shares in dish said that the company is very uncooperative he says that despite traveling to denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with ergen or any other dish senior manager “they’re probably the least transparent company of any i’ve ever dealt with dish sends out press releases on its earnings

satellite dishesedit dish network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by sanminasci corporation to echostar specifications prior to the december  merger of sci systems and sanmina dish network receivers were produced at factories in huntsville alabama and fountain colorado currentlywhen receiver assembly takes place in guadalajara mexico and india dish hd newest version used with the hopper and joey system earlier satellite dishesedit dish networks first satellite antenna was simply called the dish network dish it was retroactively named the dish  when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming dish  systems it uses one lnb to obtain signals from the °w orbital location and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional highdefinition or ethnic programming from either the °w or °w orbital locations the °w slot is one of two primary orbital locations the other being °w that provide core services after echostar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between askyb and mci worldcom it had more than doubled its capacity by adding  transponders at the °w orbital location since echostar also owned the adjacent °w orbital location it developed the dish  to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative duallnb assembly although the new inch dish  was slightly larger than the thencurrent inch dish  and directv dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from echostars two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical channel capacity the dish  as a result provided very large capacity for localintolocal service nationwide

hdtv channels using the °w orbital location or °w orbital location because of issues with low signal strength the older model dish  has been replaced with the dish  the  has a  larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated lnb for easier installation the dish  is  in  mm in diameter even with the larger size there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the °w orbital location this has forced some customers to either use a nd separate dish network brand dish or an aftermarket  dish aimed specifically at the °w orbital location on several satellite

criticisms and controversiesedit main article criticism of dish network since the early s dish network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers most notably when the hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without commercials major networks sued dish network autohopedit dish networks hopper digital video recorder announced in january  led to controversy over a feature called autohop which allows viewers to watch some programming without commercials subject to time restrictions autohop is an extension of the dvrs prime time recording capability when enabled the feature records but hides commercials giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercialfree commercials cannot be skipped until  am eastern time and the viewer must choose to do this recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired news of autohop met with an immediate polarized response the feature was deemed a dream come true for consumers but for networks a nightmare undercutting the revenue model dish asserted that autohop would encourage its customers to sample new programming leslie moonves cbs chief executive asked rhetorically how he is to produce csi without the revenue stream of commercials news corporation refused to accept dish advertising for the device a forrester research analyst said the move demonstrated dishs desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the internet the controversy surrounding autohop contributed to one smallmarket station group hoak media corporation removing its  stations channels from the service on june   in negotiations hoak sought a  percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the autohop feature david shull dish senior vice president of programming accused hoak of effectively telling dishs customers that they must watch commercials disrespecting customer control over its services eight days later the two companies announced a distribution deal terms were not disclosed on june   dish chairman charlie ergen told the united states house subcommittee on communications and technology that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and fast food advertising the next day michael petricone of the consumer electronics association spoke to the subcommittee likening hopper to earlier time shifting devices he argued that hopper is legal and that autohop entices people to watch more television thereby expanding televisions market cnet was also forced by parent company cbs to disqualify the newest hopper with sling model from the ces best in show award for  because of its active litigation with the company ceo joe clayton said that dish was saddened that cnets staff is being denied its editorial independence because of cbs heavy handed tactics dish network directly attacked cbs for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website the ad proclaimed the dvr as being cnets best in show but with a footnote stating that cbs will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying adskipping technology—even censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name hopper best in show your vote is the only one that really matters work environmentedit one news report described dish as having an ergencreated culture of condescension and distrust in  the investment analysis and commentary site  wall st named dish network  among americas worst companies to work for an assessment based upon employee reviews at the employment website glassdoorcom such reviews should be interpreted with caution however as reviews at such sites sample few employees compared to the company as a whole and are weighted towards exemployees with keenlyfelt grievances current and ambivalent exemployees are less likely to post reviews it should be noted that every company is subject to the same caveats and dish was still found to be the worst long hours little vacation time and too much mandatory overtime were all common complaints dishs toxic corporate culture was cited as a key difficulty in its aborted acquisition of sprint nextel david hekman a business professor at the university of colorado said this will be a huge issue for the sprint employees if theyre subjected to this meaner culture it could be a real wakeup call hekman also stated if he gets revolt from the sprint employees  then there will be no synergy and then the merger would be viewed as a failure dish was aware of the problem after announcing its attempted merger with sprint it took out a fullpage ad in the kansas city star declaring its commitment to building a company that can deliver sustained growth over many years the ad also said we look forward to the opportunity to work together with sprints board and its management team to develop a combined vision remaining mindful of how it will benefit customers employees shareholders and of course the kansas city community as things move forward we will stay in touch dish has very rapid employee turnover the company does not report exactly how many people it fires each quarter dish refers to its quarterly culling of employees as talent upgrades michael neuman a former president of dish quit after only eight months he said that ergen acts unilaterally and pounds people in submission no president of dish has remained in the job for more than four years and many left after only one year for years dish employees were required to clock in at the beginning of their day using fingerprint scanners this measure angered many employees the fingerprint scanners were eventually removed badges were previously used to monitor the arrival and departure of employees the company started using fingerprints after charles ergen noticed some employees helping each other swipe their badges for them if an employee is late an email is sent to human resources human resources will in turn contact the employees manager possibly even charlie ergen himself multiple former employees said it was common for ergen to scream publicly at executives for arriving even minutes late dish does not allow its employees to work from home for several years dish policy required that any tip over  percent given on an expensed meal would be subtracted from the paycheck of the responsible employee dish does not provide employees with company credit cards telemarketing violationsedit dish network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered dish network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges in march  the federal trade commission charged dish network and two of its dealers with multiple violations of the ftcs telemarketing sales rule and the telephone consumer protection act of  amc networksedit see also amc networks § dish network carriage dispute on march   dish network announced that it would no longer carry the amc networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite providers distribution agreement with the company at the end of june  citing that amc networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels amc networks responded to dishs announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a  breach of contract lawsuit against dish network by former company parent rainbow medias voom hd networks in which it is seeking more than  billion in damages against dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract vooms highdefinition channels were carried on the provider from may   until may   when dish removed ten of vooms fifteen channels from its lineup the five remaining voom hd channels were removed from dish the day after however dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the amc networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms on may   dish network removed sundance channel from its channel lineup two weeks later on june   dish relocated amc we tv and ifc to higher channel positions with amc being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds amc moved from channel  to channel  for the sd feed and  for the hd feed we tv moved from channel  to channel  and ifc was moved from channel  to channel  the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with hdnet style and movieplex multiplex channel indieplex the move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a june  airing of an episode of mad men urging dish network customers to inform the company to keep the three amc networks channels on the satellite provider with dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels ratings on june   dish dropped the three amc networks properties replacing amc with hdnet movies ifc with hdnet which subsequently became axs tv two days later and we tv with style the move coincided with a new agreement between dish and att uverse on july   amc said in an emailed statement that it would stream over the internet the season premiere of breaking bad to dish customers dish subscribers can register online starting july  for the show which airs on july  we want to give dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season on october   amc networks announced a settlement was reached between them cablevision and dish in which dish was forced to pay up to  million in damages to cablevision for damages from removing voom owned channels off the dish lineup back in  and in return dish signed a new agreement to bring the amc networks owned channels back on the dish lineup with amc returning october  and the rest on november st also dish simultaneously brought back fuse and all  channels were moved from americas top  to  remarks on rural viewersedit during a conference call ergen stated after being asked about the removal of amc channels our customers are not looking at zombies in new york city they live in farms and ranches  we have data real data from our customers and for whatever reason our customers dont watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever ergen also said ive had satellite television for as long as satellite television has been around and theres never been one minute that i know of that anybody in my family or anybody whos came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels they have no clue about zombies in new york city marching around saying where is my amc soon after the call business insider blared the headline dish ceo says customers dont care about amc because they live on farms and ranches turner networksedit on october   during the early morning hours dish entered a dispute with time warners turner broadcasting system dish removed cnn hln cartoon networkadult swim boomerang trutv turner classic movies and cnn en español as the contract to carry those channels expired on october  tbs and tnt were not removed as they are carried under a different contract the channels were pulled without warning leaving many with questions dish replaced cnn and hln with msnbc replaced cartoon network and boomerang with nicktoons except for the west feed which was replaced by a message about the removal of the channels replaced turner classic movies with fxm and replaced trutv with esquire network during the duration of the dispute the dispute was settled and the turner network channels restored on november   hidden feesedit in january  thirteen states charged that echostar then the parent company of dish network had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers bank accounts for hidden fees the company settled the lawsuit paid  million and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with dish the shipping cost back in september of  was  as of june   the shipping cost is now  this fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed government subsidiesedit dish network received about  billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth dish network used the  federal communications act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the january  auction of wireless spectrum under the terms of that act designated entities qualify for a  percent discount on the market price of such licenses dish used small subsidiaries such as northstar wireless and snr wireless in order to qualify dish only paid  billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost  billion the difference would have been paid to the federal government the fec and the united states senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints litigationedit dish has been sued and countersued dozens of times in fact dish uses litigation as a profit center charlie ergen said i may be the only ceo who likes to go to depositions you can live in a bubble and you’re probably not going to get a disease but you can play in the mud and the dirt and you’re probably not going to get a disease either because you get immune to it you pick your poison and i think we choose to go play in the mud” in  dish admitted to using over  law firms over a tenyear period autohopedit on may   dish and the networks filed suit in federal court the dish case in manhattan and the networks cases in los angeles on may  us district judge laura taylor swain ruled the networks cases should not be filed in los angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to new york in july  preliminary judgement swain denied dishs request to set aside the issue of copyright violation ruling that dishs argument lacked specificity she also ruled that the case could be heard in los angeles thereby eliminating new york as a potential venue on november   the united states district court for the central district of california denied foxs motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because  ptat and autohop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract and  while qa copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract the harm from the copies was not irreparable but was compensable with money fox appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on july   the ninth circuit reviewed the district courts decision with a very deferential standard of review and affirmed it offthejob marijuana useedit dish fired a wheelchairbound quadriplegic man from his job as a telephone operator in  brandon coats for using medicalmarijuana during offwork hours coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms his paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash coats failed a random drug test coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee coats suit relied under a colorado law called the lawful offduty activities statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time the trial court and colorado court of appeals ruled in coats v dish network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law the trial court ruled that coats should have to pay dishs legal fees the appeals court overturned this ruling voomedit in april  rainbow media and dish network entered into a year affiliation agreement whereby echostar’s dish network obtained the right to distribute the voom channels until  and agreed that it would pay rainbow media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement the subscription fees started at  per subscriber in the first year of the agreement and were to increase to  per subscriber by the year  in a separate agreement echostar’s dish obtained a  ownership interest in rainbow media the business unit that contained the voom hd channels and rainbow agreed to invest  million into the voom service each year for the first five years of the agreement as a result echostars dish network announced that they would be adding ten of vooms original  channels to their lineup starting may  the remaining channels were added on february   in january  echostars dish network abandoned the affiliation agreement claiming that voom had failed to invest  million in the service during  although cablevision and rainbow provided dish network with the financial statements documenting their compliance dish network proceeded to remove ten of the channels from their lineup on may   with the remaining five removed the next day leaving coverage limited to cablevisions systems in new york new jersey connecticut and parts of pennsylvania cablevision and rainbow sued dish network for breach of contract and sought more than  billion in damages citing this drop in carriage and the ensuing lengthy litigation cablevision announced on december  that the voom hd suite would be discontinued as of january   to be replaced by other hd programming ultimately the channels ceased operations on january  and were replaced by multiplexed hd content from premium providers following the discovery process the court granted vooms motion for sanctions the new york state supreme court found that echostars dish network systematically destroyed evidence in the case and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by echostar demonstrated that echostar knew all along that there was no breachand would prove voom’s case” the judge also stated that he would tell jurors that dish network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to voom’s case according to sanford c bernstein analyst craig moffett in a recent wall street journal article cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party in this case the judge told the jury that echostar failed to preserve certain evidence he barred dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages additionally the court stated in its november   ruling “in conclusion the court notes echostar’s pattern of egregious conduct and questionable – and at times blatantly improper – litigation tactics echostar’s spoliation in this action and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court similarly egregious is echostar’s last minute finagling with expert reports believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture” the trial commenced on september   in the new york state supreme court during the summer of  financial analysts who cover dish urged the company to settle the lawsuit in advance of the trial as “the odds would…appear to be heavily in cablevision’samc’s favor” dish chose to settle the terms of the settlement required dish to pay  million for spectrum licenses covering  megahertz and capable of serving  million people foxedit main article fox broadcasting co v dish network llc on december   dish network dropped fox news channel and fox business network a failed first attempt to reach a deal on the th of the same month resulted in the blackout the two parties blamed each other dish said fox tried to unfairly tie in a

injunction against using some of tivos technology and was required to pay the dvr pioneer  million plus interest on may   dish network corporation and echostar corporation agreed to pay tivo inc  million to settle a dispute over the use of some of tivo’s technology this lawsuit took more than ten years to resolve one of the judges involved said that the conduct of dishs lawyers didnt “even

about  in  and  these transactions were criticized by analysts lev janashvili managing director at gmi ratings which tracks governance accounting and other risks in publicly traded companies said these are things to be concerned about because they raise reasonable questions about conflicts of interest and the overall integrity of governance at the company janashvili also said the investment in yottabytes ventures llc is a classic example of a related party transaction that warrants a closer scrutiny of the companys governance practices especially because this transaction is part of a broader pattern of behaviors that run counter to the interests of shareholders dish is a controlled company whose majority shareholder can insulate himself from the opinions of other investors investor relationsedit dish has reportedly been criticized for treating analysts and major shareholders poorly craig moffett senior analyst of us telecommunications us cable and satellite broadcasting at sanford c bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how dish does business ergen told him “we’re too busy creating value around here to sit down and talk about it thanks but no thanks” chris marangi a money manager for gamco investors which held about  millions shares in dish said that the company is very uncooperative he says that despite traveling to denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with ergen or any other dish senior manager “they’re probably the least transparent company of any i’ve ever dealt with dish sends out press releases on its earnings

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a

or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
