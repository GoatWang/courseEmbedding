empress splendor tree this is the fastest growing hardwood tree in the world guinness book of world records reaching maturity in just  years the empress is a member of the paulownia family a sacred tree of the orient long revered for its fast growth and quality wood in japan it is the emblem of the prime minister the paulownia is native to north america but is not as well known here the empress splendor is a noninvasive hybrid species that can grow in most the united states and canada where it’s primary use is lumber empress splendor trees are not genetically modified but are bred using conventional methods used by farmers for thousands of years they do not respond well to chemical products preferring instead organic farming methods and the use of natural fertilizers such as chicken manure the empress tree is ‘wet’ wood which makes it naturally fire and insect resistant empress splendor trees absorb more carbon dioxide than any other tree planting  trees will offset the carbon emissions of an average north american for  years record breaking growth the empress splendor is the fastest growing hardwood tree in the world growing up to  feet in the first year and reaching maturity in just  years this tree is just four years old part of the ecosystem the flowers of the empress tree are rich in nectar attracting honey bees the large widely spaced leaves provide the plants below both light and shelter and the tree revitalizes the soil for other plants tree regrows  times when you cut down an empress splendor tree it immediately regrows from the root an empress tree will regenerate up to  times continuing to absorb carbon for  years from planting to harvest in  years world tree only works with qualified farmers who already have experience successfully growing empress trees empress trees grow best  in places with summer temperatures of °f °c and above for at least  months a year and an altitude of less than  feet the trees typically grow  feet in the first year and reach maturity in  years the trees are naturally resistant to fire and insects so are extremely hardy none the less world tree insures all the trees so that your investment is protected after  years world tree harvests the trees and sells the lumber one of the amazing properties of the tree is that it regrows from the root very quickly after harvesting and will regrow itself up to  times after being cut down a beautiful useful hardwood the empress splendor produces a light straightgrained lumber that is silky to the touch it has an exceptional strength to weight ratio with lumber that is  stronger than pine empress wood is very light strong and water resistant when dry this combination of strength lightweight and water resistance makes it the ideal wood for building boats and surfboards paulownia wood is becoming every more popular with surfers looking for an environmentally friendly alternative to fibreglass boards empress wood is also used for the production of musical instruments furniture windows doors and crown moulding it can be peeled for veneer in  inch thickness and the chinese use the veneer as paper frequently asked questions where do the trees grow empress trees grow in western canada and the united states they grow best in places with summer temperatures of °f °c and above for at least  months a year and an altitude of less than  feet the warmer the temperatures the faster the growth world tree farmers can be found in florida arizona georgia ohio british columbia and costa rica is this tree invasive the short answer is no the empress splendor tree is not invasive the empress splendor tree belongs to the genus paulownia there are many different species of paulownia and there is only one that is classified as invasive the paulownia tomentosa httpwwwinvasivespeciesinfogovplantsprintreeshtml we do not use this variety choosing instead noninvasive species such as the paulownia fortuneii the rainforest alliance has chosen paulownia as an an ecologically sound tree for the purposes of eforestation and carbon sequestration httpwwwrainforestallianceorgbusinessclimatevalidationverificationprojectspaulownia the rainforest alliance is internationally recognized as a certification program for sustainable forestry and best practices for tree planting and agroforestry are the trees genetically modified no our trees are not genetically modified gmo gmo refers to an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques these sometimes contain genes from totally unrelated species such as salmon genes in tomatoes developed to have frost resistance and this raises concerns that as such an organism could not possibly develop naturally we don’t know the long term effects our paulownia trees are bred using conventional methods as used by farmers for thousands of years ie we cross pollinate different lines of the same genus paulownia and then grow the seedlings out selecting the best and then propagate only from those best trees to develop new varieties we do not splice in genes from outside the paulownia genus there is no unrelated genetic material whether plant or animal included in the genome of our trees are the trees organically grown our program attracts many organic farmers because empress splendor trees don’t respond well to chemical products and prefer natural fertilizers and pest control for example they love chicken manure why havent i heard of this tree before the empress tree is indigenous to north america however it almost died out during the ice ages the tree does not grow well from seed it is best grown from the roots and it’s only recently that north americans have taken an interest in growing the tree fre the world tree carbon offset program

investors in  as an investor you will subscribe for class a limited partnership units in the partnership the partnership will acquire trees on behalf of the partnership with a portion of the funds raised from the sale of units these trees are planted by farmers who have been selected for their experience in growing empress splendor trees the manager world tree technologies inc oversees the whole process with a view to producing the highest quality lumber possible once the trees reach maturity in  years they are sold for lumber and the profits are shared  with the farmer and the partnership carbon investors as an investor you will subscribe for class a limited partnership units in the partnership  empress splendor trees are acquired for every class a unit you receive both

for the trees participating farmers are carefully chosen for their experience in growing empress splendor trees the trees are only planted in appropriate growing areas in canada the united states and select parts of central america return on investment once the distributions of profit from the harvest and sale of the lumber have been made between the farmers and the partnership the partnership’s share of the profits will be distributed  to investors and  to management one unit in the partnership costs  usd the partnership will plant and grow  acres of empress splendor trees for every unit

on the quality and finish of the wood we can’t predict the future or what will happen to the price of lumber in years to come carbon investors  world tree  farmers  frequently asked questions who plants the trees and where do they grow the trees are planted by world tree certified farmers these are farmers who already have experience successfully growing empress trees empress trees grow best in places with summer temperatures of °f °c and above for at least  months a year and an altitude of less than  feet our farmers are located in canada the united states and select regions of central america what are the biggest risks in participating in this program the biggest risk is that something happens to the trees due to severe weather or other natural events the trees are most vulnerable when they are young if anything happens to the trees in the first two years world tree replaces them your trees are not planted in a single location we pool your trees with all the other trees that have been purchased this year and plant them across a number of farms this means that if one farm does get hit by a problem it only has a small impact on each investor remember that all investments carry risks we can’t predict the future and we don’t know for sure the value of the lumber in  years time risk factors are described in the offering memorandum and individuals are advised to read this document in full before investing how do i know i will get a good return on investment there are no guarantees when you make any kind of investment investor returns are dependent upon the amount of lumber produced and how much it sells for a well managed acre plot yields up to  board feet of lumber currently empress splendor lumber currently sells for between  and  or higher depending on the quality and finish of the wood we can’t predict the future or what will happen to the price of lumber in years to come when do i get my return you receive your return on investment  years after you sign your subscription agreement once a year you will receive a report with pictures of your trees and statistics on the growth of your trees are the trees genetically modified no our trees are not genetically modified gmo gmo refers to an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques these sometimes contain genes from totally unrelated species such as salmon genes in tomatoes developed to have frost resistance and this raises concerns that as such an organism could not possibly develop naturally we don’t know the long term effects our paulownia trees are bred using conventional methods as used by farmers for thousands of years ie we cross pollinate different lines of the same genus paulownia and then grow the seedlings out selecting the best and then propagate only from those best trees to develop new varieties we do not splice in genes from outside the paulownia genus there is no unrelated genetic material whether plant or animal included in the genome of our trees are the trees organically grown yes empress splendor trees don’t respond well to chemical products and are best when they are grown organically for example they love chicken manure the bark of the tree is moist which most insects don’t like this means that the tree is naturally insect repellant and fire retardant disclaimer this presentation is intended for
