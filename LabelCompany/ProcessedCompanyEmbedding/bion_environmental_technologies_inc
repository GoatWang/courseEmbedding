streams and groundwater contamination severe impacts to water quality can be seen in most major us watersheds notably the chesapeake bay great lakes and the mississippi river basingulf of mexico nutrients come from a variety of sources point sources that are closely regulated such as municipal sewage treatment power plants and industrial facilities and nonpoint sources that are subject to much less if any regulation such as storm water runoff and agriculture learn more about nutrients on the epa’s website nine million dairy cows  million beef cattle  million swine and billions of poultry in the us produce more than  times more organic waste than humans but where human waste makes its way to a septic tank or sewage treatment plant livestock waste is usually spread untreated on the ground for its fertilizer value these nutrients often overwhelm the crops’ and surrounding environment’s ability to absorb them and runoff to contaminate local ground and fresh water resources as well as downstream lakes and coastal estuaries runoff from livestock waste has been identified as one of the largest sources of excess nutrients in most major watersheds we have recently realized that the greatest source of nutrients from livestock is from ammonia that volatizes from the waste this ammonia is highly volatile and redeposits everywhere – forests and fields rivers and lakes parking lots and rooftops – where it is picked up in runoff according to the us epa’s national rivers and streams assessment  over  percent of our nations rivers and streams are in poor biological health the most widespread problem being nitrogen and phosphorus weedchoked waterways fish kills loss of aquatic insects that are a critical part of the food chain and loss of overall biodiversity are all symptoms of excess nutrients us epa considers excess nutrients “one of america’s most widespread costly and challenging environmental problems” a  veolia and international food and policy research report draws a similar conclusion on a global basis the chesapeake bay is one of the most nutrientpolluted estuaries in the united states mostly due to nitrogen phosphorus and sediment runoff from

digital benefits  bion environmental technologies proven comprehensive treatment and resource recovery for livestock waste cleaner farms…cleaner water…cleaner air…better economics benefits direct treatment of livestock waste while it is still concentrated and before it has a chance to contaminate downstream ecosystems can save us taxpayers billions of dollars in annual costs to clean up the chesapeake bay great lakes and mississippi river basin and in the many smaller watersheds where excess nutrients are an issue moreover the lowcost improvements available at our largest livestock production facilities represent highimpact solutions that can help speed the recovery of these watersheds our traditional clean water strategy that focuses spending on downstream ‘point sources’ is no longer up to the task of maintaining water quality up or downstream a new strategy that addresses all of the pollution sources in the watershed will greatly improve water quality and ecosystem health throughout the watershed accelerate cleanup and reduce costs a  study by the chesapeake bay foundation the economic benefits of cleaning up the chesapeake bay estimated the value of the land and waters of the bay region prior to implementation of the  tmdl at  billion annually further the study estimated that a cleaned up bay would be valued at  billion annually comparable or larger numbers could be expected for the great lakes and mississippi river basin although those studies have not been done the bay’s declining grass beds are a bellwether of its health and provide critical habitat for the iconic blue crab and several species of fish improved water quality will allow the beds to return to historic levels treating livestock waste at its source promotes environmental health throughout the watershed and generates a wide range of benefits to local ecosystems and communities that cannot be achieved through more difficult and dilute downstream treatment reducing nutrient runoff to surface and ground water can avoid future costs to treat drinking water high nitrate levels in drinking water can lead to “blue baby” syndrome that in infants reduces the blood’s capacity to carry oxygen pregnant women are also at risk from elevated nitrates and some health studies suggest that higher levels can lead to formation of cancercausing substances in adults elevated nitrate levels in aquifers and water wells have become a growing problem in several states with livestock production frequent waste collection followed by advanced treatment dramatically reduces ammonia greenhouse gases and other air emissions livestock production is the largest source of ammonia in the us and the world ammonia contributes to the formation of pm fine inhalable particulate air pollution that poses significant health risks for heart and lung disease especially in the young and elderly ammonia also adds to both groundwater contamination as well as surface runoff through atmospheric deposition of nitrogen that is then picked up in stormwater runoff direct treatment can largely eliminate pathogens in the waste stream outbreaks of foodborne illness often fatal are regularly traced back to contamination from livestock waste used to fertilize crops antibioticresistant bacteria due to overuse in livestock production is a widely and hotlydebated issue several recent studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of mrsa and other antibioticresistant bacteria in humans that live near fields that have been treated with both raw swine and dairy manure increased hormone levels that interfere with fish reproduction have been found in several pennsylvania rivers higher hormone levels and their impacts have been linked to runoff from livestock waste treating livestock waste at its source isn’t just common sense – it makes economic sense substantially reduced clean water compliance costs to the tax payer avoidance of future costs to pretreat drinking water due to nitrate contamination improved water quality and ecosystem health throughout the watershed increased economic activity and improved quality of life in “upstream” rural communities the chesapeake bay provides habitat that supports a wide variety birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles improved water quality promotes biodiversity that is key to ecosystem health striped bass are a mainstay of the bay’s commercial and recreational fishing industries their populations have suffered steep declines as a result of reduced water quality and habitat loss oysters

performance financial condition business strategies and other information involve substantial risks and uncertainties the companys actual results of operations most of which are beyond the companys control could differ materially these statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as may will expect believe anticipate estimate or continue or the negative thereof we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements which speak only as of the date made any forward looking statements represent managements best judgment as to what may occur in the future however forward looking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected these factors include adverse economic conditions entry of new and stronger competitors inadequate capital unexpected costs failure or delay to gain product or regulatory approvals in the united states or particular states or foreign countries and failure to capitalize upon access to new markets additional risks and uncertainties that may affect forward looking statements about bions business and prospects include the possibility that markets for nutrient reduction credits discussed below andor other ways to monetize nutrient reductions will be slow to develop or not develop at all the existing default by pa on its loan secured by the kreider  system the possibility that a competitor will develop a more comprehensive or less expensive environmental solution bions limited management team delays in market awareness of bion and our systems uncertainties and costs related to research and development efforts to update and improve bions technologies and applications thereof andor delays in bions development of projects and failure of marketing strategies each of which could have both immediate and long term material adverse effects by placing us behind our competitors and requiring expenditures of our limited resources bion disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events currently bion is focused on using applications of its patented and proprietary waste management technologies and technology platform to pursue three main business opportunities  installation of bion systems some of which may generate verified nutrient credits and revenues from the production of renewable energy and byproducts to retrofit and environmentally remediate existing cafos retrofits in selected markets where a government policy supports such efforts such as the chesapeake bay watershed some great lakes basin states andor other states and watersheds facing epa total maximum daily load tmdl issues andor b where cafos need our technology to obtain permits to expand or develop without negative environmental consequences  development of new stateoftheart large scale waste treatment facilities in strategic locations projects some of these may be integrated projects as described below with multiple revenue streams and  licensing andor joint venturing of bions technology and applications primarily outside north america the opportunities described at  and  above each require substantial political and regulatory federal state and local efforts on the part of the company and a substantial part of bions efforts are focused on such political and regulatory matters bion is currently pursuing the international opportunities primarily through the use of consultants with existing relationships in target during  the company commenced actively pursuing the opportunity presented by environmental retrofit and remediation of the waste streams of existing cafos which effort has met with very limited success to date the first commercial activity in this area is represented by our agreement with kreider farms kf pursuant to which the kreider  system to treat kfs dairy waste streams to reduce nutrient releases to the environment while generating marketable nutrient credits and renewable energy was designed constructed and entered fullscale operation during  on january   the board of the pennsylvania infrastructure investment authority pennvest approved a  million loan to bion pa  llc pa a whollyowned subsidiary of the company for the initial kreider farms project kreider  system after substantial unanticipated delays on august   pa received a permit for construction of the kreider  system construction activities commenced during november  the closingsettlement of the pennvest loan took place on november   pa finished the construction of the kreider  system and entered a period of system operational shakedown during may  the kreider  system reached full stabilized operation by the end of the  fiscal year during  the padep recertified the nutrient credits for this project the padep issued final permits for the kreider  system including the credit verification plan on august   on which date the company deemed that the kreider system was placed in service as a result pa commenced generating nutrient reduction credits for potential sale while continuing to utilize the kreider  system to test improvements and addons however to date liquidity in the pennsylvania nutrient credit market has been slow to develop significant breadth and depth which limited liquiditydepth has negatively impacted bions business plans and has resulted in challenges to monetizing the nutrient reductions created by pas existing kreider  project and bions other proposed projects these difficulties have prevented pa from generating any material revenues from the kreider  project to date and raise significant questions as to when if ever pa will be able to generate such revenues from the kreider  system pa has had sporadic discussionsnegotiations with pennvest related to forbearance andor restructuring its obligations pursuant to the pennvest loan for more than three years in the context of such discussionsnegotiations pa elected not to make interest payments to pennvest on the pennvest loan since january  additionally the company has not made any principal payments which were to begin in fiscal  and therefore the company has classified the pennvest loan as a current liability as of december   due to the failure of the pa nutrient reduction credit market to develop the company determined that the carrying amount of the property and equipment related to the kreider  project exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows based on certain assumptions regarding timing level and probability of revenues from sales of nutrient reduction credits and therefore pa and the company recorded impairments related to the value of the kreider  assets of  and  at june   and june   respectively during the  fiscal year effective june   pa and the company recorded an impairment of  to the value of the kreider  assets which reduced the value on the companys books to  this impairment reflects managements judgment that the salvage value of the kreider  assets roughly equals pas contractual obligations related to the kreider  system including expenses related to decommissioning of the kreider  system costs associated with needed capital upgrade expenses and recertification permitting amendments see impairment loss on property and equipment below on september   pennvest exercised its right to declare the pennvest loan in default and accelerated the pennvest loan and demanded that pa pay  principal interest plus late charges on or before october   pa did not make the payment and does not have the resources to make the payments demanded by pennvest pa has commenced discussions and negotiations with pennvest concerning this matter but pennvest has rejected pas proposal made during the fall of  as of the date of this report no formal proposals are currently under consideration and only sporadic communication has taken place regarding the matters involved over the last  months it is not possible at this date to predict the outcome of this matter but the company believes that a loan modification agreement may be reached in the future ifwhen a more robust market for nutrient reductions develops in pa of which there is no assurance pa and bion will continue to evaluate various options with regard to kreider  over the next  days the economics potential revenues profitability and continued operation of the kreider  system are based almost entirely on the long term sale of nutrient nitrogen andor phosphorus reduction credits to meet the requirements of the chesapeake bay environmental cleanup see below for further discussion during august  the company provided pennvest and the padep with data demonstrating that the kreider  system met the technology guaranty standards which were incorporated in the pennvest financing documents and as a result the pennvest loan has been and is now solely an obligation of pa since that date note that while bion believes that the kreider  system the kreider  project andor subsequent bion projects will eventually generate revenue from the sale of a nutrient reductions credits or in other form b renewable energy and related credits c sales of fertilizer products andor d potentially in time credits for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions we believe that the potential market is very large but it is not possible to predict the exact timing andor magnitude of these potential markets at this time a significant portion of bions current activities concern efforts with private and public stakeholders at local and state level in pa and other chesapeake bay midwest and great lakes states and at the federal level epa and other executive departments and congress to establish appropriate public policies which will create regulations and funding mechanisms that foster installation of the low cost technologybased environmental solutions that bion and others can provide through cleanup of agricultural waste streams in january  the pennsylvania legislative budget and finance committee issued a report stating that targeting upstream livestock would save pennsylvanias taxpayers up to  of previously estimated costs potential savings for pa in excess of a billion dollars per year over the next  years which would be available for other needs notably aging drinking water and sewer infrastructure while creating large local benefits of an upstream treatment strategy including reduced freshwater compliance costs future cost avoidance of treating drinking water from contaminated local aquifers and increased economic activity for agriculture tourism and recreation the coalition for an affordable bay solution coalition was formed to support the creation of a competitivelybid nitrogen trading program in pennsylvania that will enable pennsylvania to capture the economic benefits outlined in the legislative study the coalition supports legislation to establish a competitivelybid rfp program for nitrogen reductions where bids will also be scored to reflect the value of the benefits to pas interior waterways and communities founding members of the coalition represent both chesapeake bay and national industry participants and include bion jbs sa kreider farms and fair oaks farms the head of the coalition is ed schafer bions vice chairman the company believes that i the april  release of a report from the pennsylvania auditor general titled special report on the importance of meeting pennsylvanias chesapeake bay nutrient reduction targets which highlighted the economic consequences of epaimposed sanctions if the state fails to meet the  tmdl targets as well as the need to support using lowcost solutions and technologies as alternatives to highercost public infrastructure projects where possible and ii the april  introduction of senate bill  successor to prior sb  the watershed improvement act which if adopted would have established a program that will allow the pennsylvanias tax and ratepayers to meet their epamandated chesapeake bay pollution reductions at significantly lower cost by purchasing verified reductions by competitive bidding from all sources including those that bion can produce through livestock waste treatment represent visible evidence of progress being made on these matters in pennsylvania such legislation if passed and signed into law will potentially enable bion and others to compete for public funding on an equal basis with subsidized agricultural best management practices and public works and storm water authorities on may   the pa senate majority policy committee held a hearing on sb  testifying in support of this legislation was elliot keller of jbs in souderton pa phil durgin  executive director of the pa legislative budget and finance committee ron kreider of kreider farms ed schafer representing the coalition and mike mccloskey representing the national milk distributors association bions activity related to such legislation has intensified with increased stakeholder support and increasing attacks on the company by those opposed to the legislation and bion believes the primary provisions of such legislation will be incorporated into legislation that may be passed in some version by the pennsylvania legislature during  but cannot predict the exact final content of such legislation or guarantee such passage note however that there was vocal opposition to sb  from threatened stakeholders committed to the existing status quo approaches a significant portion of which was focused on attacking in often inaccurate andor vilifying ways bion inthrough social media and internet articles blogs press releases twitter posts and retweets rather than engaging the substantive issues the company responded in a press release and postings on its website as a result bion is exploring the use of social media including facebook twitter and other approaches to accurately communicate about the companys business and positions if legislation similar to sb  is passed and implemented in something close to its current form bion expects that the policies and strategies being developed in pa will not only benefit the companys existing and proposed pa projects but will also subsequently provide the basis for a larger chesapeake bay watershed strategy and thereafter a national clean water strategy the company believes that pennsylvania is ground zero in the longstanding clean water battle between agriculture and the further regulation of agriculture relative to nutrient impacts the ability of bion and other technology providers to achieve verified reductions from agricultural nonpoint sources can resolve the current stalemate and enable implementation of constructive solutions that benefit all stakeholders providing a mechanism that ensures that taxpayer funds will be used to achieve the most beneficial result at the lowest cost regardless of source all sources point and nonpoint rural and urban will be able to compete for tax payerfunded nitrogen reductions in a fair and transparent process and since payment from the tax and rate payers would now be performancebased these providers will be held financially accountable we believe that the overwhelming environmental economic quality of life and public health benefits to all stakeholders in the watershed both within and outside of pennsylvania make the case for adoption of the strategies outlined in the report less an issue of if but of when and how the adoption of a competitive procurement program will have significant positive impact on technology providers that can deliver verified nitrogen reductions such as bion by allocating existing tax and ratepayer clean water funding to low cost solutions based upon a voluntary and transparent procurement process the company believes that implementation of a competitivelybid nutrient reduction program to achieve the goals for the chesapeake bay watershed can also provide a working policy model and platform for other states to adopt that will enhance their efforts to comply with both current and future requirements for local and federal estuarine watersheds including the mississippi rivergulf of mexico the great lakes basin and other nutrientimpaired watersheds bion will also pursue the opportunities related to development of projects including integrated projects integrated projects will include large cafos such as large dairies beef cattle feed lots andor hog farms with bion waste treatment system modules processing the aggregate cafo waste stream from the equivalent of  to  or more beef or dairy cows or the waste stream equivalent of other species while recovering cellulosic biomass to be utilized for renewable energy production and possibly high nutrient fine solids to be marketed as feed andor fertilizer integrated with cafo end product usersprocessing facilities andor a biofuelethanol plant capable of producing  million to  or more million gallons of ethanol per year such integrated projects will involve multiple cafo modules of  or more beef or dairy cows or waste stream equivalent of other species with waste treatment modules on a single site andor on sites within an approximately  mile radius bion believes its technology platform g tech g tech andor a hybrid in different situations will allow integration of largescale cafos with end product processors andor ethanol production together with renewable energy production from cellulosic biomass recovered from the waste streams and onsite energy utilization in a closed loop manner that will reduce the capital expenditures operating costs and carbon footprint for the entire integrated project and each component facility some projects may be developed from scratch while others may be developed in geographic proximity to and in coordination with existing participating cafos ethanol plants andor end product processors each project is likely to have different degrees of integration especially in the early development phases the company currently anticipates that the kreider  poultry waste treatment facility in pa will be its initial project bion anticipates that it will select a site for the kreider  project andor its initial integrated project and possibly additional projects during calendar year  bion hopes to commence development of its initial project by optioning land and beginning the sitespecific design and permitting process during calendar year  but delays are possible it is not possible at this time to firmly predict where the initial project will be developed or the order in which projects will be developed all potential projects are in very early predevelopment stages and may never progress to actual development or may be developed after other projects not yet under active consideration bion also hopes to be able to move forward on additional projects through  to create a pipeline of projects management has a year development target through calendar year  of approximately  or more projects management hopes to have identified and begun development work related to  projects over the next  years at the end of the year period bion projects that  of these projects will be in full operation in  states and possibly one or more foreign countries and the balance would be in various stages ranging from partial operation to early development stage it is possible that one or more projects will be developed in joint ventures specifically targeted to meet the growing animal protein demand outside of the united states including without limitation asia europe andor the middle east no projects including integrated projects has been developed to date

harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer but what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients including kidney and lung cancer in fact research from the american association for cancer research shows that for advancedmelanoma patients survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer tweet biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working

diabetes patients thrive helping diabetes patients thrive share tweet link email print diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the

welcome to the future of medicine where disease is no match for tenacity no match for ingenuity where together we go boldly do not go gentle todays breakthroughs are becoming tomorrows medicines watch the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news
