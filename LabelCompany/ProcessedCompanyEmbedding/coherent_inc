innovative products superb technology total quality support and satisfaction employees with a challenging fulfilling place to work while expanding their skills and horizons stockholders with consistent returns on equity capital and longterm growth in sales and earnings history of coherent inc coherent inc manufactures and sells lasers and laserrelated products to the commercial scientific and medical markets coherent lasers comprising the broadest range of products produced by any laser manufacturer are used in a variety of applications ranging from surgical procedures to the manufacturing of semiconductors the company operates facilities at approximately two dozen sites in a number of foreign countries deriving more than half its revenue from international sales sales and service sites are located in the united states mexico germany the united kingdom france belgium the netherlands sweden hong kong and the peoples republic of china origins the invention of the laser an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation represented one of the technological milestones of the th century developed at bell laboratories in  the laser promised to ignite a technological revolution its vast potential galvanizing the attention of scientists worldwideone scientist in particular physicist james hobart hobart was intrigued by the possible applications for lasers specifically the use of lasers in factory settings he envisioned lasers performing tasks such as cutting and welding metal but was unable to convince management at his place of employment spectraphysics inc to pursue the development of industrial lasers determined to see his ideas manifested hobart enlisted the help of five other individuals and started his own company coherent was founded in may  when hobart was in his early s the companys start was modest backed by the  hobart and his associates were able to come up with for coherents startup capital with limited financial resources the founders established company headquarters in the palo alto california home of eugene watson a former sales and marketing manager for spectraphysics initially the most pressing need was for a volt outlet to power the laser they intended to build which forced coherents brain trust to build the laser in a laundry room the only place in watsons house with a suitable outlet next to a washer and dryer hobart and his colleagues began building coherents first product during the summer of  using a piece of a rain gutter as one of the key components of their prototype industrial laser despite the somewhat crude methods of their homespun efforts the entrepreneurs achieved remarkable results swiftly compensating for their lack of resources with ingenuity four months after the company was founded coherent unveiled its first laser at the westcon trade show a precision instrument that had shed its rain gutter vestiges and evolved into a shiny telescopelike device more important than aesthetics manufacturers were interested in coherents first product the laser coherent built during the summer of  was the first carbon dioxide laser available commercially the power output of the companys first product set a precedent forcing coherent to develop a power meter capable of measuring its power the power meter became the companys second product a device that continued to garner sales  years later in the fall of  however the primary focus was on selling the laser boeing co was the first company to order a coherent laser hobart performed the installation of the laser himself in january  inadvertently burning a hole through a sport coat hanging on a chair during the process hobart paid to replace the sport coat and after the initial foible secured coherents first satisfied customer market diversification in the ss after receiving capital from the rockefeller family coherent converted to public ownership in  the company developed a family of industrial lasers to complement its first product diversifying from there into medical and scientific markets where applications for lasers were in abundance as the years passed coherents commitment to research and development spawned a diverse range of lasers stretching from small argon green lasers for use in eye surgery to invisible carbon dioxide lasers developed to cut metal coherent lasers were used to repair herniated discs to study biological and semiconductor processes and to light walls of water at disneyland the applications were manifold developed by a highly regarded and expansive research and development team coherent has more phds on staff than most competitors have employees remarked an industry analyst to california business in  the dedication to developing new types of lasers to address everexpanding needs bolstered coherents stature with lasers developed and marketed for industrial scientific and medical markets the company ranked as the largest independent laser maker in the world by the early s the companys elite industry position however did not guarantee a commensurate standing in financial matters despite a full roster of laser products and despite its impressive intellectual talent coherent did not boast a financial stature that was reflective of its global dominance in a significant technological sector lasers had failed to produce the kind of investor returns and swelling financial figures typical of other major technological breakthroughs such as computers semiconductors and fiber optics part of coherents problem which became more evident as the s progressed was that lasers had become relatively easy to develop as the technology underpinning their development matured lasers took on the market characteristics of commodity items particularly lasers used in compact disc players and telephone lines to produce lasers for medical applications relatively little startup capital was required eliminating what otherwise would have served as a formidable obstacle barring entry to startup companies accordingly the number of coherents competitors proliferated weakening the companys market position beyond external pressures coherent also suffered from internal difficulties perhaps the most deleterious source of the companys problems during the s early s joint venture creates crisis by the late s a number of industry observers had begun to brand coherent as an underachiever hailing the companys potential yet deriding its financial performance in  coherent was tagged by forbes as laser laggard and by california business as a lagging laser maker unflattering appellations that drew their source from analysts who watched the global leader in lasers stumble financially one of the chief and most enduring internal problems stemmed from an early s joint venture with general electric co the subsidiary created through the joint venture was sturidge massachusettsbased coherent general inc shortly after its formation coherent general prematurely introduced an industrial laser that suffered from profound problems in the aftermath coherents reputation which had been steadily cultivated since the early days in watsons laundry room was seriously tarnished equally troubling coherent lost its market lead to siemens the aftershocks of the lasers flop reverberated outward some of coherents customers in the machine tool business realized that making lasers to punch holes cut metals and weld materials could be done internally as coherent lost market share to its closest rival and to its own customers other problems unrelated to coherent generals miscue emerged looking back at the troubled s terry mcgoldrick director of operations of coherent laser group part of the companys scientific unit succinctly summarized coherents mistakes inability to perform was our basic problem he conceded to california business in february  the company inadequately dealt with corporate functions revolving around quality delivery and service in  for instance mcgoldrick estimated that only  percent of coherents deliveries were on time financially the company was struggling losing  million in  another  million in  and after posting a profit of  million in  registering a loss of  in  as a consequence coherents market value plummeted from  million in  to  million by  punctuating the sweeping problems affecting the company hobart spearheads revival in the early s in the years leading up to coherents downward spiral hobart had delegated management responsibilities to others while he devoted his energies to developing the companys lasers as coherents problems magnified hobart emerged from the laboratory to assume a leading role in the companys management taking on the responsibilities of chief executive officer in august  his first objective was to restructure coherents nonscientific units namely the companys medicalsurgical and industrial units as the reorganization of the nonscientific units was under way hobart used the companys scientific laser group as a testing ground for a multifaceted improvement program patterned after the methods employed by japanese manufacturers employees were trained in the just in time jit system of limited delivery statistical process control spc and continuous process improvement cpi manufacturing all of which stressed an organizationwide commitment to quality and efficiency the scientific laser group was the first to benefit from the jit spc and cpi training programs in  the units production output was  percent greater than in  an increase achieved with  percent fewer employees further the percentage of product defects was cut in half and  percent of deliveries were made on time the drastic improvements prompted an extension of the training programs to other coherent divisions proving instrumental to the companys turnaround as it entered the s although coherent ranked as one of the top five industrial laser makers the business unit continued to produce disappointing financial results as the s began the strength of the company was in medical and scientific lasers where coherent ranked as the market leader in each category hobart presiding as chairman and chief executive officer pinned the companys future on the development of a greater lead in the medical market during the early s coherent derived  percent of its sales from medical lasers but hobart hoped to derive at least half of the companys sales from medical lasers by the mids a feat to be accomplished by investing heavily in research and development in  the company spent more than  million on research and development which led to the introduction of more than  new products in a twoyear span in all the company manufactured and sold more than  different laser products through  production sales and service sites worldwide with the troubles of the late s behind it coherent looked toward the s as its opportunity to realize the rewards of its potential in a sense the beginning of the decade represented a fresh start a new beginning that would be led from new corporate headquarters in  the company paid  million for a squarefoot building in santa clara moving coherent away from its longtime base in palo alto by the time of the move hobarts efforts to cultivate efficiency and greater attention to customer service and quality had produced encouraging results aided in part by the divestiture of coherent general in  at the companys manufacturing facility in auburn california productivity had increased  percent between  and  while overhead costs had been reduced by  percent the implementation of the jit cpi and spc programs coupled with a concerted focus on medical and scientific laser products was enabling coherent to break free at last from the constraints that held annual sales at  million the company was growing evidenced by the expansion of its auburn plant by  percent in  the squarefoot plant which had garnered national awards for its operating efficiency was augmented by an adjacent squarefoot building half of which was set aside for future expansion the need for extra manufacturing space had been necessitated in part by two acquisitions completed in  which helped fuel robust increases in coherents revenue volume in october coherent acquired the diode laser operation of applied laser systems a medford oregon firm whose technology was sought after by companies involved in manufacturing medical instruments alignment and inspections systems the following month coherent purchased the laser optics division of atx telecom systems inc which developed coating processes for lenses and mirrors used in the development of solidstate lasers both of the acquisitions were folded in coherents auburn facility thus creating the need for additional space prior to the acquisitions coherents annual revenue volume had begun to swell after years of languishing at  million in  sales reached  million by the end of the companys fiscal  year concluded in september before the applied laser and atx acquisitions were completed sales shot upward to  million perhaps more important profits for  amounted to  million helping to erase the memories of successive annual losses during the late s in july  bernard j couillaud formerly vicepresident and general manager of coherent laser group was named president and chief executive officer hobarts departure in  positioned couillaud as coherents senior executive against the backdrop of the managerial changes the company completed two notable acquisitions that formed a new business segment in july  coherent acquired the laser diode operations of uniphase corporation in december  the company purchased  percent of tutcore oy ltd a tampere finlandbased company that ranked as the leading manufacturer of aluminumfree semiconductor wafers used to manufacture laser diodes these two acquisitions were organized as a separate business group in august  known as the coherent semiconductor group during the late s coherent demonstrated the consistent performance of an industry leader in november  coherent signed a partnership agreement with palomar medical technologies inc for laserbased hair removal systems the partnership agreement led to the april  acquisition of palomars subsidiary star medical technologies inc a  million transaction that strengthened coherents technology in commercial and medical markets sales by the end of the companys fiscal year in september  reached  million a  percent gain from the previous years total that was outshined by a  percent increase in net income which rose to  million considering coherents role as a pioneer in laser development which had inculcated a commitment to substantial annual investments in research and development the company appeared wellequipped to produce similar financial growth in the years ahead further coherent offered
