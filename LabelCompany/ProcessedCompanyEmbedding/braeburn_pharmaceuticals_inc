pharmaceuticals announces fda approves probuphine® buprenorphine implant the first implant for treatment of opioid dependence posted on may  january   by braeuser patients and providers have a new option to combat opioid dependence princeton nj—may  —braeburn pharmaceuticals announces that the us food  drug administration fda approved probuphine the first implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients who have sustained clinical stability on lowtomoderate doses of buprenorphine specifically  mg or less per day probuphine delivers buprenorphine continuously for up to six months and should be used as part of a complete treatment program to include counseling and psychosocial support “patients and their doctors now have probuphine as a new option for the sixmonth treatment of opioid dependence opioid addiction is a chronic disease and should be treated the same way we treat other serious chronic diseases—with evidencebased medicine” said president and ceo behshad sheldon braeburn pharmaceuticals “with  people in the us dying each day from opioids it’s important that patients have more treatments to choose from as no one option will work for everyone probuphine is the first of what we hope will be many new and innovative approaches to treating this disease we are grateful to all of the patients investigators and to nida for their help and dedication that has brought us to this point ” buprenorphine is a commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of opioid dependence until today it has only been available in sublingual oral formulations probuphine received a priority review based on the potential to reduce accidental pediatric exposure “probuphine is the first treatment for opioid dependence that provides longterm delivery of an evidencebased medicine” said richard rosenthal professor of psychiatry icahn school of medicine at mount sinai medical director of addiction psychiatry mount sinai behavioral health system “probuphine offers clinically stable patients a new way to continue taking medicine ensuring the dose prescribed is the dose taken” the systemic side effects for probuphine are similar to those that are seen with buprenorphine and in the probuphine clinical trials included headache insomnia upper respiratory tract infection nausea anxiety back pain depression constipation and vomiting in addition common implant site reactions included pain itching redness and swelling “probuphine represents a significant step forward in addressing the serious lack of new treatment options in the last  years with strong support from the president and the secretary of health and human services this year to expand access to medication assisted treatment addiction specialists like myself are more confident we will be able to get more patients the treatment they desperately need” said kelly j clark md mba dfasam dfapa president elect american society of addiction medicine chief medical officer cleanslate centers “opioid dependence touches people from all walks of life no matter their socioeconomic status race or gender the more we educate and innovate the better chance we have at reducing the prevalence of this terrible disease” “buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opioid dependence but was previously only available in pill or film formulation which can be lost forgotten or stolen” said frank j vocci phd president and senior research scientist friends research institute “probuphine’s inherent value as an implant is that patients receive constant levels of buprenorphine for up to six months without having to administer treatment on a daily basis this is an unprecedented benefit of a treatment for opioid dependence” about probuphine probuphine was developed using proneura™ titan pharmaceuticals’ nasdaq ttnp continuous drug delivery system that consists of a small solid implant made from a mixture of ethylenevinyl acetate eva and a drug substance the resulting construct is a solid matrix that is placed subdermally normally in the upper arm in an outpatient office procedure and removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period probuphine

probuphine® buprenorphine implant phase  data presented at cpdd annual scientific meeting posted on june  january   by braeuser results demonstrate the superiority of probuphine for abstinence from opioids for patients over six months princeton nj and palm springs ca — june  —braeburn pharmaceuticals presented data yesterday from the poster of the phase  study of probuphine a sixmonth subdermal buprenorphine implant for the longterm maintenance treatment of opioid dependence at the th annual scientific meeting of the college on problems of drug dependence cpdd the us food and drug administration fda approved probuphine on may   the study demonstrates that participants who were clinically stable on sublingual buprenorphine maintained stability when transferred to probuphine and that they were more likely to sustain abstinence from illicit opioids throughout the six months than participants who remained on sublingual buprenorphine primary efficacy analysis originally presented showed that  percent of participants in the probuphine group had at least four months without evidence of drug use versus  percent in the sublingual buprenorphine group demonstrating superiority of probuphine with a p value of  additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to support the robustness of the primary analysis including the following that were presented at cpdd – statistically significant difference between probuphine and sublingual buprenorphine in the proportion of subjects for all  months without evidence of illicit opioid use  versus  p imputation of all missing values as positive for illicit opioids also demonstrated significant difference  versus  p – a more conservative approach including the use of supplemental sublingual buprenorphine as nonresponders as well as imputing all missing values as positive for illicit opioid use illustrated similar results for probuphine and sublingual buprenorphine  versus  p “nonadherence to medication approved to treat opioid dependence is a leading cause of relapse” said frank j vocci phd president and senior research scientist friends research institute “the study results show that more participants in the implant group sustained at least four months of abstinence from opioids than participants in the sublingual buprenorphine group implanted just under the skin probuphine encourages treatment adherence and adds a new treatment for doctors to utilize to address the opioid dependence epidemic” “in the three weeks since we received fda approval for probuphine we have trained over  healthcare providers who have already begun treating their patients with probuphine” said behshad sheldon ceo braeburn pharmaceuticals “we recognize the importance to both physicians and patients of this new treatment for opioid dependence and are working to train  healthcare providers before the end of the year we are currently conducting training sessions every weekend to accommodate the

stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately  million based upon an assumed initial public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full we estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately  million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us each  increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus would increase or decrease the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately  million assuming that the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us similarly each increase or decrease of one million in the number of shares of common stock offered by us would increase or decrease the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately  million assuming the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us a one million share increase in the number of shares offered by us together with a concomitant  increase in the assumed initial public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus would increase the net proceeds to us from this offering by  million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us conversely a one million share decrease in the number of shares offered by us together with a concomitant  decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus would decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by  million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we currently expect to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows • commercialization of probuphine advancement of product candidates in clinical development and • the remaining proceeds if any to fund new and ongoing research and development activities working capital and other general corporate purposes which may include funding for the hiring of additional personnel capital expenditures and the costs of operating as a public company based on our current plans we believe our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with the net proceeds to us from this offering and the concurrent private placement will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next  months this expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development efforts the status of and results from nonclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments including shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing instruments and us government securities the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies our marketed product and any product candidates that are approved and commercialized compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future we face potential competition from various sources including larger and betterfunded pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as from academic institutions governmental agencies and public and private research institutions our principal competition in the opioid addiction market comes from manufacturers of oral buprenorphine products including indivior plc or indivior which markets the suboxone and subutex brands we may also face additional competition in the longacting buprenorphine market from indivior if its product candidate rbp a monthly buprenorphine injection in phase  development is approved for us marketing we are not aware of any injectable or implantable buprenorphine products in clinicalstage development besides indiviors we anticipate that our primary competitors for cam and probuphine for chronic pain will be manufacturers of opioid analgesics such as oxycodone that are available at doses equivalent to  mg per day of morphine we are not aware of any implantable or injectable opioid products including buprenorphine products in clinicalstage development for pain indications we expect our primary competitor for bb will be janssen pharmaceuticals the manufacturer of longacting injectable formulations of risperidone marketing biweekly and monthly injectable formulations of risperidone or compounds resembling risperidone under the brand names consta and sustenna indivior is in lateclinicalstage development of rbp a monthly risperidone injection based on the same injection technology as used in its rbp buprenorphine injection we expect to have secondary competitors in the manufacturers of injectable formulations of aripiprazole another atypical antipsychotic these include otsuka pharmaceutical co which markets a monthly injectable formulation of aripiprazole under the brand name abilify maintena and alkermes inc which manufactures a monthly injectable formulation of the closelyrelated molecule aripiprazole lauroxil under the brand name aristada many of our competitors either alone or with their strategic partners have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of product candidates and commercializing those product candidates mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available we expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of among other things efficacy safety convenience of administration and delivery price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market company description we are a commercialstage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel longacting medications for serious disorders of the central nervous system or cns our proprietary implantable and injectable delivery mechanisms provide differentiated solutions for chronic diseases with high unmet medical needs our specialty cns focus is on fastgrowing therapeutic areas recognized as serious public health crises where longacting technologies offer important benefits such as increased medication compliance improved patient convenience reduced risk of abuse and relapse and reduced public health and societal costs our lead therapeutic area is opioid addiction which affects  million people in the united states across all socioeconomic groups a  survey from the kaiser family foundation indicates that nearly half of all americans know someone who suffers from opioid addiction we have one approved product probuphine a sixmonth buprenorphine implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid addiction which was approved by the food and drug administration or fda on may   in november  we reported positive topline results from a phase  trial of weekly and monthly cam an injectable formulation of buprenorphine for opioid addiction cam achieved noninferiority compared to oral daily buprenorphine based on the primary endpoint and superiority to oral daily buprenorphine based on a secondary endpoint our other therapeutic areas of focus are pain schizophrenia and spasticity which refers to feelings of stiffness and a wide range of involuntary muscle spasms we have four additional latestage product candidates in our pipeline across our different therapeutic areas as well as two earlierstage product candidates we believe that longacting medications for specialty cns conditions are not just a matter of convenience but are an essential tool for the effective treatment of these diseases these are chronic cns conditions requiring constant vigilance where the consequences of suboptimal treatment compliance can range from severe to lifethreatening for our therapeutic areas of focus we are developing weekly monthly and sixmonth dosage formulations we believe that our medications will allow healthcare providers to treat patients throughout the continuum of care providing personalized drug delivery that is optimized to help patients progress from treatment initiation through longterm maintenance to date our postapproval commercialization efforts for probuphine have been focused on a medical affairs driven introduction including training healthcare providers to prescribe and implant probuphine working with payors to ensure comprehensive reimbursement and implementing our new specialty pharmacy distribution model we are planning a fullscale commercial launch of probuphine with our new fullydeployed field force in the first quarter of  which we intend to further expand if and when we launch

tweet link email print diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are

the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news
