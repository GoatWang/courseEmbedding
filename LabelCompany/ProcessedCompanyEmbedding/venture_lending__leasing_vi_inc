    see notes to financial statements                organization and operations of the fund venture lending  leasing vi inc the “fund” was incorporated in maryland on january   as a nondiversified closedend management investment company electing status as a business development company “bdc” under the investment company act of  and is managed by westech investment advisors inc “manager” or “management”  one hundred percent of the stock of the fund is held by venture lending  leasing vi llc the “company”  prior to commencing its operations on june   the fund had no operations other than the sale to the company of  shares of common stock  par value for  in january   this issuance of stock was a requirement in order to apply for a finance lenders license from the california commissioner of corporations   in the managers opinion the accompanying financial statements include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations  the interim results for the period ended june   are not necessarily indicative of what the results would be for a full year    summary of significant accounting policies   basis of accounting   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and money market funds in banks with maturities of  days or less   interest income   interest income on loans is recognized using the effective interest method including amounts from the amortization of discounts resulting from the allocation of amounts ascribed to equity securities received as part of the loan transaction  additionally fees received as part of the transaction are added to the loan discount and amortized over the life of the loan   valuation procedures   the fund accounts for loans at fair value in accordance with the “valuation methods” below  all valuations are determined under the direction of the manager in accordance with this policy   the fund’s loans are valued in connection with the issuance of its periodic financial statements the issuance or repurchase of the fund’s shares at a price equivalent to the current net asset value per share and at such other times as required by law  on a quarterly basis management will submit to the board of directors “board” a “valuation report” which details the rationale for the valuation of investments  valuation methods as of june   the financial statements include nonmarketable investments of  or approximately  of total assets with fair values determined by the manager in the absence of readily determinable market values  because of the inherent uncertainty of these valuations estimated fair values of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed and the differences could be material below is the information used by the manager in making these estimates             fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  there is no secondary market for the loans hence management determines fair value based on hypothetical markets  venture loans are generally held to maturity and are recorded at estimated fair value  management determines whether to adjust the estimated fair value of a loan based on a number of factors including but not limited to the borrower’s payment history available cash and “burn rate” revenues net income or loss the likelihood that the borrower will be able to secure additional financing in the future as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment  the amount of any valuation adjustment is determined based upon a credit analysis of the borrower and an analysis of the expected recovery from the borrower including consideration of factors such as the nature and quality of the fund’s security interests in collateral the estimated value of the fund’s collateral the size of the loan and the estimated time that will elapse before the fund achieves a recovery    money market funds held as cash and cash equivalents are valued at their most recently posted net asset value if available or at amortized cost provided such amount is not materially different from quoted price warrants and stock warrants and stock that are received in connection with loan transactions generally will be assigned a fair value at the time of acquisition these securities are then distributed by the fund to the company at the assigned value warrants are valued based on a modified blackscholes option pricing model which takes into account underlying stock value expected term volatility and riskfree interest rate among other factors   nonaccrual loans the fund’s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan stops performing and management deems that it is uncertain that the loan will return to performing status  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed for the quarter in which the loan was placed on nonaccrual status  any uncollected interest related to quarters prior to when the loan was placed on nonaccrual status is added to the principal balance and the aggregate balance of the principal and interest is evaluated in accordance with the policy for valuation of loans in determining management’s best estimate of fair value no loans were classified as nonaccrual as of june   commitment fees unearned income and commitment fees on loans are recognized using the effective interest method over the term of the loan commitment fees are carried as liabilities when received for commitments upon which no draws have been made when the first draw is made the fee is treated as unearned income and is recognized as described above  if a draw is never made the commitment fee less any applicable legal costs becomes recognized as other income after the commitment expires credit risks     most of the companies with which the fund enters into financing transactions have not achieved profitability experience substantial fluctuations in their operating results or in some cases do not have significant operating revenues  the ability of these companies to meet their obligations to the fund therefore depends to a significant extent on the willingness of a borrowers equity venture capital investors or outside investors to provide additional equity financing which in turn depends on the borrowers success in meeting its business plan the market climate for venture capital investments generally and many other factors  the companies to which the fund provides financing frequently engage in the development of new products or technologies and the success of these efforts or the ability of the companies to successfully manufacture or market products or technologies developed cannot be assured  these companies frequently face intense competition including competition from companies with greater resources and may face risks of product or technological obsolescence nonacceptance in the market or rapidly changing regulatory environments any of which could adversely affect their prospects  the success of such companies often depends on the management talents and efforts of one person or small group of persons whose death disability or resignation would adversely affect the company           emerging company risks     the possibility that the companies in which the fund invests will not be able to commercialize their technology or product concept presents significant risk to the fund  additionally although some of such companies may already have a commercially successful product or product line at the time of investment technology products and services often have a more limited market or life span than products in other industries  thus the ultimate success of these companies may depend on their ability to continually innovate in increasingly competitive markets  most of the companies in which the fund invests will require substantial additional equity financing to satisfy their continuing growth and working capital requirements  each round of venture financing is typically intended to provide a company with enough capital to reach the next stage of development  the circumstances or market conditions under which such companies will seek additional capital is unpredictable  it is possible that one or more of such companies will not be able to raise additional financing or may be able to do so only at a price or on terms which are unfavorable   challenges in financial markets     the ability of the fund to provide an acceptable return may be adversely affected by economic factors to which the marketplace is subject  volatility in the global financial markets reached unprecedented levels during the past few years and these conditions may continue into the near future the fund’s estimates of fair value are based on the best information available to the manager as of the date of valuation restrictions on the availability of financing as well as the current economic environment have resulted in a low volume of purchase and sale transactions limiting the number of observable input available to management in making their estimates of fair value this market turmoil could have a material adverse effect on the fund’s business and operations market turmoil could impact the fund’s ability to secure a debt facility at terms acceptable to the fund  should the fund not be able to secure a facility of the size it seeks the fund’s ability to utilize leverage to maximize the return it achieves on investments will be impaired    market conditions could also adversely impact the ability of the fund’s borrowers to meet their obligations to the fund and the value of the fund’s direct investments in companies  most of the companies in which the fund invests have not achieved profitability and require substantial equity financing to satisfy their continuing growth and working capital requirements  the economic downturn could decrease the demand for such borrower’s products and technology thereby impairing such borrower’s financial condition and ability to raise additional equity financing from outside investors  this could result in an increase in borrower defaults under their obligations to the fund or a decrease in the value of the fund’s direct equity investments  us and global economic conditions could continue to deteriorate and remain weak for an extended period of time additionally it is possible that market conditions could decrease the demand for venture loans   recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  “asu ” improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which among other things amends asc  to require entities to separately present purchases sales issuances and settlements in their reconciliation of level  fair value measurements ie to present such items on a gross basis rather than on a net basis and which clarifies existing disclosure requirements provided by asc   regarding the level of disaggregation and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall within either level  or level  of the fair value hierarchy  asu  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level  fair value measurements which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years  the adoption of asu  did not have a material impact on the fund’s financial statements  certain parts of the asu  are not yet effective  management is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of asu  will have on the fund’s financial statement disclosures           tax status the fund plans on qualifying as a regulated investment company “ric” and is planning on electing ric treatment when it files its tax return in   as long as the fund qualifies as a ric it will not pay any federal or state corporate income tax on income that is distributed to its shareholder passthrough status  should the fund not qualify as a ric or lose its qualification as a ric it could be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year even if that income is distributed to its shareholder and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to its shareholder as ordinary income  as of june   the fund had no uncertain tax positions  summary of investments   loans generally are made to borrowers pursuant to commitments whereby the fund agrees to finance assets andor provide working or growth capital up to a specified amount for the term of the commitments upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified by such commitment as of june   the funds investments in loans are primarily to companies based within the united states and are diversified among borrowers in the industry segments shown below  the percentage of net assets that each industry group represents is shown with the industry totals below  the sum of the percentages does not equal  percent because the percentages are based on net assets as opposed to total loans     the fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date that is an exit price the exit price assumes the asset or liability was exchanged in an orderly transaction it was not a forced liquidation or distressed sale   loan balances are summarized by borrower  typically a borrowers balance will be composed of several loans drawn under a commitment made by the fund with the interest rate on each loan fixed at the time each loan is funded each loan drawn under a commitment may have a different maturity date and amount    for the period from june   commencement of operations through june   the weightedaverage interest rate on the performing loan was   interest is calculated using the effective interest method and rates earned by the fund will fluctuate based on many factors including volatility early payoffs and recovery of interest from nonperforming assets   the loan as of june   is to a nonaffiliate and consists of the following industry classifications are unaudited               percentage of estimated fair par value final borrower net assets value   maturity date                     other technology         coulomb technologies inc      subtotal                          total cost of                               the loan was not classified as nonaccrual as of june   valuation hierarchy   the fund categorizes its fair value measurements according to a threelevel hierarchy the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used by the fund’s valuation techniques a level is assigned to each fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows                   level    unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date level    prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level    prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable   the fund’s cash equivalents were valued at the net asset value of the money market fund as a result these measurements are classified as level  the fund uses estimated exit values when determining the value of its investments  because these transactions are individually negotiated and unique and there is no market in which these assets trade the inputs for these assets which are discussed in the valuation methods listed above are classified as level      the following table presents the balances of assets as of june   measured at fair value on a recurring basis           as of june   level

                                  from june   commencement of operations through june      earnings per share basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net decrease in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted average common shares outstanding  diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net decrease in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted average common shares outstanding including the dilutive effects of potential common shares eg stock options  the fund has no instruments that would be potential common shares thus reported basic and diluted earnings per share are the same              management and related parties management fees as compensation for its services to the fund the manager receives a management fee “management fee” computed and paid at the end of each quarter at an annual rate of  percent of the company’s committed equity capital regardless of when or if the capital is called as of the last day of each fiscal quarter in a twoyear period commencing with the first capital closing which took place on june    following this twoyear period management fees are calculated and paid at the end of each quarter at an annual rate of  percent of the fund’s total assets including amounts derived from borrowed funds as of the last day of each quarter  management fees of  were recognized as expenses for the period ended june   related parties certain officers and directors of the company also serve as officers and directors of the manager  the articles of incorporation of the fund provide for indemnification of directors officers employees and agents including the manager of the fund to the full extent permitted by applicable state law and the  act including the advance of expenses and reasonable counsel fees  the articles of incorporation of the fund also contain a provision eliminating personal liability of a fund director or officer to the fund or its shareholder for monetary damages for certain breaches of their duty of care for this reason the fund has acquired a directors  officers insurance policy   transactions with venture lending  leasing v inc “ fund v”     the manager also serves as investment manager for fund v  the fund’s board of directors determined that so long as fund v has capital available to invest in loan transactions with final maturities earlier than december   the date on which fund v will be dissolved the fund will invest in each portfolio company in which fund v invests “investments”  initially the amount of each investment has been allocated  to the fund and  to fund v so long as fund v has capital available to invest  this percentage may be changed after the final close of capital at which time a determination of the percentage allocation will be made after february  fund v no longer is permitted to enter into new commitments to borrowers however fund v will be permitted to fund existing commitments  while investing the fund’s capital in the same companies in which fund v is also investing could provide the fund with greater diversification and access to larger transactions it could also result in a slower pace of investment than would be the case if the fund were investing in companies by itself     although the fund and fund v intend to invest in the same companies in the manner described above the fund may at any time with the approval of its board of directors i discontinue investing with fund v with respect to any or all future investments or ii choose to invest in different proportions with fund v than described above  in addition the fund has no control over fund v which is not required to invest with the fund in any particular proportion or at all and may choose to discontinue investing with the fund or to invest in different proportions than described in the preceding paragraph  in the event that fund v and the fund invest other than in the pro rata manner described above which can occur only with each board of directors approval the manager may have a conflict of interest in determining which of fund v and the fund will invest in a particular company and if both in what proportions  the fund may also engage in loan transactions with or make equity investments in companies that are preexisting borrowers from fund v or its predecessor funds   to the extent that clients other than fund v advised by the manager but in which the manager has no proprietary interest invest in opportunities available to the fund the manager will allocate such opportunities among the fund and such other clients in a manner deemed fair and equitable considering all of the circumstances in accordance with procedures approved by the fund’s board of directors including a majority of the disinterested directors intercreditor agreements   in each transaction in which both the fund and fund v invest it is expected that the fund and fund v will enter           into an intercreditor agreement pursuant to which the fund and fund v will cooperate in pursuing their remedies following a default by the common borrower  generally under such intercreditor agreements each party would agree that its security interest would be treated in parity with the security interest of the other party regardless of which security interest would have priority under applicable law  accordingly proceeds realized from the sale of any collateral or the exercise of any other creditor’s rights will be allocated between the fund and fund v pro rata in accordance with the amounts of their respective investments  an exception to the foregoing arrangement would occur in situations where for example one of the lenders financed specific items of equipment collateral in that case usually the lender who financed the specific assets will have a senior lien on that asset and the other lender will have a junior priority lien even though they may ratably share liens of equal priority on other assets of the common borrower  as a result of such intercreditor agreements the fund may have less flexibility in pursuing its remedies following a default than it would have had there been no intercreditor agreement and the fund may realize fewer proceeds  in addition because the fund and fund v invest at the same time in the same borrower such borrower would be required to service two loans rather than one  any additional administrative costs or burdens resulting there from may make the fund a less attractive lender and may make it more difficult for the fund to acquire such loans  capital stock as of june   there were  shares of  par value common stock authorized and  shares issued and outstanding  total committed capital of the company as of june   is  million  total contributed capital to the company through june   was  million of which  million was contributed to the fund  subsequent to quarterend additional commitments of capital to the company in the amount of  million were received see note  the chart

the end of each year dependent upon the fund’s current year and cumulative earnings and profits   financial highlights accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require disclosure of financial highlights of the fund for the periods presented  the total rate of return is defined as the return based on the change in value during the period of a theoretical investment made at the beginning of the period  the total rate of return assumes a constant rate of return for the fund during the period reported and weights each cash flow by the amount of time held in the fund  this required methodology differs from an internal rate of return the ratios of expenses and net investment income to average net assets calculated below are not annualized and are computed based upon the aggregate weighted average net assets of the fund for the periods presented  net investment income is inclusive of all investment income net of expenses and excludes realized or unrealized gains and losses           beginning and ending net asset values per share are based on the beginning and ending number of shares outstanding  other per share information is calculated

obligation to update or revise publicly any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise   general   the fund is  owned by venture lending  leasing vi llc the “company”  the funds shares of common stock  par value were sold to its shareholder under a stock purchase agreement  the fund has issued  of the fund’s  authorized shares  the funds shareholder may make additional capital contributions to the fund   in addition to the historical information contained herein this quarterly report on form q contains certain forwardlooking statements  the reader of this quarterly report should understand that all such forwardlooking statements are subject to various uncertainties and risks that could affect their outcome  the funds actual results could differ materially from those suggested by such forwardlooking statements  factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to variances in the actual versus projected growth in assets return on assets loan losses expenses rates charged on loans and earned on securities investments and competition  this entire quarterly report should be read to put such forwardlooking statements in context and to gain a more complete understanding of the uncertainties and risks involved in the funds business   overview   the fund is a financial services company primarily providing financing and advisory services to a variety of carefully selected venturebacked companies primarily located throughout the united states with a focus on growth oriented companies  the fund’s portfolio is expected to become well diversified and consists of companies in the communications information services media and technology including software and technologyenabled business services biotechnology and medical devices industry sectors among others  the fund’s capital is generally used by our portfolio companies to finance acquisitions of fixed assets andor for working capital  on june   the fund completed its first closing of capital made its first investments and became a nondiversified closedend investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the investment company act of   the fund intends to elect to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company “ric” under the internal revenue code with the filing of its federal corporate income tax return for either  or   pursuant to this election the fund generally will not have to pay corporatelevel taxes on any income it distributes to the stockholder as dividends allowing the fund’s shareholder to substantially reduce or eliminate its corporatelevel tax liability   the fund will seek to meet the ongoing requirements including the diversification requirements to qualify as a ric under the internal revenue code  if the fund fails to meet these requirements it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year even if that income is distributed to the company and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to the members of the company as ordinary income thus such income will be subject to a double layer of tax  there is no assurance that the fund will meet the ongoing requirements to qualify as a ric for tax purposes             the funds investment objective is to achieve a superior risk adjusted investment returns  the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by providing debt financing to portfolio companies  since inception the funds investing activities have focused primarily on private debt securities  the fund generally receives warrants to acquire equity securities in connection with its portfolio investments  the fund generally distributes these warrants to its shareholder upon receipt  the fund also has guidelines for the percentages of total assets which will be invested in different types of assets   the portfolio investments of the fund will primarily consist of debt financing to venture capital backed technology companies  the borrower’s ability to repay its loans may be adversely impacted by a number of factors and as a result the loan may not fully be repaid  furthermore the fund’s security interest in any collateral over the borrower’s assets may be insufficient to make up any shortfall in payments   critical accounting policies we identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial statements depend and determined the critical accounting principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  the two critical accounting policies relate to the valuation of loans and treatment of nonaccrual loans     loans are held at estimated fair value as determined by management in accordance with the valuation methods described in the valuation of loans section of note  of the fund’s financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  critical factors in determining the fair value of a loan include payment history collateral position financial strength of the borrower prospects for the borrowers raising future equity rounds likelihood of sale or acquisition of the borrower and length of expected holding period of the loan as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment  the actual value of the loans may differ from managements estimates which would affect net income as well as assets results of operations –for the period ended june     the fund did not commence operations until june   thus only data for  will be presented   total investment income for the period from june   commencement of operations through june   was less than  million which consisted of interest on the venture loan outstanding  interest is calculated using the effective interest method and rates earned by the fund will fluctuate based on many factors including volatility early payoffs and recovery of interest from nonperforming assets if any   management fees for the period from june   commencement of operations through june   were  management fees are calculated as  percent of the committed capital   total organizational cost for the period from june   commencement of operations through june   was  million  the banking and professional fees for the three months ended june   was less than  million  the banking and professional fees was comprised of legal and organizational costs   total other operating expenses for the period from june   commencement of operations through june   was less than  million   net investment loss for the period from june   commencement of operations through june
