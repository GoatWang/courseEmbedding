the post × how netapps ceo and his twin brother won the valley after they switched jobs julie bort jun    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print netapp ceo geroge kurian netapp the myth about identical twins is that they can simply switch places when they want to so that being a twin is like having a best friend and a clone wrapped into one for george kurian the ceo of netapp and thomas kurian oracles president of product development that myth is practically true they are literal doppelgangers who rose to the top with so much togetherness at one point they literally got up and switched jobs sending each of them on their current path to success george kurian was appointed ceo of  billion storage company netapp about a year ago after a fast meteoric rise at the company  thomas kurian has spent nearly  years at oracle he reports to oracles executive chairman and cto larry ellison and has even been rumored to be in line to become ceo when ellison fully retires sources close to thomas tell us he has ellisons ear because hes hardworking and smart and will challenge the geekatheart billionaire on technical product issues and tends to be right ellison loves a winner business insider recently met with george kurian to talk about his career his twin and how he plans to revitalize netapp a  billion company with  employees at a time when the business is facing major challenges a progressive indian mother raises four rambunctious boys thomas kurian oracle president flickroracle pr george and twin brother thomas are the youngest of four brothers george is technically older by a few seconds he laughs  the kurians were born to a selfmade business man in the scenic laidback beach and agricultural state of kerala india their dad was the son of a farmer who educated himself and became a successful in the manufacturing industry his mom was born to indian parents living in sri lanka she immigrated to india to go to college which was unheard of for a woman in that day george tells us we were all held in line by my mom she was loving but tough we were all raised with those christian values and she did things very different than most indian parents he says for instance with all boys and no girls she didnt follow the typical gender role stereotypes all the boys took turns in kitchen did house chores had to be responsible for clearing dinner doing everything required in the house he says she was famously strict in the neighborhood she would call the boys from their cricketinthestreet game at  pm and by  they had to have their hands washed and be at the table or they wouldnt get dinner he says it worked in addition to raising two multimillionaire tech execs her oldest son is a private equity investor in bangalore and the second oldest is a pediatrician in the uk george says  twin careers the twins moved to the us together to go to college at princeton earning scholarships to study engineering george kurian prepares meals during netapp’s executive chef day where an executive and a summer intern serve lunch to employees to raise money for the local food bank netapp it was a good thing that we came together it gave us a friend to navigate the big cultural transition between india and us he says while in college george worked any odd job he could to raise spending money parking cars working in the cafeteria being a pizza chef bartending you name it he says it taught me that it takes all kinds of people to make a business work george got a job at oracle straight from college and thomas landed as a consultant at mckenzie a few years later each of them wanted to try the others job so in  they switched george went to mckenzie and became a consultant and thomas went to oracle to be an engineer it isn’t that we intended to that it’s just that we both had good experiences and were interested in trying it out george explains matteroffactly i worked at oracle before he did and introduced him hes had a spectacular run there going on  years he notes george  moved to boston to work for internet network company akamai and met his wife in typical style thomas married a woman from boston too they even went to grad school earning their mbas at stanford together now both brothers live in the bay area george kurian getty images but the twins dont share an extravagant lifestyle that most other multimillionaire valley execs do no private plane for instance  if we got a private plane our mom would smack us down he laughs you cannot grow up in india without realizing that so many people have so much less than you have one more thing his mother doesnt let him do he cant act superior to his twin because hes a ceo when i told her that i was named the ceo she said great but we don’t carry business cards at home he says laughing at the story she constantly asks me if we’re being good husbands and fathers that brings you down to earth fast rise at netapp while thomas climbed oracles ladder george spent nine years at cisco netapps partner thats how he got hired away to lead netapps flagship storage management product ontap netapp was in a dire situation with ontap it had to be modernized into a clustering storage management product something the company had been working on for years not very successfully in the meantime competitors were eating its lunch overall revenues were sinking the company had more than one big layoff and morale was low netapp employees facebooknetapp george had no experience building storage products his background was in networking and servers and he took a lot of grief from his team for that i was reminded every day he says   he listened to everyones ideas and he also challenged people some people didnt like it and left the company he told the ones who stayed we’ve got to make this successful otherwise the company ceases to be relevant in storage and with the future of the company at stake everybody set aside their personal agenda and worked on it he says the product shipped and customers are buying it today it accounts for  of new shipments it was essentially zero when i joined netapp george says some customers have become downright fan boys the clustering technology means they dont have to schedule it downtime on nights and weekends to do their work ordering more layoffs now george kurian needs to carry the success he brought to the ontap group to the rest of the company  when netapps board asked year ceo tom georgens to step down in june  they made  george  interim ceo hiring him permanently a short time later netapp ceo george kurian screenshotyoutube george kurian joined netapp in  and was ceo four years later he had never been a ceo before he knows hes got his work cut out for him netapp is still shrinking at the start of this year he announced another huge layoff  of the company or  people  he called it an incredibly difficult decision and says he wants to fix the company so he never has to do it again  in december he bought boulder coloradobased allflash storage maker solidfire for  million in cash netapp desperately needed to get into the allflash storage market the new direction for corporate storage its late to this area but george has a comeback for that criticism being first to market is not necessarily the successful outcome violin and fusionio were first look where they are he tells us fusionio hit a tailspin a few years ago and was bought by sandisk in  violin memorys stock is currently trading for less than  netapp former ceo tom georgens netapp still netapp isnt out of the woods it reported a disappointing fourth quarter in may with a miss on profit and revenue and dimmerthanexpected guidance and theres endless speculation that its low stock price will make it an acquisition target its down about  from a year ago to about  likely buyer cisco says it doesnt want it kurian admits weve got a lot of work to do but he says hes also made progress in his first year putting in new leadership revamping business processes updating the products and buying solidfire he says its his job now to just execute thinking of his mother and brother he also knows says he must be humble about knowing you are not expert in all disciplines  see also one of ciscos star engineers defends the unusual way cisco paid him see also how the queen of silicon valley is helping google go after amazon’s

twins won the valley  business insider enterprise bi intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × how netapps ceo and his twin brother won the valley after they switched jobs julie bort jun    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print netapp ceo geroge kurian netapp the myth about identical twins is that they can simply switch places when they want to so that being a twin is like having a best friend and a clone wrapped into one for george kurian the ceo of netapp and thomas kurian oracles president of product development that myth is practically true they are literal doppelgangers who rose to the top with so much togetherness at one point they literally got up and switched jobs sending each of them on their current path to success george kurian was appointed ceo of  billion storage company netapp about a year ago after a fast meteoric rise at the company  thomas kurian has spent nearly  years at oracle he reports to oracles executive chairman and cto larry ellison and has even been rumored to be in line to become ceo when ellison fully retires sources close to thomas tell us he has ellisons ear because hes hardworking and smart and will challenge the geekatheart billionaire on technical product issues and tends to be right ellison loves a winner business insider recently met with george kurian to talk about his career his twin and how he plans to revitalize netapp a  billion company with  employees at a time when the business is facing major challenges a progressive indian mother raises four rambunctious boys thomas kurian oracle president flickroracle pr george and twin brother thomas are the youngest of four brothers george is technically older by a few seconds he laughs  the kurians were born to a selfmade business man in the scenic laidback beach and agricultural state of kerala india their dad was the son of a farmer who educated himself and became a successful in the manufacturing industry his mom was born to indian parents living in sri lanka she immigrated to india to go to college which was unheard of for a woman in that day george tells us we were all held in line by my mom she was loving but tough we were all raised with those christian values and she did things very different than most indian parents he says for instance with all boys and no girls she didnt follow the typical gender role stereotypes all the boys took turns in kitchen did house chores had to be responsible for clearing dinner doing everything required in the house he says she was famously strict in the neighborhood she would call the boys from their cricketinthestreet game at  pm and by  they had to have their hands washed and be at the table or they wouldnt get dinner he says it worked in addition to raising two multimillionaire tech execs her oldest son is a private equity investor in bangalore and the second oldest is a pediatrician in the uk george says  twin careers the twins moved to the us together to go to college at princeton earning scholarships to study engineering george kurian prepares meals during netapp’s executive chef day where an executive and a summer intern serve lunch to employees to raise money for the local food bank netapp it was a good thing that we came together it gave us a friend to navigate the big cultural transition between india and us he says while in college george worked any odd job he could to raise spending money parking cars working in the cafeteria being a pizza chef bartending you name it he says it taught me that it takes all kinds of people to make a business work george got a job at oracle straight from college and thomas landed as a consultant at mckenzie a few years later each of them wanted to try the others job so in  they switched george went to mckenzie and became a consultant and thomas went to oracle to be an engineer it isn’t that we intended to that it’s just that we both had good experiences and were interested in trying it out george explains matteroffactly i worked at oracle before he did and introduced him hes had a spectacular run there going on  years he notes george  moved to boston to work for internet network company akamai and met his wife in typical style thomas married a woman from boston too they even went to grad school earning their mbas at stanford together now both brothers live in the bay area george kurian getty images but the twins dont share an extravagant lifestyle that most other multimillionaire valley execs do no private plane for instance  if we got a private plane our mom would smack us down he laughs you cannot grow up in india without realizing that so many people have so much less than you have one more thing his mother doesnt let him do he cant act superior to his twin because hes a ceo when i told her that i was named the ceo she said great but we don’t carry business cards at home he says laughing at the story she constantly asks me if we’re being good husbands and fathers that brings you down to earth fast rise at netapp while thomas climbed oracles ladder george spent nine years at cisco netapps partner thats how he got hired away to lead netapps flagship storage management product ontap netapp was in a dire situation with ontap it had to be modernized into a clustering storage management product something the company had been working on for years not very successfully in the meantime competitors were eating its lunch overall revenues were sinking the company had more than one big layoff and morale was low netapp employees facebooknetapp george had no experience building storage products his background was in networking and servers and he took a lot of grief from his team for that i was reminded every day he says   he listened to everyones ideas and he also challenged people some people didnt like it and left the company he told the ones who stayed we’ve got to make this successful otherwise the company ceases to be relevant in storage and with the future of the company at stake everybody set aside their personal agenda and worked on it he says the product shipped and customers are buying it today it accounts for  of new shipments it was essentially zero when i joined netapp george says some customers have become downright fan boys the clustering technology means they dont have to schedule it downtime on nights and weekends to do their work ordering more layoffs now george kurian needs to carry the success he brought to the ontap group to the rest of the company  when netapps board asked year ceo tom georgens to step down in june  they made  george  interim ceo hiring him permanently a short time later netapp ceo george kurian screenshotyoutube george kurian joined netapp in  and was ceo four years later he had never been a ceo before he knows hes got his work cut out for him netapp is still shrinking at the start of this year he announced another huge layoff  of the company or  people  he called it an incredibly difficult decision and says he wants to fix the company so he never has to do it again  in december he bought boulder coloradobased allflash storage maker solidfire for  million in cash netapp desperately needed to get into the allflash storage market the new direction for corporate storage its late to this area but george has a comeback for that criticism being first to market is not necessarily the successful outcome violin and fusionio were first look where they are he tells us fusionio hit a tailspin a few years ago and was bought by sandisk in  violin memorys stock is currently trading for less than  netapp former ceo tom georgens netapp still netapp isnt out of the woods it reported a disappointing fourth quarter in may with a miss on profit and revenue and dimmerthanexpected guidance and theres endless speculation that its low stock price will make it an acquisition target its down about  from a year ago to about  likely buyer cisco says it doesnt want it kurian admits weve got a lot of work to do but he says hes also made progress in his first year putting in new leadership revamping business processes updating the products and buying solidfire he says its his job now to just execute thinking of his mother and brother he also knows says he must be humble about knowing you are not expert in all

june    pm edt printerfriendly version email this crn article george kurian storage vendor netapp on monday named a new ceo disclosing that tom georgens who has served for years as chairman and ceo has left the company in his place netapps board of directors has appointed george kurian executive vice president of product operations as the companys new ceo lead independent director mike nevens is netapps new chairman no reason was given for the departure of the year netapp veteran who has served as ceo since august  the company has been struggling of late last month reporting a drop in revenue and income a slowdown in its us commercial business and a drop in sales through the channel for its fourth fiscal quarter and said it plans to lay off about  employees over the rest of this year related netapp ceo georgens sees rebalancing ahead its no secret the brand is struggling so its not surprising its probably something that is overdue said stephen monteros vice president of business development and strategic initiatives at sigmanet an ontario califbased solution provider and gold level netapp partner on one end youve got emc who is very aggressive and strong and on the other side you have innovative partners out there like violin memory so they have to do something they arent winning on either side against those two and those two are on opposite ends when things are not working out and they havent been for a little bit you have to make a change to make a lasting change you generally have to start from the top and it will filter down from there monteros whose company has been a netapp partner for the past five years says hes glad to see the move because he says it is better to do something than to continue to watch the company deteriorate kurian may not necessarily lead sunnyvale califbased netapp longterm as the company plans to conduct a ceo search nevens said in a statement while we intend to conduct a ceo search we have the utmost confidence in georges ability to lead the company given his deep knowledge of netapp and support from a strong executive team george has deep relationships with customers and partners globally and is committed to strengthening those relationships going forward on behalf of the board and everyone at netapp i sincerely thank tom for his many valuable contributions over the past  years nevens said in the statement john woodall vice president of engineering at integrated archive systems ias a palo alto califbased solution provider said it was interesting that georgens should be leaving netapp the same day cisco announced a number of top executives will leave that company its bloody monday in silicon valley woodall told crn kurian is an incredibly smart person and has a very strong presence and charisma woodall said as head of operations george has been more aggressive on timelines he said things coming from netapp in the near future are coming from him and his teams while georgens has done well at netapp it is no surprise that the vendor may be looking for a change in leadership woodall said as a company it hasnt been growing its topline revenue he said youd expect some changes but wow
