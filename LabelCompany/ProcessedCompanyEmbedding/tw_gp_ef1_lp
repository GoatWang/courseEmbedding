for canon ef mm fl is ii usm lensdont mistake this as merely a thirdparty replacement foot  in many ways its better than the canon foot that came with the lens it makes so much more sense to have the foot be arcatype compatible so you can mount it directly to the tripod quick release rather than needing to screw on an additional quick release plate like you do with the oem foot the only reason i deducted a star is  price is a bit steep  i wish the slot for attaching the strap was toward the back of the foot rather than at the front the way it is now because its so far forward the center of balance is way off when you carry the lens  camera by the strap  this foot is rather low profile which is good in terms of portability and keeping the center of gravity low when mounted on the tripod  but that also means theres not a lot of room between the foot and the lens if youre the type like me who likes to carry the lens by the foot even with fairly skinny hands and fingers i have trouble

questions that need answers  my posts type in your question well look for answers cancel browse  questions and  answers hide answersshow all answers  sort by best questionmost answersfewest answersmost recent questionoldest question is it easy to hold the lens using this foot its awkward to carry the lens using the original lens foot without adding a longer lens plate eric p on sep   best answer in my experience it depends on how you position your hand on the canon lens foot and whether the foot is rotated from bottom of lens to top of lensmethod i am right handed so tend to carry with my right hand with the canon foot i carry with the camera body facing forward and the lens pointing behind me this way i can get two fingers under the foot between lens and foot to cradle the foot and my thumb then presses on the back of the foot to lock my grip in place the back of the foot is flush with nothing jutting outmethod if i reverse this and have the lens pointing forward with camera at rear if feels less secure with just two fingers cradling the lens i try to stuff my little finger at the back of the foot to lock the grip but find this does not feel as relaxed and secure as method with the kirk foot there is more metal sticking out behind the foot the canon foot is flush and this offers more to grab onto bottom lens position and therefore provides a more secure grip if you rotate the ring so that the foot is at the top of the lens then both lens feet tend to be a bit limited in that the pentaprism bulge on the camera body doesnât allow my large fingers to grip the foot securely the kirk rear flange sits closer to the pentaprism housing than the angled and flush rear section of the canon footgenerally the way i hold this combo the kirk foot offers a better more relaxed carry i only tend to carry for short periods and i suspect that carrying for longer periods could be a little uncomfortable unless you have a long plate attached and the foot is at the bottom of the lens reply · report · dennis s on sep    hide answers · add answer · i have this question too  vote for the best answer if you mean hold using the kirk adaptor as a handle to pick up or carry the lens walking around say then the answer is yesi do this all the time and it feels comfortable and sturdy if you mean hold as in handhold while shooting then of course all you have to do is rotate the lens collar so the tripod foot is out of your way in general the kirk foot is far better than the canon foot that comes with the lens especially when using the lens on a tripod reply  ·

answer · i have this question too  vote for the best answer the canonsupplied foot on the  ii does not work with an arcastyle clamp you can either buy a plate many different suppliers to attach to the bottom of the canon foot or you can buy the rrs or kirk replacement foot which has the appropriate plate built in i chose the latter a kirk lp after trying a plate attached to the canonsupplied foot i found when carrying the mounted lens on tripod over my shoulder for a time the thumbscrew on the foot tended to loosen with attendant stability and security problems the replacement foot is a much better solution and no canon does not make a replacement foot with the arcastyle plate built in replytcasqfzqrt · report · merle g on oct    the foot that comes with the mm is ii doesnt have the grooves in the sides to work with the swissacra clamp i replaced mine with this kirk plate and it has worked very well it is better than just attaching a plate to the bottom of the existing foot reply · report · doug r on oct    no they do not the canon foot is not designed to fit an arcaswiss plate very well the best option if you want to mount lens on arcaswiss is to purchase a rdparty foot like the kirk which is excellent reply · report · john c on oct    yesit fits very well solid fit with arcade swiss style mount lp replacement foot for canon ef mm fl is ii usm lens replytcasqfzqrt ·

but i like mine to really pop so i adjusted the blade axial pivot screw with a t torx driver till i got it where i wanted it not really necessary but ive been a mechanic for  years and cant resist the

purchase reviewstop customer reviews out of  starscreative renaissance brings sting back to basicsbykevin caffreyon november  format mp musicverified purchaselisten closely to the opening guitar riff of lead track i cant stop thinking about you and you can hear the echoes of the polices synchronicity ii a smile should then cross your face as you realize youre in for a real treat  a new sting album that is probably his best traditional one sinceten summoners tales sting seems more at ease with delivering a poprock album as its being promoted in light of recent work ranging from an interesting but littleheard broadway musical soundtrack the last ship amazon exclusive super deluxe edition to the headscratching middleoftheroad offering symphonicities than he did with his last two  brand new day and sacred love these two albums suffered perhaps from sting trying too much to branch out into current pop trends new country rb dance etc but here sting sticks to what has proved to be his bread  butter  strong songwriting coupled with really catchy melodies you cant get much better choruses than the title track down down down and petrol head in another decade these three songs would be top  hits those days may be over but itd be hard to deny that these songs are just as strong as his best solo work down down down is especially great with uncharacteristically vulnerable lyrics and vocals here comes the sound ive never heard beforethe sound that tells me when youre walking out my door one fine day reminds listeners that perhaps neil finn is not the only legendary songwriter still capable of writing  minute clever pop songs just as strong as their classic work and sounding like they didnt even break a sweat in the process the first  the album at its heart is sting and longtime guitarist dominic miller and drummer vinnie colaiuta banging through some very good rock songs the last third slows down a bit and recalls more of stings esoteric solo work the energy clearly shifts beginning with the dylanesque heading south on the great north road the best track on the album may be the haunting if you cant love me which recalls i burn for you from the police days i can picture this a song that  or  years from now will be turned into a hit for an artist like adele i wish inshallah would pick up a bit at the end to pack perhaps a greater emotional punch but it and closing track this empty chair make for a calm quiet end to a very strong albeit short album combined with a lot of strong material from the last ship soundtrack as well as the incredible recent tour with peter gabriel its great for a life long fan to see sting having a burst of creativity that seems to have been missing throughout the s happy for him  grateful  years later hes still providing his fans great musicread more comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsthe king of pain removes his hairshirt for one fine daybywhipitgoodon december  format audio cdverified purchasesting at his best is soulful sincere charismatic humble and above all honest he still speaks his mind here as always but he does it in a palatable way making the listening experience joyful rather than a drudgery theres still a bit of gloom and doom around but he does a good job of preventing his darker impulses from engulfing his good nature one of lifes bitter ironies is that being intelligent may give you the ability to see problems but not necessarily the skill or the resources to solve them and intelligence may give you the ability to catch a glimpse of perfection but that doesnt necessarily mean that its within your reach so sting gets the blues as many of us do but on this record he seems to have recovered his mojo this is wellcrafted but not overwrought it has the feel of a loose jam record similar to regatta de blanc but obviously more mature and poporiented sting has spent many years chasing after esoteric musical ideas continually testing his own artistic bravery as well as his fans patience but this time around he stops worrying about what a serious artist might do and he just rocks many people and some musicians are incapable of rocking so to have a guy like sting come around and show us all how its done is great fun is he off somewhere flogging himself for selling out with this latest record when he couldve broken new artistic ground by fusing disparate instruments such as the tuba ukulele kazoo and pennywhistle into some bizarre opus perhaps but you know what theres nothing wrong with rediscovering melody harmony rhythm and so forth does tight rhythmic melodicsounding pop music lead you in the direction of the beatles yesthey wrote the book on this style of music so of course it does dont apologize for having a good time we werent put here to suffer you know and theres nothing wrong with plagiarism if youre plagiarizing your own work which he sometimes does to be successful in the pop idiom one must condense sophisticated lyrical and musical ideas with great force in such a way that discards the superfluous aspects but retains the essential elementsall the while blending the familiar and the experimental in various proportions to create something that is at once comforting but also vaguely challenging its a balancing act its a craft sting is great at it when he wants to be and its not something to be scoffed at or embarrassed about he has brought a lot of happiness to a lot of people i for one have been listening for over  years i have few regrets you wont either

you may ski watch football grow a garden and work on a s muscle car in your spare time why does sting have to turn out the same commercial stuff for our consumption sacred love was far from artistic suicide he gained a huge listening base he didnt have before he didnt pass off his olde english lute work as police tunes its really all music take it or leave it buy the stuff of his you like yet

return to rockbyjohn mon january  format audio cdverified purchasethis album marks stings return to a more rock  roll effort than weve heard from him in over a decade as a life long fan i can say there is some very good work on this disc the material has a very stripped down almost corner bar band kind of vibe with a real energy the band sounds better and tighter than ever stings voice is showing its age however with a much lower singing register and seemingly permanent gravel this album was recorded in a short period of time  on purpose unfortunately some of the material reflects this almost as if time was running out and they had to get more songs thrown together as i said there are some real gems on this disc the songs that are good are very very good  and the songs that arentwell they sound like it however overall i would recommend giving it a try at the end of the day this album is a new release from a truly brilliant musician and storyteller and it offers something

manufacturingunit process modelabstractas the growth in demand for sustainable manufacturing continues companies must begin to makeconscious decisions with regard to the sustainability of their products thus design and manufacturingengineers must consider economic environmental and social aspects simultaneously when developingproducts and process ﬂows the purpose of this research is to develop a sustainable assessment methodology to both improve the accuracy of existing approaches in identifying the sustainability impacts of aproduct and to assist manufacturing decision makers the methodology developed utilizes unit processmodeling and life cycle inventory techniques combining these approaches allows for conductingproduct sustainability assessment at the process level by quantifying a selected set of sustainabilitymetrics a demonstration of the methodology to assess three design alternatives for a bevel gear ispresented the developed methodology is capable of quantifying the sustainability metrics by aggregating information from the process level it was found that the various metrics require different aggregation methods from the manufacturing process to the manufacturing system level the generalapproach can be applied to aid the investigation of tradeoffs during the design decision making processfor a wide range of products  elsevier ltd all rights
