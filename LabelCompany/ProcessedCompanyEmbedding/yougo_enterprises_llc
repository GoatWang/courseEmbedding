 jul  via ups electronic mail and fax  brian pyatt presidentbnb tobaccobnb enterprise llc                                                        maple ave west vienna virginia adminbnbtobaccocom fax   warning letter dear mr pyatt  the center for tobacco products of the us food and drug administration fda recently reviewed your website httpwwwbnbtobaccocom and determined that your products listed there are promoted for sale to customers in the united states under section rr of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fdc act and intended for human consumption certain tobacco products including cigarette tobacco are subject to fda jurisdiction under section b of the fdc act  usc § ab  usc § rr as amended by the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco fda has determined that your website httpwwwbnbtobaccocom offers for sale cigarette tobacco section  of the fdc act  usc  defines “cigarette tobacco” as “any product that consists of loose tobacco that is intended for use by consumers in a cigarette”  we note that under the “pipe tobacco” section of your website you present graphic images of the product brands  aces the good stuff kentucky select and red river which are promoted or labeled as “pipe tobacco” however the overall presentation of these products strongly suggests that they are intended for use in a cigarette specifically in your “pipe tobacco” section of the website you promote these product brands for sale with cigaretteinjector machines or as part of rollyourown starter packages or starter kits which include tobacco cigarette tubes and a cigarette machine this presentation suggests that your products are intended to be used to make cigarettes with the cigarette machines and cigarette tubes with which you promote them because the overall presentation of your products which consist of loose tobacco suggests that they are intended for use in cigarettes they meet the fdc act’s definition of “cigarette tobacco”  fda has determined that several of your products are adulterated under section  of the fdc act  usc § b because you promote these products as modified risk tobacco products without an fda order in effect that permits such promotion additionally fda has determined that several of your products are adulterated under section  of the fdc act  usc § b or misbranded under section a of the fdc act  usc § ca or section aa of the fdc act  usc § caa you can find the fdc act through links on fda’s homepage at httpwwwfdagov modified risk tobacco product violations you describe a product that you offer for sale on your website httpwwwbnbtobaccocom as being light by referring to it as such in product labeling or advertising and adding the qualifier “light”  specifically our review of your website revealed that you offer for sale a product listed as good stuff gold described as “good stuff light…”  a tobacco product with a label labeling or advertising that uses the descriptor “light” “mild” or “low” or a similar descriptor is a “modified risk tobacco product” under section baii of the fdc act  usc § kbaii  under section a of the fdc act  usc § ka no person may introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any modified risk tobacco product without an fda order in effect under section g of the fdc act  usc § kg a product that is in violation of section a of the fdc act  usc § ka is adulterated under section  of the fdc act  usc § b because your website uses the descriptor “light” or similar descriptors for the above listed product this product is a modified risk tobacco product because this product is promoted for sale to customers in the united states without an appropriate fda order in effect under section g of the fdc act  usc § kg this product is adulterated under section  of the fdc act  usc § b flavored cigarette violations additionally our review of yourwebsite httpwwwbnbtobaccocom revealed that you offer for sale the following cigarette tobacco “ aces mint” “kentucky select mint” and “red river mint” which are purported to contain an artificial or natural flavor that is a characterizing flavor of the product section aa of the fdc act  usc § gaa provides                a cigarette or any of its component parts including the tobacco filter or paper shall not contain as a constituent including a smoke constituent or additive an artificial or natural flavor other than tobacco or menthol or an herb or spice…that is a characterizing flavor of the tobacco product or tobacco smoke as of september   cigarettes marketed and sold in the united states in violation of section aa of the fdc act  usc § gaa are adulterated under section  of the fdc act  usc § b section  of the fdc act  usc  defines “cigarette” as including “tobacco in any form…that is likely to be offered to or purchased by consumers as a cigarette or as rollyourown tobacco” loose tobacco intended to be used in cigarettes meets the definition of “cigarette” and therefore is subject to section aa of the fdc act  usc § gaa additionally section  of the fdc act  usc  states that “unless otherwise stated the requirements applicable to cigarettes    shall apply to cigarette tobacco” thus your flavored cigarette tobacco is adulterated under section  of the fdc act  usc § b if however your cigarette tobacco does not contain a characterizing flavor it is misbranded under section a of the fdc act  usc § ca or section aa of the fdc act  usc § caa as its or labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the representation that the products contain for example mint as a characterizing flavor of the tobacco products conclusion and requested actions the violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list you should immediately correct the violations that are referenced above as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the fdc act  it is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related promotional materials on this website or any other websites or media in which you advertise comply with each applicable provision of the fdc act and fda’s implementing regulations failure to ensure full compliance with the fdc act may result in fda initiating further action without notice including but not limited to civil money penalties notobaccosale orders
