update   on friday march   jerrick media holdings inc the “company” or jerrick” filed its first k completing its first full year as a publicly traded company this marks a pivotal moment in our company’s evolution that transcends the scope of a conventional shareholder letter instead calling for a broader communiqué that encompasses jerrick media’s genesis through its evolution to become a multimedia digital content publishing house built on its own proprietary technology and distribution platform   over the last few years many of our investors have watched our management team cultivate jerrick’s business model into a diversified and versatile enterprise focused on the emerging digital community revolution the underlying strategy shaping the design of jerrick was founded on the simple concept of business arbitrage creating profit from the simultaneous purchase and sale of assets evolving our pilot platform “forum” to “vocal” and the subsequent creation of digital social communities has provided opportunities for jerrick our contributors and our readers to benefit intellectually and financially   after building testing and installing vocal and its proprietary monetization and optimization tools our next step is the global implementation of the updated revenue producing components to the vocal platform within the next  days we anticipate that our vocal  version will have a significant impact on our business and corporate objectives our goal over the next year is to track over  million unique monthly visitors to our community sites with  million monthly page views  this month target represents nearly an eightfold increase over current levels and well above the five million unique monthly visitor threshold at which advertisers launch their major campaigns importantly with our multisource revenue stream business model based on digital arbitrage we anticipate achieving profitable growth in    as jerrick has evolved over the last two years so has our overall market opportunity in our september  announcement premiering a lindsay lohan fashion film as part of the jerrick media library we described jerrick as   “a disruptive alternative to the traditional as well as the contemporary media brands producing and distributing premium digital media across multiple platforms for all demographics but especially centered on  year olds the portfolio of brands rest upon a single creative and business architecture all verticals are overseen by the same team and ideology focusing primarily on revenue conversion as the premise behind all published material vintage styles are contemporized for a new audience…         back then our vision of the vocal technology was just beginning to materialize while i believed then that a distribution platform for content was imperative i soon recognized a much greater opportunity for the platform that has become the underlying focus of the company a rapid means for the monetization of content currently we believe there is very limited competition – other than perhaps mediumcom the only other institutional long form social platform of any material nature   it was at this point in late  that it became apparent to us that we would need to partner with a bestinclass next generation development group in order to create an unparalleled grassroots platform to distribute the content that my partner rick schwartz and his creative team were able to produce   in february of  we became a publicly traded company for essentially three principle reasons      it became apparent that to acquire real talent from a new generation of thinkers we would need to unite them culturally the prolonged financial crisis left many talented individuals jaded by failed private companies whose stock could not be accurately valued for those individuals a publicly traded stock would both create transparency in value and unite them in a singular goal the creation of tangible value          in the digital space the key to success is keeping your friends close and your socalled friendly competitors even closer nothing unites companies like common ownership that can leverage each others’ strengths          in the digital space most companies inflate metrics and investors more often than not accept them at their word part of the problem lies in the inability to be held accountable for private company statistics provided to investors jerrick recognizes its responsibility to provide reliable metrics to its shareholders and the public especially in light of its regulatory reporting requirements as a publicly traded company   after six months of vetting well over two dozen potential development teams we chose thinkmill as our collaborative partners in april of  the ceo of thinkmill boris bozic had this to say about the synergies that exist between jerrick and thinkmill   “we’re excited to have the opportunity to collaborate with jerrick they have a unique perspective on the intersection of content publishing and commerce which from a technology point of view especially is a dynamic and particularly interesting problem space i see this partnership starting with a new content management platform and extending to future applications that build on top of it”            boris was correct within the next  days we will be completing a nearly month development process implementing the applications that boris was referring to back in early  – delivering a saas product that is turnkey for scale and distribution of content to protect and strengthen intellectual properties we pursued the following vocal patent filings     ● first application filed on march    assigned us provisional serial no     ● second application filed on october   assigned us provisional serial no  and     ● as recently as q  concurrent with technology advancements system and method for creating editing managing and serving webbased content application number  has been updated   in addition to patent filings jerrick’s proprietaryuniquetrade secrets include   structure of the architecture  best of the best features built from the ground up no legacy issues user experience  millennials designing and creating for millennials speed  performance  infinitely scalable with no compromise to performance media rich community  organized long form social platform   as the design and build came together through  we were successful in securing funding to create an even more robust platform to accommodate a heightened corporate goal addressing an even larger consumer market  we raised approximately  million during    as noted in our march   press release with regards to key highlights there were a number of significant accomplishments during this “nosetothegrindstone” period in jerrick’s corporate history     ● streamlined workforce during second half of  through the automation of many of the companys procedures and outsourced collaborative relationships     ● validated a second of multiple potential revenue sources – presold advertising with release of two instudio developed digital web series – “baked” and “marijuana minute”     ● increased the number of trademarks and the size of content library     ● by november th we completed the migration of jerricks entire online media infrastructure from a conventional wordpress system to the robust vocal platform vocal is designed to maximize scalability speed simplicity adaptability and create an unparalleled user experience  bridging mediarich longform creative content and effective algorithmic monetization for content creators   we divided the company’s operations into two well thought out compartmentalized activities  highlevel advancements to our platform architecture and  content creation group one in collaboration with thinkmill stayed focused on the development design and implementation of the vocal product the other group generated thousands of tangible pieces of content drawn down from video image and written content owned by jerrick this group created the foundation for what would be the outreach process to the writing community and the initial  beta users the successful launch of the technology and the rapid adoption by the writing community is a testament to the reengagement of the content and the platform development groups with the two strategic activities culminating over the next  days the company’s energies and resources will shift focus to revenue production while audience scalability will take on an organic and algorithmic process that is inherent to our technology            as my partner said on the day of our launch november     weve created a simple way for people to get their voices heard in the overcrowded noise of the internet that goes hand in hand with an effective monetization strategy… vocal combines the ease of facebook scope of reddit and commerce of amazon all into one rich ecosystem optimized for content and commerce”  this was covered in techcrunch  as well as adweek    december  statistics compared to march  shows a marked increase in all trackable metrics with limited additional costs in particular we have activated four new website communities in the last three months and expect that number in addition to a number of other relative metrics to triple over the next  days       december       march     verticals web communities               unique visitors per month               page views per month               total bloggers signed up               average  submissions per day               average  published submissions per day                 current business stats   user device  mobile  desktop traffic source  search  social media geographic breakdown of users  us  europe   we have been fortunate over the development years to have a consistent source of high margin revenue that provided an important supplement to our working capital auctioning the guccione library acquired in   we had been conducting auctions through an inhouse effort until the fourth quarter of  at which point just prior to the vocal platform commercial launch we strategically reallocated our internal resources towards our core operations thereby outsourcing the auctioning of the physical contents of the guiccione and collectable library over the course of four months we partnered with everything but the house ebth the worlds premier online marketplace for estate sales to carefully plan the auctioning of over  digitals images over the next  to  years with the most valuable of properties to be sold in the final years of engagement   the most recent sales of individual digital images from the collection sold for  at auction copy right maintained by jerrick an increase of over  from the prior year ebth cofounder brian graves commented as we formalized our engagement in october              we are excited to host a curated auction from gucciones vast collection of personal and corporate ephemera that represents his lifes work from his days in the art studio to his time behind the camera this sale gives guccione fans from across the world a chance to bid on unique pieces that have been inaccessible until now   as stated in our form k for the  fiscal year we plan to continue to monetize the guccione library over time to supplement working capital by holding periodic auctions during the year through ebth several auctions conducted by ebth over the last  days continue to demonstrate the significant value of this library in the marketplace in addition to selling the physical items through this auction process tens of thousands of images are being scanned for the company’s digital ip library including videos rare celebrity photos vintage scifi and the thousands of guccione published images from the early first decades of penthouse magazine    as a nimble opportunistic publishing house jerrick has unique capabilities to leverage content into multiple media channels case in point we announced on april   the development of a television series based on the life of bob guccione and the women who defined him in collaboration with maven pictures guccione created longevity omni and was the inspiration behind our successful site filthy  in this tv series we are contributing access and use of our guccione library as well as our experiences as executive producers  jerrick will receive revenue from a production fee a percentage revenueshare and rights to the series post debut  while our time and financial contribution to this project will be minimal the impact to our brand library value and the potential increase in unique visitors to our community sites could be very meaningful  similar to our instudio developed digital web series baked and marijuana minute the ongoing opportunities for a guccione series through content snippets as well as ecommerce can be significant   i have long believed that content is becoming a perpetually tradable digital asset as our transmedia a ssets continue to grow with vocal as the anchoring content and monetization platform projects such as the guccioni tv series feed into our sustainable high quality long form ethos   in middecember  i commented in a press release   “our primary platform vocal is a content distribution platform and publishing hub engineered for creation and discovery spanning verticals in health sexuality science fiction the workplace pop culture and more aimed at connecting thoughtful and original articles with communities passionate about these topics vocal leverages the power of specific and dedicated audiences with a nascent content creation engine and effective monetization”   our technology has evolved exponentially since then during the last  days as efforts with our partner thinkmill to develop the vocal platform have accelerated the platform has started to take on a more predictable pace of growth surpassing our early goals set at the launch we have grown from the initial  beta users in november  to nearly  registered writers with over  published pieces of content this phenomenal reception led to a nearly threefold increase in monthly page views            as my partner and cofounder rick schwartz said in our march   press release    weve seen substantial growth in our digital metrics and do not see that slowing down in the near term our ecosystem of communities will eventually drive its own topical formation as more and more content creators feed into vocal and our rapidly growing audience its exciting and rewarding to witness the amazing reaction to vocal there are so many people out there with something to say and were thrilled to both give them a platform and reward them for their content   to provide more scope on the rapid growth and success of vocal’s network since launch i encourage you to explore each of our  sites on alexa com the premier amazonowned website traffic and ranking analytic company  on a comparative basis we are effectively competing with some of the best known brands despite having only just launched our vocal platform a few months ago our us  global alexa rankings have been increasing at a rapid pace  our current rankings for our two longest publishing community sites are beginning to rival longstanding industry giants  filthymedia is currently far exceeding the rankings of other well known sexuality sites rankings and is even catching up to playboycom  omnimedia is already ranked well above its chief competitor scifinowcouk    moreover vocal’s accessibility ease of use and thoughtleading developments have provoked a positive response in the digital content community here is an example of a direct consumer feedback   “no matter what you want to write about there is almost certainly a home for your work with jerrick media vocal lets you craft your article inserting photos and videos and affiliate links along the way then at the end you decide which magazine you’d like to submit to anytime i’ve reached out to their editor or other staff they’ve always been super helpful and responsive they’re also encouraging and offer helpful feedback basically it seems that their honest goal is to help writers succeed and that is a blessing”  matt cates  vocal contributor   the release of my white paper on vocal digital arbitrage and jerrick’s pivotal role in the field sec form k filing on november    has heightened awareness of vocal while introducing this new concept of digital arbitrage in and around the digital marketplacen   vocal is a nextgeneration longform publishing platform solving two critical issues faced by a growing number of creators who collectively publish over  million articles and blogs daily – how do i get my voice heard and how do i get paid – exposure and compensation vocal partners with content creators and influencers by paying them at the highend of a marketdictated perview basis as posts gain traction writers capitalize on the upside through vocal as well as their own traditional social media marketing unlike traditional media platforms and blogging sites vocal does not limit the upside of its community members   in addition we provide creators a highly sophisticated simple publishing platform that offers the most advanced richmedia tools and search engine optimization for maximum audience exposure to our visitors we offer an impressive experience of evergreen and timeless well written interesting content in a visuallyorganized fashion in a community focused setting to our advertisers and brands we provide the means to efficiently target market the most appropriate audience for their goods and services within our growing list of community sites   having addressed most of the key metrics to look for on a goforward basis the time has come again for jerrick to execute as we have done previously we will continue to provide a transparent business infrastructuremodel new and disruptive technology and above all a bestinclass work ethic in order to achieve our goal of building extraordinary value for our stockholders for years to come          jerrick media holdings inc jmdapk company profile
