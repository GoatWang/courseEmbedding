you should be aware that in the future the company may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation  the presentation of property ebitda should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items property ebitda is a nongaap financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed

with gaap  property ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry  property ebitda is included because management uses property ebitda to measure performance and allocate resources and believes that property ebitda provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude certain noncash and other items as exhibited in the following reconciliation and is presented as a supplemental measure of the companys performance management believes that adjusted ebitda provides investors with additional information and allows a better understanding of the results of operational activities separate from the financial impact of decisions made for the
