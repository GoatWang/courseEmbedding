eligible for a traditional ira you must have earned income and be less than  ½ years of age a traditional ira provides a way to save in a taxdeferred manner but there are annual contribution limits and potential tax deductions these limits and deductibility rules change so it’s important to work with a qualified advisor to assist in the decision making process often times employees change companies or careers and leave employersponsored retirement plans behind the process of consolidating these accounts into an ira is called a rollover roth ira to be eligible for a roth ira you must have earned income unlike a traditional ira you can contribute to a roth ira if you are  ½ years of age or older a roth ira provides a way to save in a taxdeferred manner and you can make taxfree distributions of contributions and earnings after age  ½ there are annual contribution limits and taxfree distribution rules you must follow so it’s important to work with a qualified advisor to assist in the decision making process portfolio risk assessment a portfolio should be designed to meet an individual’s retirement income needs growing a client’s portfolio is important but taking on unnecessary risk is not prudent it’s important to perform a risk assessment before constructing the proper portfolio during this process factors such as age time horizon tax bracket and income needs are taken into consideration income for life strategies with advances in healthcare many retirees are concerned about outliving their money our advisors develop income for life strategies to address these fears this process involves a thorough review of all expenses as compared to existing retirement income such as social security and defined benefit pension plans when developing an income plan our objective is to provide income to cover any shortfall as independent advisors we have access to numerous fixed income securities and various types of annuities which are designed to provide income for life required minimum distributions retirees with employersponsored retirement plans and traditional andor rollover iras are required to begin annual distributions after april st of the year following age ½ the required minimum distribution often called rmds must be taken by  of each year if the correct amount isn’t taken the irs imposes a  penalty based on the amount of the required distribution if you are still employed at age  ½ you are not required to take a distribution from an employersponsored retirement plan unless you are a  or greater owner of the company social security benefits planning when planning to begin social security benefits retirees must take many factors into consideration you can begin taking benefits as early as  but you can also defer your benefits until age  you must consider your life expectancy income needs employment and marital status when making this important decision today retirees are living much longer lives so it is important to maximize annual benefits while understanding the impact on each recipient’s lifetime benefits review of employer retirement offers when employers are forced to reduce their workforce many of them offer retirement packages to longstanding employees these offers typically involve severance pay and some additional benefits our advisors offer a complimentary evaluation of your retirement offer we understand this decision can impact the rest of your life so we offer candid feedback and sound advice evaluation of employer retirement plans many employers offer retirement plans to attract and retain their employees most retirement plans allow you to contribute to a taxadvantaged account through payroll deduction while some employers contribute on your behalf to encourage employees to save many employers offer a matching contribution having a retirement plan is important but many plans are underutilized due to a lack of employee education during the planning process we offer a complimentary review of your employer plan to make sure you are taking full advantage of the benefits being offered pension plan analysis pension plans offer annuity income options lump sum payments or a combination of these options pension plans can have a significant impact on a client’s retirement so it is important to incorporate this benefit into the comprehensive wealth management plan to make an informed decision it’s important to work with a qualified advisor when reviewing these options tax reduction strategies as you spend down your retirement accounts it is important to utilize a taxefficient distribution strategy many retirees have investment accounts which grow taxdeferred taxable and taxfree when consulting with retirees we often distribute income from a combination of these accounts to reduce your income lowering your income will lessen your federal and state taxes but it can also lessen the taxes on your social security benefits and lower your medicare part b premiums many of your birthdays have a financial impact on your life our advisors educate you about the rules and requirements associated with the following ages executive benefits planning to attract retain and reward executives many companies provide benefits which aren’t offered to all employees as an executive it is important to have a complete understanding of the benefits offered by your

and implement appropriate planning strategies our advisors seek to understand each executive’s personal goals and objectives after defining short and longterm goals we design a customized wealth management plan to pursue each stated objective upon mutual commitment to work together we implement each step of the plan as time progresses we are here to guide and assist in the execution of
