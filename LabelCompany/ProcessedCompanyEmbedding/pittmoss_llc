llcdec  qa with the founder of pittmosssometimes there is nothing more inspiring then revisiting the beginnings of a company those seeds of genius grit and passion are why we launched mont’s corner a blog to share insights and inspiration from mont handley the inventor and founder of pittmoss to kickoff the first blog post we wanted to catch up with mont and learn about the history and mission of the companycatch up with mont handley founder and inventor of pittmoss with our latest blog mont’s cornerpittmoss pm tell us a little bit about yourself what got you interested in gardening and horticulturemont handley mh my grandmother always had a big garden one of my earliest memories was laying out old newspaper on the soil surface around all of the tomato and pepper plants to keep the weeds down i always liked growing plants and saved money at my first job at the family icecream stand and bought a greenhouse at the age of twelvepm what inspired you to create pittmossmh while working at a nursery in the chicago suburbs i became aware of the environmental issues associated with peat moss production in wetlands i initially had the thought that someone should come up with an alternative to the truckloads of peat moss we sold every year once the thought struck that i could potentially use recycled newspaper as that alternative i began my experiments in an old handmedown food processor i think that machine sits on a shelf in the pittmoss board roomupdate it still doespm what do you feel is the company’s most important missionmh providing the very best sustainable growing medium that we can to commercial growers and home gardenerspm average consumers do not think much about what is in a typical bag of soil can you share some insight about why your gardening medium mattersmh there are very few products that are beneficial to the health of the planet and pittmoss is beneficial in multiple ways it replaces a product removed from wetlands is made from cast off resources that would end up in a landfill allows growers and home gardeners to use less resources and water while reducing the need for chemical controls due to it’s sterile naturepm pittmoss is a manufactured product can you explain why this is a benefit to the planet and gardenersmh since peat moss is a product taken from wetlands it will contain weed seeds mold spores and insect larva which will need to be controlled often times with chemicals as a manufactured product pittmoss is sterile and free of these pathogens so there is no need for the use of chemical agents also those peatlands are drained to prepare for harvesting so the plants and animals in those habitats are displaced while the peat bog which is a natural carbon sink becomes a source of major carbon pollutionpm pittmoss is made from recycled newspapers why did you choose this resource is it harmful at all we get this question a lot so i want to address itmh newspaper is a relatively clean source of cellulose and it is not harmful most people are concerned about the inks but most heavy metal inks were eliminated decades ago and replaced with soy based inks which are safe the earliest independent research focused on the effects of newsprint on the plant matter after putting the plant matter through a mass spectrometer no concerns were foundpm what properties make pittmoss so powerfulmh the dynamic growth plants experience growing in pittmoss is the result of the exceptional porosity water and nutrient holding capacity of the medium cellulose looks like straws or penne pasta under a microscope those hollow tubules act like reservoirs for those resources that the plants use as needed for extended periods while protecting the roots from excess moisture too much moisture on roots can cause root rot while too little will cause plants to wilt pittmoss is much more forgiving than other growing media as it allows gardeners or growers a few extra hours before wilt sets in if they forget to waterpm one of the biggest benefits of pittmoss is it’s ability to increase biological activity can you elaborate on thismh cellulose is either like protein shakes or candy for the microbes found in the soil it feeds their reproduction and activity which leads to exchanges of gases and all sorts of good things happening at the roots of plantspm what is the one thing that surprised you about the productmh i’ll admit to being surprised by a grower who hosted one of our earliest demonstration days after we built the proof of concept plant and were able to distribute more trial pittmoss he’d been growing a very large crop in pittmoss and reported to the other commercial growers who had been invited that they were using  less water in their operations he said if his employees once watered twice a day they were only watering once a day even though i knew the water retention was better it was a great surprise to hear another independent voice highlight that benefit of the productpm what do you hope pittmoss can accomplish in the next five yearsmh i’d like to see pittmoss take a significant share of the commercial horticulture market and see a majority of landscape plants being grown in it if one of the major big box retailers takes a stand to protect peatlands then pittmoss is one of the few alternatives that can scale to meet that resulting needsharenever miss a story from pittmoss llc when
