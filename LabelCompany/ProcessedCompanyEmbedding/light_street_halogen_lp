fluorescents and led bulbs can drastically reduce your energy costs and help protect the environment selecting the right bulb incandescent incandescent bulbs which provide most home lighting are used in products from nightlights to floodlights the most common incandescent is a pearshaped a bulb with a mediumsized screwtype base incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot producing light about  percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat this style typically burns for  to  hours halogen halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with halogen gas which emits a bright white light long life and full spectrum halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage the life of these bulbs is around  to  hours or two to five years linear fluorescent linear fluorescent bulbs also known as fluorescent tubes are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they dont produce much heat these are the thin long tube lights often found in kitchens for undercabinet lighting or in garages workshops and basements the tubes can last from  to  hours— to  times longer than incandescent lights fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts compact fluorescent compact fluorescents also known as cfls provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just onefourth of the energy for example a watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a watt incandescent bulb compact fluorescent bulbs last about  hours— times longer than incandescent bulbs high intensity discharge high intensity discharge or hid bulbs include metal halide high pressure sodium and mercury vapor lights as their name implies hid bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power they are a mainstay of parking lot street and warehouse lighting like fluorescent bulbs hid bulbs also require a ballast stage and studio stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography studio traditionally these bulbs have used halogen or hid technology though led stage lights are becoming more common miniature indicator miniature indicator bulbs are found in everything from heavy machinery to instrument panels though we carry hundreds of miniature bulbs you can find the replacement you need by identifying the numeric code stamped on the base of your old bulb automotive automotive bulbs include everything from halogen headlight capsules to the tiny incandescent bulbs that go in makeup mirrors and everything in between no matter the make or model of your car we have the bulb that fits commercial lighting

light bulb with  pins on their base mr light bulbs are available in both low voltage  volts and line voltage  volts like mr light bulbs mr light bulbs are often listed by a  letter code called an ansi code ie bab exn that identifies the bulbs wattage voltage and beam spread mr halogen light bulbs have become extremely popular for use in track lighting can lighting display lighting and landscape lighting mr lights bulbs have pins that are either mm or mm apart and they are available in a wide range of beam spreads r halogen light bulbs r halogen light bulbs are mm  diameter reflector style light bulbs with a gu base these bulbs are a  volt equivalent to ar light bulbs r halogen light bulbs offer precise beam patterns with no hotspots bt shape halogen light bulbs bt halogen light bulbs are primarily used as a replacement for standard incandescent a light bulbs they are used wherever one desires higher light output than is available from standard incandescents bt light bulbs have a medium standard light bulb base and are available with clear or frosted glass halogen ball lites halogen ball lites are decorative halogen globes with pins on the base they are  diameter and have pins mm apart they are used primarily on pendant lights or as a replacement for mrs where directional light is not desired low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are great alternatives to halogen light bulbs for virtually all applications almost all halogen bulbs may be replaced with xenon light bulbs low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are available in several base types including g gy g wedge rigid loop festoon minicandelabra e candelabra e and dc base bad there are several advantages to using low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs long life low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs last up to  hours compare the long life of low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs to halogen light bulbs usually rated for  hours and you will find that xenon light bulbs are both economical and convenient low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are especially useful in fixtures that are difficult to reach or hard to change easier installation handling halogen light bulbs with bare hands drastically reduces the life of the bulb unlike halogen light bulbs low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs may be handled with bare hands with low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs you will never again have to wear gloves or use cloth and paper towels to change your light bulbs tolerates unstable voltage low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs are less likely to burn out when exposed to unstable voltage this makes low voltage xenon bulbs especially well suited to marine applications where boats are notorious for irregular voltage uv rays unlike halogen light bulbs low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs do not emit uv rays this quality makes low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs ideal for use around sensitive fabrics and artworks low pressure in contrast to halogen light bulbs low voltage xenon light bulbs and line voltage xenon light bulbs operate under low pressure similar to incandescent if you dont see the lamp you need please email us at inquirylightbulbsdirectcom home faqs about us contact us shipping  returns privacy policy all products
