microsoft tcn  awards and recognitions all microsoft sites home hall of legends charity outreach about faq engineering awards outstanding technicalleadershipthis award recognizes an individual responsible for creating or directly influencing a visionary initiative through collaboration and technical leadership creating a breakthrough in the technology industry other  award recipients chuck thackercareer achievement microsoft design languageoutstanding technical achievement harry shum  outstanding technical leadership with the presentation of the outstanding technical leadership award the microsoft technical community network recognizes harry shum for his transformative impact on search development at bing in osd when steve ballmer handpicked harry shum to lead the thenstruggling bing search quality team in  shum considered himself a “surprising choice” as we shall see this faith in shum was well founded in relatively short order shum righted the ship and spearheaded a series of science and engineering enhancements that would turn bing into a viable consumer alternative with a rapidly increasing search query share in the us nevertheless when asked about his achievements shum downplays his role in typical leadership fashion he would much prefer the spotlight shine on his team “i think the bing search quality team has done a fabulous job putting search quality on a par with google over the past few years—actually beating google on a number of measures this achievement really belongs to the entire team” by his own admission shum had very little experience in running a largescale engineering team at the time ballmer reached out to him having earned a phd in robotics from carnegie mellon university shum joined microsoft research in  after two years in redmond he moved to beijing as a founding member of microsoft research china over the span of nine years he would climb the ranks starting as a researcher and ultimately rising to the role of managing director for the bythen renamed microsoft research asia msr asia—not to mention distinguished engineer of microsoft corporation during his ½year tenure as managing director shum became increasingly cognizant of the looming importance of search and online advertising this ultimately led shum to make an interesting proposal to yusuf mehdi who was then leading msn search and ads team “i suggested to yusuf that i would like to build a search team for him” recalls shum “we would essentially work for the search team in redmond but i would run it out of beijing by leveraging msr asia” it was an unusual proposition and mehdi boldly decided to go for it shum’s resulting search technology team stc set the tone for joint collaboration between search product team and msr that shum would continue in the future “it probably had some influence on steve’s decision to have me take on the search job” says shum the bing search development team in redmond numbered roughly  when shum assumed responsibility in  as corporate vice president shum laughingly notes that his lack of traditional software engineering experience probably made him “more bold” than other colleagues which was maybe both good and bad “it took me a couple of years to really learn a lot of the basics” he says “and i got very lucky because i had great support from my manager satya nadella and had some very strong direct reports” in particular he calls out technical fellow darren shakib instrumental in creating elements of the cloud infrastructure used by bing and later the entire company also gaurav sareen who ran the index serving team and is now one of shum’s successors as corporate vice president in search development shum knew that getting things on track at bing would mean reformulating their approach “we realized that search is as much a science problem as an engineering problem” he explains “you have to reformulate the search quality problem as a science problem or research problem” identifying search ranking as the crux of the search quality challenge the team collaborated with msr in pursuing a solution based in machine learning—essentially applying the problem to a sort of machinebased neural network this was different from the rulebased methodologies used by others in the industry at the time the ultimate result was fastrank initially proposed by chris burgess and his colleagues at msr redmond a machinelearning algorithm using boosted decision trees that reduced training time exponentially from a hundred hours to one and could be tuned for rapid experimentation another advancement was aether an experimental platform that enabled engineers to combine existing models and build on each other’s work more recently the bing team and msr asia together are bringing forth a new index serving system called tiger providing significant index serving performance improvement the overall list of collaboration examples between bing and msr implemented under shum’s leadership is too broad to describe in detail it includes the kirin store mobile search improvements smart motion thumbnail in bing video search active answers relevance measurement pskip web ngram services for broad research community and many more the results have been impressive using internal metrics and blind tests shum’s team came up with a formula for measuring and scoring search results according to shum their scores finally caught up with google about three years ago shum says he is now confident in describing bing as a credible consumer alternative to google it seems consumers increasingly agree according to comscore bing’s search query share is now  percent in the us more than doubled since its launch evidence can be found at bing it on bingitoncom a site offering an impartial comparison of search results between bing and google akin to the pepsi challenge blind taste tests in addition to these performance metrics shum points to his team itself as further evidence of success “i feel incredibly proud that we have built this very strong bing engineering team” says shum “over six years we have grown one technical fellow two corporate vice presidents three distinguished engineers and  partner engineers” although the tcn technical leadership award is a fitting and welldeserved testimonial to shum’s leadership he recently earned an even bigger endorsement at the conclusion of  steve ballmer once again tapped shum for a critical leadership role this time as executive vice president of microsoft’s technology and research group shum now oversees microsoft research as well as the company trustworthy computing group and technology policy group “my new charter is to drive the company’s overall technical direction with slt especially for the midterm and longterm” says shum “we are already building products in a  to month time frame so we want to look beyond  months into the future at msr we have the charter to look ahead even five or ten years to where all the technology is headed” shum says he is comfortable leaving his position at bing knowing his team is positioned to continue its great work and he leaves with a great deal of satisfaction in what was accomplished “i am proud of what we achieved as a team” he concludes “i am proud that we have built a very highquality search engine comparable to google and with differentiating features we have provided to society even to humanity a different voice than google” contact us terms of use trademarks privacy statement   microsoft steven shum  xzeres wind corp  zoominfocom steven m shum executive profile  biography

developer tools blogs  steve guggs guggenheimers blog menu steve guggs guggenheimers blog microsoft build  redefining business with ai and my new role ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ may  may   by guggs   comments share   today at build microsoft executive vice president harry shum who heads the ai  research organization talked about how ai is impacting society and how we are supporting developers to infuse ai into all their efforts if you missed his keynote i encourage you to watch it on demand he also talked about how ai will redefine broad sets of business processes across many if not all industries which in turn has helped me find my next mission within microsoft the thing that i am most excited about with this year’s build conversation is our ability to highlight how ai will impact developers and our ability to demonstrate both the platform to enable that work and how we’re using these capabilities to enhance our own products i encourage you to try out the ai technologies in your apps and solutions we think you’ll be surprised on what you can accomplish ai at build  for developers ai introduces changes to how software will be designed moving forward where generations of developers have focused on programming everything that the computer did future programs will get insights from the data and take predictive actions based on advanced algorithms machine learning deep neural networks dnn and a broad set of tools to continuously refine and optimize business processes and outcomes during harry’s build keynote he talked about some of the technologies within the microsoft ai platform that we are making available to assist developers these include updates to the broadest collection of cognitive services with a new video indexer service the cognitive services lab plus the ability to customize core cognitive services such as speech and vision building on last year’s conversational ai announcements we have also made updates to the microsoft bot framework to make developers more productive while developing bots introduced adaptive cards for cross channelplatform bot development the ability to publish to new channels and enabled the implementation of our payment request api  developers can also build a skill for cortana via the bot framework channel announced today these skills will run across cortana apps and new devices including the new harman kardon invoke speaker and the cortana skills kit is now available in the us with other regions coming to learn more about how developers are using cortana skills check out our video in addition some developers will want to use compute in the cloud to run their own models in azure we have made this easier by supporting the ability to run models on several cpus gpus and eventually fpgas harry has more details on many of these announcements in his blog post redefining business with your data compute and algorithms are critical to having a powerful ai engine but data is the fuel that makes that engine run at microsoft we are very fortunate to have a variety of unique data sets bing and linkedin provide a wealth of world knowledge while the microsoft graph provides a wealth of work knowledge including signals from office  dynamics and even devices when these data sources are combined with your data there is the potential for incredible solutions with cloud compute data ai platforms tools and algorithms developers have a variety of options for using ai within their products and solutions yet for many businesses even with these building blocks there will be significant hurdles to overcome ai expertise is in short supply compared to the significant demand business leaders often don’t recognize what ai is capable of how to apply it to their business and most don’t have the ai expertise to integrate ai into their business processes as harry mentioned ai has the potential to disrupt every business app and process in every industry across industries and departments like sales and marketing we are working with developers and businesses to avoid being disrupted by redefining their businesses with ai using our platform technologies data ai expertise and our long history in developing for enterprise needs we have been applying ai to our own business processes and needs with great initial success for example contacting customer support can be a difficult experience for many customers want solutions to their problems now in a personalized and convenient way agents are challenged to handle these broad range of questions across different channels to provide the best solution for the customer microsoft’s customer support services team uses our customer care intelligence solution to address this challenge applying ml and analytics to our knowledge bases including faq documents web pages and historical chat data we extract the knowledge required to effectively answer our customers’ questions conversational ai helps us answer in a personalized way using our bot and ai technologies we provide expedient selfhelp support to our customers or connect them to an agent augmented with the conversation context and aidriven content to better serve them to continuously evolve the system we used deep reinforcement learning to learn from each customeragent interaction another area of focus is helping our finance teams make the most informed decisions they can people have often turned to bing to help pick march madness world cup and oscar winners beyond sports entertainment and politics there are key business scenarios where powerful insights can impact a business’ bottom line microsoft’s treasury uses our market intelligence solutions to help manage our cash and shortterm assets institutional investors leverage our macroeconomic predictions to better inform their trades and investments we apply our ml algorithms for entity extraction sentiment analysis query understanding and more on aggregated and anonymized data from bing and the web to do forecasting financial predictions product reviews and more when world data is combined with workplace data and your business data incredible insights and associated actions can be enabled combining various signals from marketing automation crm bing linkedin and interaction patterns can help sales people quickly triage leads and accelerate closing deals computer vision can create safer work environments by identifying safety hazards before there is a problem there is a lot happening in this business ai space and we are just getting started we will have more to share in the future dx leadership changes with the advancements in ai and the opportunity to redefine businesses with ai i’m happy to use this build to transition into ai  research over the last  years i have had the good fortune to lead the developer evangelism group dx where we have worked with developers and isvs from around the world to help them leverage the incredible advancements in software and tools to deliver incredible new products solutions and tools for their customers and partners this journey has included interacting with students exploring computer science fast growing startups enterprise developers technical and business communities isvs and so many other interesting and thoughtful individuals over just the short time of this journey software development has changed significantly but the drive of developers to shape the world through software continues as microsoft accelerates its ai investments to amplify human ingenuity i look forward to seeing what charlotte yarkoni cvp john shewchuk technical fellow and ron huddleston cvp do for developers and isv’s as they onboard the teams that previously comprised dx it’s been a privilege running build for so many years i look forward to attending next year and hope you enjoy the day  keynote video from john shewchuk and i on channel  this friday but you can see the exciting trailer here now i’m looking forward to seeing what you

outstanding technicalleadershipthis award recognizes an individual responsible for creating or directly influencing a visionary initiative through collaboration and technical leadership creating a breakthrough in the technology industry other  award recipients chuck thackercareer achievement microsoft design languageoutstanding technical achievement harry shum  outstanding technical leadership with the presentation of the outstanding technical leadership award the microsoft technical community network recognizes harry shum for his transformative impact on search development at bing in osd when steve ballmer handpicked harry shum to lead the thenstruggling bing search quality team in  shum considered himself a “surprising choice” as we shall see this faith in shum was well founded in relatively short order shum righted the ship and spearheaded a series of science and engineering enhancements that would turn bing into a viable consumer alternative with a rapidly increasing search query share in the us nevertheless when asked about his achievements shum downplays his role in typical leadership fashion he would much prefer the spotlight shine on his team “i think the bing search quality team has done a fabulous job putting search quality on a par with google over the past few years—actually beating google on a number of measures this achievement really belongs to the entire team” by his own admission shum had very little experience in running a largescale engineering team at the time ballmer reached out to him having earned a phd in robotics from carnegie mellon university shum joined microsoft research in  after two years in redmond he moved to beijing as a founding member of microsoft research china over the span of nine years he would climb the ranks starting as a researcher and ultimately rising to the role of managing director for the bythen renamed microsoft research asia msr asia—not to mention distinguished engineer of microsoft corporation during his ½year tenure as managing director shum became increasingly cognizant of the looming importance of search and online advertising this ultimately led shum to make an interesting proposal to yusuf mehdi who was then leading msn search and ads team “i suggested to yusuf that i would like to build a search team for him” recalls shum “we would essentially work for the search team in redmond but i would run it out of beijing by leveraging msr asia” it was an unusual proposition and mehdi boldly decided to go for it shum’s resulting search technology team stc set the tone for joint collaboration between search product team and msr that shum would continue in the future “it probably had some influence on steve’s decision to have me take on the search job” says shum the bing search development team in redmond numbered roughly  when shum assumed responsibility in  as corporate vice president shum laughingly notes that his lack of traditional software engineering experience probably made him “more bold” than other colleagues which was maybe both good and bad “it took me a couple of years to really learn a lot of the basics” he says “and i got very lucky because i had great support from my manager satya nadella and had some very strong direct reports” in particular he calls out technical fellow darren shakib instrumental in creating elements of the cloud infrastructure used by bing and later the entire company also gaurav sareen who ran the index serving team and is now one of shum’s successors as corporate vice president in search development shum knew that getting things on track at bing would mean reformulating their approach “we realized that search is as much a science problem as an engineering problem” he explains “you have to reformulate the search quality problem as a science problem or research problem” identifying search ranking as the crux of the search quality challenge the team collaborated with msr in pursuing a solution based in machine learning—essentially applying the problem to a sort of machinebased neural network this was different from the rulebased methodologies used by others in the industry at the time the ultimate result was fastrank initially proposed by chris burgess and his colleagues at msr redmond a machinelearning algorithm using boosted decision trees that reduced training time exponentially from a hundred hours to one and could be tuned for rapid experimentation another advancement was aether an experimental platform that enabled engineers to combine existing models and build on each other’s work more recently the bing team and msr asia together are bringing forth a new index serving system called tiger providing significant index serving performance improvement the overall list of collaboration examples between bing and msr implemented under shum’s leadership is too broad to describe in detail it includes the kirin store mobile search improvements smart motion thumbnail in bing video search active answers relevance measurement pskip web ngram services for broad research community and many more the results have been impressive using internal metrics and blind tests shum’s team came up with a formula for measuring and scoring search results according to shum their scores finally caught up with google about three years ago shum says he is now confident in describing bing as a credible consumer alternative to google it seems consumers increasingly agree according to comscore bing’s search query share is now  percent in the us more than doubled since its launch evidence can be found at bing it on bingitoncom a site offering an impartial comparison of search results between bing and google akin to the pepsi challenge blind taste tests in addition to these performance metrics shum points to his team itself as further evidence of success “i feel incredibly proud that we have built this very strong bing engineering team” says shum “over six years we have grown one technical fellow two corporate vice presidents three distinguished engineers and  partner engineers” although the tcn technical leadership award is a fitting and welldeserved testimonial to shum’s leadership he recently earned an even bigger endorsement at the conclusion of  steve ballmer once again tapped shum for a critical leadership role this time as executive vice president of microsoft’s technology and research group shum now oversees microsoft research as well as the company trustworthy computing group and technology policy group “my new charter is to drive the company’s overall technical direction with slt especially for the midterm and longterm” says shum “we are already building products in a  to month time frame so we want to look beyond  months into the future at msr we have the charter to look ahead even five or ten years to where all the technology is headed” shum says he is comfortable leaving his position at bing knowing his team is positioned to continue its great work and he leaves with a great deal of satisfaction in what was accomplished “i am proud of what we achieved as a team” he concludes “i am proud that we have built a very highquality search engine comparable to google and with differentiating features we have provided to society even to humanity a different voice than google” contact us terms of use trademarks
