will have until  months from the closing of this offering to consummate our initial business combination however if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within  months we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to three times each by an additional three months for a total of up to  months to complete a business combination in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination our sponsors or their affiliates or designees must deposit into the trust account  or  if the

applicable deadline for each three month extension  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses the amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account based on the current interest rate environment we would expect approximately  to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over  months following the closing of this offering however we can provide no assurances regarding this amount this estimate assumes an interest rate of  per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for financing the rules of the nasdaq capital market provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants approximately  or approximately  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full including up to  or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will initially be placed in a trust account with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee subject to increase in the event that our sponsors elect to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working capital expenses which may include repayment of loans made to us by the sponsors or the application of withdrawn or accrued interest to the sponsors’ obligation to loan us money in connection with an extension until the earlier of i the completion of our initial business combination or ii the redemption of  of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within  months from the closing of this offering or up to  months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination as described in more detail in this prospectus subject to the requirements of law depending on interest rates interest earned on the trust account may not be sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of working capital expenses the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we have entered into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we will pay an affiliate of our executive officers a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial support upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees as of the date of this prospectus certain of our sponsors have agreed to loan us up to  in the aggregate to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of december   or the closing of this offering these loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account including interest permitted to be withdrawn as described herein in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account including interest permitted to be withdrawn as described herein to repay such loaned amounts but no other proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans including any loans made in connection with the extension of the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination may be convertible into warrants of the postbusiness combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants all other terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our business combination so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock that such shareholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering or up to  months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination as described in more detail in this prospectus following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination or iii the redemption of our public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering or up to  months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination as described in more detail in this prospectus from the closing of our initial public offering in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newlyorganized blank check company formed pursuant to the laws of the republic of the marshall islands for the purpose of acquiring through a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization recapitalization exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified we intend to focus our efforts on seeking and completing an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between  million and  million although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered while our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial business combination will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region we will initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the international energy logistics industry we do not have any specific merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization recapitalization exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction under consideration and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions formal or otherwise with respect to such a transaction we have assembled a group of directors including independent directors who will provide public company governance executive leadership operations oversight private equity investment management and capital markets experience our board members have extensive experience having served as directors ceo’s or cfo’s or in other executive and advisory capacities for publiclylisted and privatelyowned companies our directors have experience with acquisitions divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation which we believe will be of significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination we believe that the international oil and gas logistics land and maritime oil and gas transportation terminal and energy storage industries which we refer to in this prospectus as the “energy logistics industry” presents attractive opportunities for consolidation and growth and a favorable area in which to attempt to consummate a business combination our executive officers and directors have an aggregate of over  years of experience in the energy logistics industry as managers principals or directors of major worldwide maritime companies where they have sourced negotiated and structured transactions in these industries we intend to leverage the industry experience of our executive officers including their contacts and relationships by focusing our efforts on identifying a prospective target business in the international energy logistics industry while the amount of time our executive officers will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process the company is in we expect messrs tsirigakis and syllantavos to devote in the aggregate an average of approximately  hours per week to our business  our executive offices are located at  kifissias avenue maroussi  athens greece and our telephone number is    full description the ipo profiles may contain historical
