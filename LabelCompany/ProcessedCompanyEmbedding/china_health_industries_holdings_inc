value of financial instruments the provisions of accounting guidance fasb asc topic  that applies to the company requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheets for which it is practicable to estimate fair value and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties fair value measurements fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements various inputs are considered when determining the fair value of the companys debt the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below  level  observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level  other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates credit risk etc level  significant unobservable inputs including the companys own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs the company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared the company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a recurring basis during the reporting periods the availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument whether the instrument is actively traded and other characteristics particular to the transaction for many financial instruments pricing inputs are readily observable in the market the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants and the valuation does not require significant management discretion for other financial instruments pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment translation of foreign currencies humankind huimeijia and hlj huimeijia maintain their books and accounting records in prc currency renminbi rmb which has been determined as the functional currency transactions denominated in currencies other than rmb are translated into rmb at the exchange

humankind huimeijia and hlj huimeijias financial statements are translated into the reporting currency the united states dollar usd assets and liabilities of the above entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at each reporting period end date contributed capital accounts are translated using the historical rate of exchange when capital is injected income and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange during the reporting period translation adjustments resulting from the translation of these financial statements are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and noncontrolling interests  statement of cash flows in accordance with statement fasb asc topic  statement of cash flows cash flow from the companys operations is calculated based upon the local currencies and translated to the reporting currency using an average foreign exchange rate for the reporting period as a result amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and assumptions of future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and accordingly these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as the companys operating environment changes significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others useful lives of longlived assets and intangible assets valuation of inventory accounts receivable and notes receivable impairment analysis of longlived assets construction in progress intangible assets and deferred taxes while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the

costs included in finished goods include direct labor cost and other costs directly applicable to the manufacturing process the company evaluates inventory for excess slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory the value of which is in excess of its net realizable value this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand if future

companys longlived assets and other assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of the fasb asc topic  property plant and equipment and fasb asc topic  presentation of financial statements the company tests for impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such asset is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value impairment evaluations involve managements estimates on asset useful lives and future cash flows actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management which could have a material effect on the companys reporting results and financial position fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and thirdparty independent appraisals as considered necessary as of september   and june   the company had not experienced impairment losses on its longlived assets for both the continuing and discontinued operations however there can be no assurances that demand for the companys products or services will continue which could result in an impairment of longlived assets in the future property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are carried at the lower of cost or fair value maintenance repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred major renewals and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are capitalized when assets are retired or disposed of the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations in the reporting period of disposition depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the assets the depreciable lives applied are  building warehouse and improvements  to  years office equipment  to  years vehicles  to years machinery and equipment  to  years intangible assets the company evaluates intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct or if business conditions change purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required the value of the companys intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in the companys operating results ii a decline in the valuation of technology including the valuation of the companys common stock iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in the companys forecasts of future operating results in accordance with fasb asc topic  the company tests intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations it is possible however that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect if the companys actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period based on such evaluations there was no impairment recorded for intangible assets held for both the continuing and discontinued operations for the three months ended september   and  respectively construction in progress construction in progress represents the costs incurred in connection with the construction of buildings or new additions to the companys plant facilities costs classified as construction in progress include all costs of obtaining the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for its intended use no depreciation is provided for construction in progress until such time as the assets are completed and are placed into service the company reviews the carrying value of construction in progress for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results trends and prospects the manner in which the property is used and the effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors based on this assessment there was no impairment recorded for construction in progress held for both the continuing and discontinued operations for the three months ended september   and  respectively  revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is both earned and realized or realizable the companys policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the customer persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured all of which generally occur upon shipment of goods to customers the majority of the companys revenue relates to the sale of inventory to customers and revenue is recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer given the nature of the companys business and the applicable rules guiding revenue recognition the companys revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially affect the results of operations the company records revenue at the discounted selling price and allows its customers to return products for exchange or credit subject to certain limitations a provision for such returns is recorded based upon historical experience there has been no provision recorded for returns based upon historical experience held for both the continuing and discontinued operations for the three months ended september   and  respectively  cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of raw materials freight charges direct labor depreciation of plants and machinery warehousing and overhead costs associated with

issued fin asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no  asc  which requires income tax positions to meet a morelikelythannot recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements under fin asc  tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met as a result of the implementation of fin  asc  the company undertook a comprehensive review of its portfolio of tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by fin  asc  the company recognized no material adjustments to liabilities or stockholders equity as a result of the implementation the adoption of fin  did not have a material impact on the companys financial statements the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation the evolution of regulations and court rulings therefore the actual liability may be materially different from the

forces for economic reforms the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises a substantial portion of productive assets in the prc is still owned by the chinese government for example all land is state owned and leased to business entities or individuals through the governments granting of land use rights the granting process is typically based on government policies at the time of granting and can be lengthy and complex this process may adversely affect the companys future manufacturing expansions the chinese government also exercises significant control over the prcs economic growth through the allocation of resources and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies

europe since its assets exist solely in the prc and its revenues are derived from its operations therein the prc is a developing country with an early stage market economic system overshadowed by the state its political and economic systems are very different from the more developed countries and are in a state of change the prc also faces many social economic and political challenges that may
