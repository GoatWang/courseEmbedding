d weight  pounds msrp  usa     marsh sound design  el camino drive corte madera california  web httpwwwmarshsounddesigncom  introduction richard marsh is a veteran in the audio industry and you may very well have some of his other efforts in your system already  dr marsh is a world renowned expert on capacitors  some of his designs have received critical acclaim mit z series and monster cable hts power products and his multicap capacitors have gained widespread use by manufacturers worldwide  if youd like to see which manufacturers are using his current line of capacitors check out httpwwwcapacitorscom marsh sound design msd marks dr marshs first time around for marketing audio components under his own name  the current product lineup includes a solid statetube hybrid preamp plus several power amplifiers  plans are in the works for a home theater preampprocessor and multichannel amplifiers construction click on photos to see larger versions this amp is solidly built with silver faceplate and the almost ubiquitous blue power led  its moderately heavy at  pounds and is square in footprint  there are no handles nor is there provision for rack mounting as shipped from the factory  the end pieces of the amplifier do have sufficient clearance from the heat sinks for your hands to pick up and carry the amp if necessary the rear panel also shows solid construction including dual binding posts for quick and easy biwiring of your speakers if theyre biwire capable  selection of singleended rca or balanced xlr operation is performed by a switch on each channel and the posts are fairly substantial  power cord tweakers take note this amp has a detachable power cord  feel free to substitute the cord of choice in your system      when you open the chassis the detail and care in assembly remain evident  note the symmetry between the left and right halves of the amplifier as viewed from above you can click on the photos for larger view  shared components are limited to the power input at the rear of the chassis the toroidal transformer and the front panel power circuitry  six motorola bipolar fets are used per channel as well as nichicon capacitors  also included is a power filter integrated into the power supply so that even those without line conditioning should enjoy excellent performance from this amplifier listening to the amplifier whenever a new piece of gear goes into my system theres an initial rush of excitement that comes from the novelty of sonic differences and the pleasure of having a new toy  when listening to any new product if there is something that sticks out as noticeably unpleasant then i might not be happy with it in the long run  to me it indicates something is out of balance with the as nothing really struck me out of the box as being out of place there were a few things that showed up the more i listened  first and foremost this amplifier is capable of retrieving incredible detail from recordings  for a lot of the jazz recordings that i enjoy its the subtleties of sticking differences a drummer will use on cymbals trumpet valve noises or saxophone key clatter that arent noticeable on lower resolution systems  my reference for this is the dave brubeck recording tritonis which has jerry bergonzi on tenor sax a personal favorite of mine  track  like someone in love ends with an extended obligatto by bergonzi  hes all over his horn  at times almost whispering while at other times hes loud and forceful  during the quiet passages with the as the clatter from his keys is a bit more pronounced than ive heard before  during furious passages with sheets of notes flying off of his sax the amp still manages to point out that these sheets are made up of many individual notes in rapid fire succession   the sound of his horn has the appropriate combination of stridency and body that is his signature sound next up was a relatively new recording to me and the only recording that actually made this amp overload at high volumes  percy grainger works for wind orchestra    my speakers arent noted for their efficiency and about  or so into irish tune from county derry  when the pipe organ kicks in with the orchestra playing fortissimo i managed to get the amplifiers protection circuitry to engage  the amplifier automatically muted input and waited a few seconds as i frantically hit the volume down  i dont know how loud the room was at this point but i detected only a modest sense of strain just prior to shutdown  ten to fifteen seconds later the amplifier came  back on and continued playing with none the worse for the wear  i listened to several tracks for reviewing and it was nice to hear the amplifier retaining the characteristics of individual instruments without losing the cohesiveness of the group percussion xylophone in particular rang out with sharpness and clarity characteristic of a live performance   lesson learned if you have inefficient speakers dont expect concert hall levels from this amp look at the monoblocks model am or am   according to msd theyll be out in the fourth quarter of  im not a huge soundstage junkie but i tend to focus on musical details  my gauge for soundstage width is another acoustic jazz album led by trumpeter tom harrell  the recording is upswing and i used the title cut  on an amp with good soundstage width you can hear phil woods alto from beyond the left speaker and joe lovanos tenor beyond the right speaker  this amp compressed the soundstage so that the saxes are much closer to the trumpet than my reference  i also noticed that the amp is providing me with just the facts without embellishment coloration or detraction imperfections   my biggest concerns have nothing to do with the sonics of the amplifier but rather with the warranty  in comparison to others in its price range the two year warranty is a bit short  given the parts and construction quality im surprised that it isnt longer  perhaps marsh sound design will address this in the future as his company grows the first review sample developed a power supply problem about  days after receipt  after contacting the folks at msd the review sample was returned and a replacement was sent after a bit of a delay  my second sample was fine and all referenced listening was done with this second amplifier conclusion richard marsh has designed a solid amplifier capable of holding its own against other amplifiers in its price range  this amplifier recovers tremendous detail with a straightforward uncolored presentation  combined with the quiet background youve got a fine effort from marsh sound design  it is well worth a serious listen if your stereo amplifier budget is near or slightly above this price range  like many of its competitors this amp isnt capable of doubling down its output power into a  ohm load  for real world listening i didnt find this to be a problem in my system associated equipment used for the review

reviews law office of john p keirnanepicnerdfail ratedcasey is a great attorney andcasey is a great attorney and even broke down the legal jargan and explained to me what everything meant in regards to my misdemeanor charge it was very comforting since id never been in trouble before well it was until the one time my father also an attorney but of a different sort was not able to go to my court date with me mr keirnan didnt even bother to tell me that he wasnt going to show up at the beginning like i had to even though he had always been there from the start of court before i sat in the court room for  hours wondering where my attorney was and why i couldnt get an answer from him or his office as to what was going on finally my father who was on vacation decided to call casey and immediately got the answer he had other court appearances to make as well and attended those first apparently since my dad wasnt around by the time casey made it to the court room  hours after the session began the judge had gone home sick for the day since my court date kept getting reset i had to go a couple more times before it was settled in that time i tried to call mr keirnan in regards to my case with a question but he could never be bothered to return my calls only my fathers i guess even though i was his client he was simply too good to talk to me he chose to go through my father and only took time to make sure i understood what was happening when my father was around it was all for show yes he did his job and i have no complaints as to the results i just dont like the fact that i paid that much money to a man who couldnt even call me back about my case now that i am getting my record sealed i am going through the same bs with a lady in his office who handles nondisclosures and expunctures all the time i am downright pissed off at this point and regret ever going to this practice to begin with thanks to this lady my entire life is on hold still because she has yet to file the papers three weeks after cashing the check for payment in full she knows this also so i she either does not care or is incapable of finding out when the right time of day is to file the papers not very reassuring for someone who does this kind of thing all the time technically i could have had my record sealed two weeks ago but she cant even call me back at the times she says she will call me i have to hunt her down basically i could have handled this matter myself and had it all done and over with long ago in less than the amount of time she requires to manage to get herself to the court when the right person is thereif you have the need for a defense attorney youve already got enough stress to deal with dont add to it by hiring anyone in this office or this attorney either they obviously care only about the money the make from their job not the people they representbennett  bennett houston criminaldefense lawyersf b ratedif there be any doubt in your mind about selecting mark bennett to defend you against a legal assault mounted by the federal state or local judicial systems against your life liberty or happinesscast them aside if you are reading this you are very likely under such assault just know there is only one goal to this assault and that is to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law regardless of guilt or innocence or extenuating circumstance it is their job and they like it and the only thing standing between you and a conviction is your defense attorney upon whom your fate will utterly depend so you had better make the right choice i can personally attest that they don’t come any better than mark bennett period he is the best of the best a lawyer’s lawyer with compassion integrity and a deeply intuitive situational intelligence that enables him to create highly effective strategies and tactics to win your case he can think within the box outside the box and even upend the box if necessarywhatever the situation requires not only does he keep up with the very latest developments in federal state and local legal standards practices and laws his cutting edge commentaries and articles on a wide variety of evolving legal issues help to shape and inform the attitudes and opinions of innumerable practicing lawyers and judges both locally and nationally on at least one occasion while in court he actually had to educate the judge and prosecutor of a change in the law which as a matter of course led to yet another dismissal this is a defense attorney that you want at your sideterry  thweatt pc attorneys at lawkirkbr ratedterry  thweatt is a god sent firm i suffered severe burns to my stomach when i was eating at a fast food restaurant i looked up injury attorneys located in the texas city area and came across terry  thweatt so i called them but was politely informed by irene one of the assistants that their office is located in houston irene continued to get information regarding my injuries and then transferred my call to one of the attorneys joseph terry i was able to get an appointment that same day terry explained the process that we would be involved in and let me know that it can be a long process attorney joseph terry was patient and answered all my questions  all my girlfriend’s questions and concerns i decided to give them a try and man am i glad that i did this firm is by far the most professional and friendly business that i have had to deal with not only are they friendly over the phone but in person too i know that i am not the easiest person to deal with but irene was persistent friendly and professional throughout the whole case unlike other places that are only friendly the first time that you come in to sign the contract i am very happy with the outcome of my case and the services that terry  thweatt provided me with i highly recommend terry  thweatt especially joseph terry to anyone that needs a lawyer for injuries that they suffer because he is so knowledgeable and efficient thank you joseph terry and irenecogdell dansecret n ratedmr akers and the cogdell law firm represented me when i was charged with felony theft i was accused of stealing a bag which contained items belonging to offduty police officers a felony conviction of this nature would have prevented me from practicing my chosen career due to the gravity of the charges against me i knew that i needed immediate proven and effective representation mr akers began gathering information about my case as soon as we ended our telephone conversation and was up to speed for our first meeting he laid out the best case scenario as well as worst case scenario and his recommended plan to resolve the charges against me cordt and his firm kept me appraised to every step that occurred with my case they were able to reschedule hearings for me when i was absolutely unable to travel to harris county for them cordt was available to me whenever i needed to get into contact with him when the prosecution would not budge cordt had informed me that he had already been preparing for trial in case that was the route i chose to take ultimately cordt was able to get the charges against me dismissed for which i am truly grateful requiring a criminal defense attorney means you are already in a stressful and worrying situation i recommend cordt akers to lift some weight off of your shoulders and to guide you through the legal system returning a favorable outcome h brad parker p cn r ratedi hired mr h brad parker seven years ago for bankruptcy and he and his office took the time to understand the specifics of my case the law office of h brad parker helped me save my home from foreclosure and fought the creditors that tried to bring additional financial ruin to me my case was not an easy one and not once did mr parker shun away from the obstacles he was always ready to fight my case and find a way bring justice in fact when my case was discharged some creditors surfaced and tried to falsely collect on a debt once again mr parker was immediately on the case and working toward a favorable result for memr parker went the extra mile for my case he is sincere in his approach and truly cared about the impact of a negative judgment in my case he seeks justice and is concerned about my future as it relates to my case my only regret is that i did not find mr parker years earlier when i needed a family lawyer for any person seeking an honest sincere expert lawyer look no further mr parker’s approach may be different than other lawyers but it is a breath of fresh air you are not a number when a client at h brad parker offices but part of your case legal teammy experience has been so wonderful with the offices of h brad parker that i would not consider

terry  thweatt pc my wife and i were involved in a personal injury case that required the assistance of legal professional s we retained the services of terry  thweatt via a professional reference we were very pleased with the professionalism and expertise demonstrated by this law firm we were represented by counsel joseph terry the legal assistance provided by mr terry was instrumental in obtaining results that far exceeded our expectations the demeanor and attitude of mr terry and his staff demonstrates that this law firm does what many other law firms repeatedly fail to do put the client’s interest first granted our case did require a little patience but what matters in the end are the results overall the experience that we had with this law firm was a positive and pleasant one it’s difficult to find attorney’s that are honest straightforward and most importantly client service driven the law firm of terry  thweat clearly reflects a client service driven culture therefore i

handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past
