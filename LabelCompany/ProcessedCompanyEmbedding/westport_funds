philosophyedit according to ray dalio bridgewater associates is a global macro firm it uses quantitative investment methods to identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations rather than asset allocations additionally the company is reported to only accept funds from institutional clients such as pension funds foundations endowments and central banks rather than private investors separation of alpha and betaedit the company divides its investments into two basic categories  beta investments whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk and  alpha investments whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed the principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by dalio in  and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year  the firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each systematic diversificationedit according to bloomberg bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with wagers on or against markets around the world and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not move in lock step with each other to guide its investment strategies the companys top executives have compiled hundreds of decision rules which are the financial corollary to the firms employee handbook principles and these investment guidelines have been incorporated into the firms computers analysis productsedit the firm offers three hedge funds to its clients the pure alpha fund the all weather fund and the pure alpha major markets fund it also publishes a white paper called the daily observations which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis pure alphaedit bridgewater associates launched its flagship fund pure alpha in  the fund is described as a diversified alpha source that invests across a group of asset classes it was designed to balance risk among a variety of noncorrelated assets through active management it includes  or  simultaneous trading positions in bonds currencies stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area after placing some of the companys excess cash into the pure alpha hedge fund to increase its investing discretion the fund was closed to new investors in  when it reached its predetermined maximum funds level as of  the fund is reported to have lost money in only three of its  years of existence and had an average annualized return of  the success of pure alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes all weatheredit a second fund called all weather was launched in  and highlighted low fees global inflationlinked bonds and global fixedincome investments the fund began as the founders personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients the goal of the fund was to create high risk adjusted returns that exceeded the return of the general market the all weather fund contains more than us billion and is one of the largest funds in the us as of  in april  after the collapse of lehman brothers the fund moved into safe portfolio mode which included nominal and inflationlinked bonds and gold instead of equities emerging market debt and commodities  pure alpha major marketsedit under the guidance of coceo jensen the firm created the pure alpha major markets in  with us billion from existing clients in the summer of  the fund was opened to a group of outside investors who had made a total advance commitment of us billion at that time it was reported to be the largest hedge fund launch the fund was established to provide an investment vehicle similar to the companys pure alpha fund but with enhanced liquidity by focusing on the major markets such as european bonds the launch of this fund in  brought the company’s total assets under management to more than us billion daily observationsedit the companys daily observations is a subscription white paper and was the flagship product and service offered by the company in  subscribers paid  per year it has been characterized as comprehensive with some editions being up to  pages in length and is reported to be one of the most widely forwarded pieces of market analysis in the industry it has been read by leaders of central banks managers of global pension funds as well as former us treasury secretary timothy geitner and president barack obama corporate affairsedit headquartersedit aerial view of the bridgewater associates corporate campus in westport connecticut in  the company moved its headquarters  miles north of new york city to wilton connecticut and in the late s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in westport connecticut as the company continued to expand it became the sole tenant at the acre campus the firms headquarters is described as retreatlike and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve the campus contains three buildings made of midcentury modern fieldstone and glass since  its staff has grown from  to  employees and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area in an effort to consolidate its offices the company made plans to build a  square foot headquarters in stamford ct about  miles from its present location in westport but cancelled the project in  employeesedit bridgewater associates grew from  employees in  to  employees in  the company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from ivy league schools employees are transported daily in a fancy bus that ferries them from manhattan to the companys westport offices according to an article in bloomberg about a quarter of all new hires leave within the first two years those that remain are reported to receive generous compensation and form bonds with fellow employees that are like family and the companys founder helps to pay for any employees that wish to learn the transcendental meditation technique dalio the founder relinquished his chief executive officer ceo title in july  to take on the role of mentor the companys administration consists of three coceos greg jensen eileen murray and david mccormick the former undersecretary of the treasury department the company also has three cocios chief investment officers dalio bob prince and jensen who is also coceo jensen the yearold coceo oversees the research programs at the firm and came to the company as a dartmouth college intern about  years earlier britt harris formerly of verizon investment management joined bridgewater as coceo in november  but left six months later according to dalio the cultural fit was a problem but harris is a superstar with an absolutely fabulous character from  until early  bridgewaters general counsel was james comey former united states deputy attorney general and former director of the federal bureau of investigation corporate cultureedit in  dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called principles which was distributed to all employees the publication is said to be part selfhelp book part management manual and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting according to one trade journal six years after the publication of principles the firms rapid expansion led to the institution of a bizarre culture of criticism the company acknowledges that employees often encounter culture shock when they begin working there and dalio admits its not for everyone according to the companys web site employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the companys culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress a  article in new york magazine described the company as the largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund because of its unwavering commitment to total honesty and accountability and minute detail in its corporate culture for example dalio encourages employees to do whatever it takes to make the company great and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes all meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary in addition dalio says that he fosters an extreme meritocracy of ideas and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy he says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return the companys flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms and qualities like stodginess and riskaversion are discouraged the company has been likened to a cult but dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated community an article in the new yorker by john cassidy says that the word cult clearly has connotations that dont apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a strongwilled leader and that employees use a unique vocabulary one client bob jacksha chief executive officer of the new mexico educational retirement board said of the firm every investment manager has its own culture and some are more unique than others schism atop giant hedge fundedit in  the wall street journal reported that dalio and greg jensen called for votes on each others conduct dalio asked the firms management and stakeholders committees if they believe jensen has integrity referencesedit coordinates °′″n °′″w﻿  ﻿°n °w﻿     a b kishan saijel september   hedge funds facing succession challenge as kovner hands

bridgewater associates grew from  employees in  to  employees in  the company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from ivy league schools employees are transported daily in a fancy bus that ferries them from manhattan to the companys westport offices according to an article in

harris is a superstar with an absolutely fabulous character from  until early  bridgewaters general counsel was james comey former united states deputy attorney general and former director of the federal bureau of investigation corporate cultureedit in  dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called principles which was distributed to all employees the publication is said to be part selfhelp book part management manual and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting according to one trade journal six years after the publication of principles the firms rapid expansion led to the institution of a bizarre culture of criticism the company acknowledges that employees often encounter culture shock when they begin working there and dalio admits its not for everyone according to the companys web site employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the companys culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress a  article in new york magazine described the company as the largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund because of its unwavering commitment to total honesty and accountability and minute detail in its corporate culture for example dalio encourages employees to do whatever it takes to make the company great and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes all meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary in addition dalio says that he fosters an extreme meritocracy of ideas and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy he says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return the companys flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms and qualities like stodginess and riskaversion are discouraged the company has been likened to a cult but dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated community an article in the new yorker by john cassidy says that the word cult clearly has connotations that dont apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a strongwilled leader and that employees use a unique vocabulary one client bob jacksha chief executive officer of the new mexico educational retirement board said of the firm every investment manager has its own culture and some are more unique than others schism atop giant hedge fundedit in  the wall street

bridgewater associates is a global macro firm it uses quantitative investment methods to identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations rather than asset allocations additionally the company is reported to only accept funds from institutional clients such as pension funds foundations endowments and central banks rather than private investors separation of alpha and betaedit the company divides its investments into two basic categories  beta investments whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk and  alpha investments whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed the principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by dalio in  and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year  the firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each systematic diversificationedit according to bloomberg bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with wagers on or against markets around the world and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not move in lock step with each other to guide its investment strategies the companys top executives have compiled hundreds of decision rules which are the financial corollary to the firms employee handbook principles and these investment guidelines have been incorporated into the firms computers analysis productsedit the firm offers three hedge funds to its clients the pure alpha fund the all weather fund and the pure alpha major markets fund it also publishes a white paper called the daily observations which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis pure alphaedit bridgewater associates launched its flagship fund pure alpha in  the fund is described as a diversified alpha source that invests across a group of asset classes it was designed to balance risk among a variety of noncorrelated assets through active management it includes  or  simultaneous trading positions in bonds currencies stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area after placing some of the companys excess cash into the pure alpha hedge fund to increase its investing discretion the fund was closed to new investors in  when it reached its predetermined maximum funds level as of  the fund is reported to have lost money in only three of its  years of existence and had an average annualized return of  the success of pure alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes all weatheredit a second fund called all weather was launched in  and highlighted low fees global inflationlinked bonds and global fixedincome investments the fund began as the founders personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients the goal of the fund was to create high risk adjusted returns that exceeded the return of the general market the all weather fund contains more than us billion and is one of the largest funds in the us as of  in april  after the collapse of lehman brothers the fund moved into safe portfolio mode which included nominal and inflationlinked bonds and gold instead of equities emerging market debt and commodities  pure alpha major marketsedit under the guidance of coceo jensen the firm created the pure alpha major markets in  with us billion from existing clients in the summer of  the fund was opened to a group of outside investors who had made a total advance commitment of us billion at that time it was

subscription white paper and was the flagship product and service offered by the company in  subscribers paid  per year it has been characterized as comprehensive with some editions being up to  pages in length and is reported to be one of the most widely forwarded pieces of market analysis in the industry it has been read by leaders of central banks managers of global pension funds as well as former us treasury secretary timothy geitner and president barack obama corporate affairsedit headquartersedit aerial view of the bridgewater associates corporate campus in westport connecticut in  the company moved its headquarters  miles north of new york city to wilton connecticut and in the late s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in westport connecticut as the company continued to expand it became the sole tenant at the acre campus the firms headquarters is described as retreatlike and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve the campus contains three buildings made of midcentury modern fieldstone and glass since  its staff has grown from  to  employees and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area in an effort to consolidate its offices the company made plans to build a  square foot headquarters in stamford ct about  miles from its present location in westport but cancelled the project in  employeesedit bridgewater associates grew from  employees in  to  employees in  the company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from ivy league schools employees are transported daily in a fancy bus that ferries them from manhattan to the companys westport offices according to an article in bloomberg about a quarter of all new hires leave within the first two years those that remain are reported to receive generous compensation and form bonds with fellow employees that are like family and the companys founder helps to pay for any employees that wish to learn the transcendental meditation technique dalio the founder relinquished his chief executive officer ceo title in july  to take on the role of mentor the companys administration consists of three coceos greg jensen eileen murray and david mccormick the former undersecretary of the treasury department the company also has three cocios chief investment officers dalio bob prince and jensen who is also coceo jensen the yearold coceo oversees the research programs at the firm and came to the company as a dartmouth college intern about  years earlier britt harris formerly of verizon investment management joined bridgewater as coceo in november  but left six months later according to dalio the cultural fit was a problem but harris is a superstar with an absolutely fabulous character from  until early  bridgewaters general counsel was james comey former united states deputy attorney general and former director of the federal bureau of investigation corporate cultureedit in  dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called principles which was distributed to all employees the publication is said to be part selfhelp book part management manual and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting according to one trade journal six years after the publication of principles the firms rapid expansion led to the institution of a bizarre culture of criticism the company acknowledges that employees often encounter culture shock when they begin working there and dalio admits its not for everyone according to the companys web site employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the companys culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress a  article in new york magazine described the company as the largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund because of its unwavering commitment to total honesty and accountability and minute detail in its corporate culture for example dalio encourages employees to do whatever it takes to make the company great and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes all meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary in addition dalio says that he fosters an extreme meritocracy of ideas and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy he says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return the companys flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms and qualities like stodginess and riskaversion are discouraged the company has been likened to a cult but dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated community an article in the new yorker by john cassidy says that the word cult clearly has connotations that dont apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a strongwilled leader and that employees use a unique vocabulary one client bob jacksha chief executive officer of the new mexico educational retirement board said of the firm every investment manager has its own culture and some are more unique than others schism atop giant hedge fundedit in  the wall street journal reported that dalio and greg jensen called for votes on each others conduct dalio asked the firms management and stakeholders committees if they believe jensen has integrity referencesedit
