would now like to turn the call over to denny oates denny were ready to begin denny oates thanks june good morning everyone thanks for joining us here today the broad based recovery that began for universal in the first quarter of  continued to show traction in the second quarter with business and plant activity levels clearly improved as a result we saw a strong sequential and yearoveryear growth in our top line which included record premium alloy sales combined with a significant improvement in our gross margin from the first quarter leading to a decisive return to bottom line profitability and noteworthy growth in our ebitda let me drill down in our second quarter performance with some additional details second quarter sales totaled  million an increase of  sequentially and up  compared with the second quarter of  this brings yeartodate sales to  million up  from the same period last year sales of premium alloys reached  million or  of sales topping a previous quarterly record of  million or  of total sales which was set in the first quarter of  order backlog before surcharges of  million grew  compared to march  and stand at  greater than june of  which bodes well for the normally seasonally slow second half order entry so far in july is been stronger than normal seasonal expectations gross margin made a sizable move up in the second quarter to  of sales the highest level obtained since  as we benefited from the sellthrough of products manufactured in higher activity months that started in january coupled with manufacturing productivity savings in a more favorable product mix we see opportunities for additional margin improvement in coming quarters although obviously dont expect as dramatic move as a sequential improvement in the second quarter with a recovery in our margin net income in the second quarter showing to a positive  million or  per diluted share from an equal size loss in the first quarter enabling us to reach breakeven for the first half and other indicator of our much improved profitability second quarter ebitda was up  sequentially and up  from the second quarter of  as a result were on track with our plan to deliver further progress in the second half of the year there are some additional factors supporting a positive outlook through the second half price increases announced in q for stainless and low alloy products began to take effect this month commodity prices have been somewhat volatile but nothing like the experience of  and  while nickel did fall from  per pound to  per pound during the first half other key commodities increased nickel has since rallied ph in july to about  per pound therefore our surcharges will be modestly lower in july and august probably recovering to june levels by september we do not anticipate any meaningful distortion in buying patterns or misalignment in material cost and surcharges another positive is that we won a total of five more customer approvals in the second quarter four for major aerospace oems and one for major energy services company there are also two additional premium products commercialized during the quarter our pipeline remained strong with  products currently under development plant activity levels continue to run high we expect to run at a rate similar to the second quarter which represents a  increase over s third quarter production levels as we noted last time higher plant volumes not only generate favorable operating leverage on product cost they also enable added variable cost savings from improvement initiatives both completed and currently underway another potential positive rest ph with a final outcome with the commerce department section  investigation and whether commerce will find that us national security is threatened by steel imports how this will all play out is uncertain but we are confident that some actions will be taken this year to address the subject of unfair trade in steel and the chronic issue of excess global steel capacity let me take a minute and note two developments on the corporate front during the second quarter first we were successful in achieving an early labor agreement at our dunkirk facility the new fiveyear agreement maintains the flexible work rule terms and profit sharing incentives contained in the prior agreement separately as most of you know we received unsolicited offer from synalloy corporation for proposed business combination in response we announced on june  that after deliberation and careful consultation with independent financial and legal advisors our board unanimously rejected the offers having no merit for the stockholders of universal either financial or strategic and that there was no basis for further discussions we sincerely appreciate the strong support we received from the many investors we spoke with about our decisions let me take a few minutes and turn to our end market starting with aerospace our largest market aerospace sales totaled  million in the second quarter of  representing  of quarterly sales aerospace sales increased  sequentially and  from the second quarter of  our continued growth in aerospace reflects positive industry trends along with the addition of the premium alloy products that we developed and won approval for over the past several years aerospace market fundamentals as well as supplier channel demand are being driven by continued strong build rates and backlogs at boeing and airbus currently estimated at seven to nine years of production depending on whose numbers you want to use the market got additional boost from indiscernible where orders were more robust than expected and i personally want to say the environment was much more positive in recent years boeing posted orders for  aircraft including orders for well received launch of the  max  which drew  new orders along with  conversions airbus also booked another  airplanes the engine manufacturers were also active at the paris air show for example ge and its joint venture companies led by cfm announced  billion in orders and commitments at the show rolls royce booked  million in fact continued to add to their backlog the ongoing strength and demand for air travel is evidenced in the most recent release from iata the international airport transport association for may that reported global traffic was up  yearoveryear the growth of revenue passenger miles continues to be above expectations this year which is driving aftermarket demand this is another source of good news for the metal supply chain and for universal its also worth noting the iata reported that air freight traffic increased  may versus last year another sign of the increase in economic activity and further aftermarket demand were also seeing building momentum in the defense sector so we remain as positive as ever about the aerospace opportunity for universal business is picked up customer inventories are generally imbalanced and the market remains healthy overall the heavy equipment market remained our second largest market in the second quarter representing  of total sales compared with  in the first quarter and  in the second quarter of  heavy equipment sales totaled  million in the second quarter and increased to  from the first quarter of  and double our level in the second quarter of  our tool steel plate sales are the main component of this heavy equipment category and theyre continuing to be driven by strong domestic demand resulting from solid vehicle production numbers albeit  to  lower than  and a very healthy clip of automotive model changeovers also driving demand growth is heightened activity for heavy offroad equipment makers such as caterpillar which reported a second consecutive quarter of improving demand and an upbeat outlook for the second half in fact the recent survey of construction equipment makers by wall street analyst indicated that market supply conditions are tightening and late times are extending because of that activity and low inventories universal is benefitting from this ramp coupled with a shorter ph lead times we can offer as a domestic supplier the oil and gas end market represent  in the second quarter  sales compared with  in the first quarter and  the year ago second quarter our oil and gas sales totaled  million in the  second quarter essentially level with the first quarter and  ahead of the second quarter  while demand was flat in the most recent quarter there has been substantial improvement for us and for the market since last year with landbased drilling activity up rig counts continue to increase and channel inventories continuing to be work down we expect slow steady recovery in the market along with greater acceptance of new products weve introduced in recent years the power generation market representing  of second quarter sales in line with the first quarter of  and compared with  in the  second quarter the power generation sales totaled  million in the second quarter up  sequentially and up  from the second quarter of  our power gen sales was picked up in the second quarter continued to be largely driven by the maintenance business and as noted last quarter that business is benefiting from the continued move financial gas as the fuel of choice i ph recall on the new builds front on prior ge reported receiving nine orders for its ha gas turbine bringing its backlog to  units this gas turbine is worlds largest high efficiency turbines ge is also the worlds largest supplier of gas turbines overall and how many of their new turbines they decided to build in the us will be an important factor and the return of the new build market to the metals community in the meantime we will focus on the maintenance market opportunity as installed turbines are continuing to work at higher activity levels rounding up my end market review our general industrial market sales were  of sales versus  in the  first quarter and  of sales in the second quarter of  second quarter general industrial sales totaled  million which was slightly lower than the first quarter but up  from the second quarter last year as mentioned last time weve developed several new products to increase our participation in infrastructure related projects and business development activities for domestic manufacturing we continue to expect growth in this market to continue in  subject to normal project seasonality any federal infrastructure will be an added plus lets take a few minutes to look at the financials ross ross wilkins thank you denny as denny already noted second quarter  sales of  million were up  sequentially and up  compared with the second quarter of  for the first six months of  sales of  million were up  compared with the first half of  the increase was broad based with all end markets contributing to the increase versus prior year both for the second quarter and for the first half as a whole gross margin in the second quarter was  million or  of sales up almost  basis points from the first quarter of  and up  basis points from the second quarter of  it is the highest level achieved in the past  quarters the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by the realization of manufacturing productivity initiatives improved operating leverage and a more favorable product mix looking at selling general and administrative cost for the second quarter sga was  million or  of sales and a reduction of  compared with the first quarter of  and a  lower compared to the second quarter of  our yeartodate tax rate is high at  reflecting the impact of  income tax expense associated with adopting the new accounting rules related to stockbased compensation under the previous rules this amount would have gone to the balance sheet we expect our full year income tax rate to be approximately  bottom line net income in the second quarter was  million or  per diluted share a  per diluted share improvement compared with the  million loss or  per diluted share in the first quarter of  yeartodate  were breakeven at net income significantly improved from the loss of  million or  per diluted share in the first half of  looking at ebitda second quarter ebitda was  million an increase of  million or  sequentially and an increase of  million or  compared with the second quarter of  adjusting for noncash share comp expense ebitda was  million for the second quarter ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations are provided in the tables to the press release turning our attention to the balance sheet during the second quarter managed working capital of  million increased by  million compared with the first quarter of  and is consistent with business activity accounts receivable increased by  million and inventory increased by  million accounts payable were flat the increase in inventory is in direct support of higher backlog which grew by  million during the quarter and the increase in accounts receivable is directly attributable to the higher sales activity in the second quarter despite the increase in working capital overall managed working capital efficiency as measured by taking working capital as a percent of annualized second quarter sales was  and thus maintain the improvement realized in the first quarter it continues to be the best that has been in the last five years capital expenditures for the second quarter were  million marginally higher than the  million in the first quarter of  and up from the prior year second quarter level which was  for full year  we expect capex to be in the  million to  million range down from the previous range of  million to  million reflecting more selective capital spending across the business as a whole as youll note capital expenditures continue to be less than our ongoing depreciation and amortization expense which is  million annualized reflecting the fact that we largely have the assets in place from investments previously made to support the growth in the business total debt was  million as of march   an increase of  million compared with the end of the first quarter driven primarily by working capital increases noted earlier despite the higher debt borrowing availability under our credit facility at the end of the second quarter expanded to  million a record high since entering the credit facility  months ago included in the increased availability is  million that our bank group released to us during the second quarter based upon our improved financial results since entering into the credit agreement from an interest rate standpoint with the companies higher profitability in the second quarter our senior debt leverage ratio improved to  times thus qualifying us for  basis point reduction in its interest rate effective immediately this is the second such interest rate reduction in the last six months and applies to all senior debt lastly we remain in compliance with all our covenants under the bank credit facility at the end of the second quarter and we anticipate remaining in compliance going forward for the foreseeable future this concludes my financial report denny ill turn the call back to you denny oates thanks ross let me summarize recovery that began for universal in the first quarter of  continued in the second quarter it was reflected in strong sequential and yearoveryear sales growth including record premium alloy sales along with a sizable move up in our gross margin all leading to a decisive return to bottom line profitability and substantial growth in our ebitda weve entered the third quarter with  higher backlog price increases taking effect added customer approvals more commercialized products and high plane activity levels that are adding to operating leverage and variable cost savings our end markets are generally moving forward including our largest aerospace to reiterate my statement in todays earnings release as we enter the third quarter in second half of the year business conditions and demand remain positive with continued strength in our order entry and backlog that concludes our formal remarks andrew lets take some question from our callers questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from michael gallo with cl king your line is now open michael gallo couple questions i guess from just to sort of characterize your remark i mean it seems like business momentum is continued youre going to get the benefit of the price increases youre starting to come through in the third quarter youll have a little bit less surcharge well im just trying to parse all of that together would you expect on a sequential basis that q will look like q or do you still expect the gross margins to improve sequentially as you get the benefit of pricing denny oates i would expect the modest improvement in margin midteens kind of number and as far as the sales i think it will a bit of anomaly on the the normal seasonal trend is the third quarter second half usually slower than the first half and usually the first half by quarter the fourth quarter is the weakest from a sale standpoint third quarter is second weakest and from a booking standpoint you start to see orders trail off mid third quarter anticipating a slower fourth quarter if you look at our backlog in the trend and bookings i suspect that the third quarter sales numbers are going to be at or slightly above where we are in the second quarter so modest improvement indiscernible midteen kind of margin would be my best estimate right now michael gallo so you still think youll be able to increase the sale sequentially even though youll have less surcharge denny oates yes michael gallo all right okay and in terms of what you have planned further capex opportunities i know youve been thinking about automation project at dunkirk update us on some of the other initiatives and how you think you can get more efficient from a manufacturing standpoint thanks denny oates well the one capital you mentioned up at dunkirk is something that was essentially approved by our board contingent fund getting a labor contract in place now that labor contract in place so thats a transaction about  to  million investment that would begin in the fourth quarter so you wont see much of that capital in rosss numbers that he quoted earlier thatll be mostly  investment with a benefit starting to flow in the latter part of  and  so that would be a significant improvement to our quality our cost and our throughput on finished power products there were other opportunities for capital that were looking at were coming out of the period where we were very tight with capital our focus was on generating cash and paying down debt so i think on the next call well have more to say on this subject but there are opportunities to make significant improvements in our melt shops the whole subject of the digital world and getting better control of our facilities is something that will become a bigger part of our investments over the next couple of years being able to get access to equipment is operating and have equipment talking to equipment will give us tighter control over things less variability on our manufacturing shop which will lead to higher quality better yields and lower cost so thats kind of directionally where were headed but were not prepared to announce any larger investments beyond the dunkirk thing michael gallo thank you very much operator operator instructions our next question comes from phil gibbs with keybanc capital markets your line is now open phil gibbs had a question on the net working capital i think you said managed working capital was  of sales in the quarter do you have any tactical targets in terms of where you think that could be over the next  months and do you also have strategic targets in terms of where you think you want to get that over the next three to five years denny oates if you look at the work in process inventory itself excluding raw materials you look at the next couple quarters you should see those numbers come down if you look at the next quarter somewhere in the range of  million  million fourth quarter flat and im saying flat because it really is the function of how business is as we look at the first quarter normally you start to ramp up a little bit of inventory through the tail end of the year but fundamentally from a financial standpoint our inventories are around so strategically our longterm growth our longterm plan is to get that number up towards three which is a challenging target but thats our longterm strategic goal there right now were running  million phil gibbs so the work in process inventory is really the biggest driver to getting that percentage down over the longterm is that indiscernible denny oates yes i think we do a decent job managing our payables and our receivables there is no real big issues there in terms of pulling those in a significant amount the real issue is going to be getting things manufactured getting higher percentage done the first time and getting things moving through the shop and i would just remind you that were still on development mode on lot of these alloys so were still carrying somewhere in the range of  million plus of material that i would characterize as experimental test type rd material that is kind of there its good material to sell at some point in time but we need some approvals and further work before we can move that into the marketplace and if you recall from a couple years ago were up around  million on that number phil gibbs okay the heavy equipment piece i think you said  of sales is that largely the tools deal plate business denny oates majority of its tool steel plate yes phil gibbs and you mentioned at the off road pieces getting better and clearly were seeing that with some of the results from indiscernible how big in relation to that heavy equipment side is the auto piece versus the off road piece denny oates its one of those numbers its hard for me to give you a real specific answer because every pound that we sell goes to distribution so we cant get the visibility so im quoting the when i look at what drives that business its primarily automotive followed by the off road followed by cutlery and things like that but a basic metal fabrication anywhere you need to cut metal so to speak youre going to see that use so as a manufacturing sector and the economy picks up you should see growth there but i cant give you a specific percent on automotive generically i dont think anybody can quite frankly but generically studies ive seen over the years generally stated that twothirds of tool steel produced in the us goes in the automotive market whereas driven by the automotive market phil gibbs well thats helpful makes sense too because auto is a bigger market broadly speaking on the side of electrodes there is a lot of talk that electrodes are poised to go up right now a lot i mean theyre really tight globally given what were seeing out of china and the increase in eaf production this year in general how big is that normally in terms of your call it cost to sales or cost to production denny oates if you take a look at situational electrodes for those of you who dont know is there is some issues where right now we have trouble getting price quotes out in  due to new batteries that are being produced demand for some of the raw materials that go into electrodes is up therefore pricing has gotten tight we are covered in terms of what we require in the price through the first quarter of  but beyond that there is a lot of churn in the marketplace so i honestly cant tell you what that price would be the price has been  to  per pound you hear numbers floating around  to  per pound so i cannot  thats the best i can tell you phil i cant give you any hard numbers on that obviously thats a big number if that were to go up that would probably hit us in the tune of about  a year somewhere in that range so its a significant number its something were watching very carefully were working with our suppliers to make sure that weve got a hard supply and the latest i have as in this morning that well get some price quotes in the month of august but right now theyre not even quoting beyond first quarter phil gibbs thats really helpful and last question for me for now is on the sga obviously a lot of good work there in terms of maintaining on an absolute basis at opex level sequentially in yearonyear but your business is getting better profits are getting better are you expecting are you expecting some upward migration or little bit creep to that sga number just as the incentives improve are you able to hold this line denny oates if the year continues as projected youll see some increase in sga indiscernible it will be variable compensation and there maybe some additional legal fees related to the whole trade issues as we go through the second half of the year phil gibbs so between  and  is good denny oates yes phil gibbs in terms of good base denny oates yes phil gibbs thanks a lot operator operator instructions and im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to mr oates for any further remarks denny oates thanks andrew once again let me thank you for joining us this morning we sincerely appreciate your support and your interest in universal stainless well look forward to

includes discussions of financial measures that have not been determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  these measures include earnings loss before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda  we include these measurements to enhance the understanding of our operating performance  we believe that ebitda considered along with net earnings loss is a relevant indicator of trends relating to cash generating activity of our operations  adjusted ebitda excludes the effect of sharebased compensation expense and other noncash generating activity such as impairments and the writeoff of deferred financing costs we believe excluding these costs provides a consistent comparison of the cash generating activity of our operations  we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful to investors as they facilitate a comparison of our operating performance to other companies who also use ebitda and adjusted ebitda as supplemental operating measures  these nongaap financial measures supplement our gaap disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the gaap measures  these nongaap measures may not be entirely comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to potential differences among calculations methodologies  a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with gaap is included in the tables that follow tables follow  universal stainless  alloy products incfinancial highlightsdollars in
