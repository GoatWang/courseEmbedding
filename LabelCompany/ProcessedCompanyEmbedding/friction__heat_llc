sometimes see triboluminescence – ruslan apr  at  add a comment    answers  active oldest votes up vote  down vote accepted they produce heat because the surfaces on small scales are rough like canyons rather than flat like the ocean as these rough surfaces come into contact with each other they repel when two atoms are brought very close together they store potential energy when they move apart that energy becomes kinetic however this kinetic energy generally isnt enough to escape the object they are attached to so the energy becomes randomly distributed as kinetic energy exchanged between the atoms of the object also known as thermal energy in some cases the energy is enough to break bonds and indeed friction can cause objects to deteriorate and fall apart as in a meteor falling through the sky being torn apart by atmospheric friction as for visible light if youve ever seen a meteor shower then you know that they do produce a lot of visible light due to friction with the atmosphere shareciteimprove this answer answered aug   at  alex     i feel it may be nice to elaborate a bit on the last paragraph adding some info about energy scales associated to certain frequency ranges of the em spectrum and why this explains the comet thing differing from your typical friction – danu aug   at  add a comment   up vote  down vote molecules are undergoing elastic collisions for any given substance the faster its molecules are colliding the hotter it is when an object slides along another object the total kinetic energy plus gravitational potential of its molecules plus gravitational potential energy must be conserved it can be proven that in newtonian physics for any system whose momentum doesnt change its kinetic energy increases by the same amount in all frames of reference though not necessarily the kinetic energy of each individual object in the system that means the total kinetic energy of each sliding object can be espressed as the sum of its kinetic energy of movement and the kinetic energy of its molecules when they slide across each other kinetic energy of movement is converted to kinetic energy of molecules since an object requires such a high speed of molecules like  ms to have room temperature not very much heat gets created for the amount of kinetic energy lost to friction thats why its easy to not notice that friction can produce any heat shareciteimprove this answer answered jul   at  user  add a comment   protected by qmechanic♦ may   at  thank you for your interest in this question because it has attracted

forces in human history jeremy hoarelife filegetty images youre probably familiar with friction the force that resists motion between two surfaces in everyday life we tend to think of friction as a bad thing after all its what makes it so hard to drag a couch across a room even outside the realm of physics the word has a negative connotation in terms of interpersonal relationships it means disagreement however if youre ever lost in the wilderness and in need of fire for survival youll thank your lucky stars for friction you may have heard that rubbing two sticks together can start a fire but were going to investigate the physics of how that really happens laws of attraction to understand friction we have to zoom into the microscopic level of whats going on between surfaces no surface  not even slippery ice  is perfectly smooth all surfaces have irregularities on the molecular level and when two touching surfaces move relative to each other they get caught in each others little hills and valleys not only that but the molecules from one surface actually start attracting molecules from the other surface and they form chemical bonds with each other breaking these bonds and pushing past the hills and valleys takes considerable work warming up when you push a couch across the floor much of your energy is wasted pushing the surface of the couch along the surface of the floor but that energy doesnt just disappear the law of conservation of energy states that it cant be created or destroyed friction converts useful kinetic energy also called ordered energy into thermal energy disordered energy or heat friction gets a bad rap for turning useful energy into useless energy its true that a lot of kinetic energy in the world is lost into the atmosphere as heat but heat isnt always useless for instance whenever our hands get cold we can rub them together and feel the heat from the friction almost immediately but more importantly heat is one of the three pillars required for starting a fire cmon baby light my fire the ingredients needed to start a fire are traditionally illustrated in the fire triangle the three legs of the triangle are fuel oxygen and heat when enough of these three factors is present a chemical reaction occurs that results in fire this is why you can start a fire with two sticks the fuel is the sticks the oxygen comes from the air and fiction provides the necessary heat but this is far from the only circumstance in which friction starts a fire even lighting a match relies on the heat that comes from the friction of striking and friction can feed on more than just wood  fuel can take the form of any flammable substance you might be surprised by what kinds of materials are flammable for instance metals plastics and rubber can all be set afire under the right conditions and temperatures such materials are especially prone to catching on fire  and fast  when they are in the form of powdery dust so to paraphrase the

exact reason is not very well understood but here is my explanationthere is no exact mechanism of heat generation i think it all depends on the physical and chemical properties of the two sliding objects that is the heat generation mechanism may be different for friction between two ductile materials and two brittle materials surface roughness maximum shear stress values surface hardness etc play an important role also the variation of the above said factors with temperature would also matterlet us consider two objects sliding wrt each other the immediate things that we may observe are sound vibrations erosion of material from the sliding surfaces and of course heatfrom these observations we can conclude that repeated local plastic and elstic deformation of the materials may be one reason then when material gets eroded or sheared of if they are not removed from the sliding surfaces it would aid in the deformation process again it is not just the deformation alone but the shearing off of material itself contribute to heat formation due to breaking of bonds the above explanation is best suited for friction between two ductile and rough materialsthe process maybe be different for some other material interface again friction between non metallic and metallic surface may cause heat through some other mechanism i have no answer for heat produced due to fluidsolid

even in extreme pressure and high temperature applications universal application for industrial commercial and house hold indooroutdoor protects against corrosion and reduces friction cfc and trichloroethane free aerosol dries fast and clean with no oily residue stays put without squeezing out like liquid lubricants may be used as a cleaning agent oxidized contacts corrosion and more download safety data sheet nano cool ndtnc nano cool is the first product of its kind to utilize today’s enhanced nanosized materials suspended in deionized water to displace heat faster and more efficiently than any other coolant reduces or eliminates bubbles or vapor barrier cavitation that form on hot metal surfaces to reduce coolant temperatures by up to °f °c increases horsepower extends engine life superior heat transfer properties compared to glycolbased antifreeze compatible with new or used antifreeze to improve the heat transfer of ethylene and propylene glycol systems improves heat transfer and reduces cylinder head temperature reduces engine oil temperature nano cool contains lubricity enhancers for improved water pump reliability increase thermal uptake and viscosity for better flow and heat transfer download safety data sheet put us to the test we’re dead set on taking high performance to extraordinary levels blending nanopromt’s specially engineered nanoparticles with oils greases and fluids to create next generation formulas and applying our advanced products to take on industry’s toughest problems we’re even taking on retail lubricants we dare you to bring us your toughest most critical applications we’ll prove to you that to go big you have to go small nano smallyou have to go with nanopromt creating heat from friction handson activity  discovery
