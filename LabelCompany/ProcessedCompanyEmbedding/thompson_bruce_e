fastforwarding live tv is a common habit now imagine standing in a subzero cryotherapy chamber for that same length of time living without a dvr doesnt sound so bad does itnbut what is cryotherapy exactly and why would anyone put their body through that to find out the answer we interviewed jim karas the owner of chicago cryospa and groupon beauty blogger favin who tried out cryotherapy at his facility heres what they had to say about the subzero wellness treatmentnwhat is cryotherapyncryotherapy is like an ice pack on steroids jim says thats why its so popular with athletes and those who

steps inside a cylindrical chamber about as tall as their shoulders leaving their head and neck exposed after disrobing their body is bathed in liquid nitrogen or refrigerated cold air with temperatures dipping to  degrees fahrenheitnstep  the client remains in the cold for – minutes depending on how experienced they are with the therapy favin stayed in for two minutes those short durations keep the bodys core temperature at a normal level even while skinsurface temperature drops by dozens of degreesnnour cryotherapy video can show you what to expectnnwhat does it feel likenreally cold as the temperature plunged throughout the twominute session favins technician tried to distract her telling favin to watch the flatscreen tv or spy on passersby on the street outside favin says it was hard for her to focus on anything but the cold but as soon as she stepped out of the chamber she felt instant reliefnmy skin was covered in giant goosebumps but they faded as soon as i jumped on a stationary bike the pedaling helped blood to flow back into my limbs and warmed me up within a minute or so she explainsnas soon as she got warm she felt a rush of energy from the adrenaline coursing through her body jim says that rush of energy is common more importantly favin noticed that her back didnt hurt quite as muchnat the end of that week i drove to cincinnati to visit family sitting in a car for that long would typically set my back on fire but i felt great the entire weekend even when i was chasing my cousins baby aroundnat the end of that week i drove to cincinnati to visit family sitting in a car for that long would typically set my back on fire but i felt great the entire weekend n– groupon beauty blogger favin after trying cryotherapynso how does cryotherapy worknnalthough cold therapy has been used for ages by athletes recovering from injuries and overworked muscles there hasnt been a ton of research on it but heres what proponents say cryotherapy doesnnit reduces skin temperature the cryo chamber causes a significant drop in surface body temperature which may cause the brain to think that youre in distress the brain responds to cold by sending blood to the core and away from the extremities once you step out of the chamber oxygenated blood is redistributed to the extremitiesnit constricts blood vessels vasoconstriction limits blood flow to the coldaffected areas in this case most of your body which helps reduce inflammationnit has a psychological effect jim says that many clients report feeling energized and euphoric after a session the release of endorphins and adrenaline may help elevate your mood researchers suggest but theres not a lot of evidence to say so conclusivelynnwhat does it treatnagain not a lot of research has been done on wholebody cryotherapy and the fda has not approved it as a medical treatment but proponents say it helps with musculoskeletal pain by reducing inflammation and possibly triggering cell repair and localized cryotherapy applied to the head via handoperated tool may relieve headaches a lot of their information comes from anecdotal evidence of pain reliefnwhat if you want to try cryotherapy for weight lossnsome proponents say that when the body sends blood rushing to your core during those two minutes in the chamber that increases your body heat and subsequently your metabolism however again theres really no evidence to support that right now still the treatment does have plenty of celebrity fansnwho cant get cryotherapynnaccording to jim people with larger builds may not be able to use certain equipment because skin cannot touch the interior walls think of the famous tonguetopole scene in a christmas story and he says it is not recommended for those with severe high blood pressure and heart problemsncryotherapy reviewsnheres what some of our groupon customers have to say about their subzero experiencesnepic cryospa was amazing in and
