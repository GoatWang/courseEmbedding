advice column › buying a business versus “starting from scratch” buying a business versus “starting from scratch” by steve toburen in steve’s “bleeding hearts” advice column question should i buy an existing carpet cleaning business steve’s answer buying a carpet cleaning business can be a great way to “kick start” your efforts hi steve i’m thinking about getting into carpet cleaning would buying an existing cleaningrestoration business be a better way to go instead of starting from scratch starting out in maryland dear starting buying an existing carpet cleaning business can be a good way to cut your growth curve if only because the typical business in this industry sadly sells for an absurdly low price your gaintheir loss it’s not unusual to see the entire carpet cleaning business selling for not much more than the liquidation value of the equipment and vehicles so assuming you want their equipment the customer list phone number etc all comes as a bonus of course you should exercise “due diligence” and verify the reputation of the business quality of its clients and the prices that they have been charging before you buy in other words do you even want the type of clientele that the business has attracted  you’ll find that many carpet cleaners are great people but don’t remotely have a clue on how to profitably price their work  but buying an existing business is definitely an option worth checking out note here is a carpet cleaning business valuation sheet it is designed for our members who are selling their business but you could use it to judge if a company is priced farily be sure to get competent professional financial and legal help before making any final decisions steve ps  also many business sellers will finance much of the purchase price and at very favorable rates  so don’t be afraid to negotiate  frankly speaking you should be in the driver’s seat simply because many of the carpet cleaning businesses for sale out there are not moving real fast  like everything else in business it is a supply and demand equation one other suggestion starting  honesty if not selfinterest compels me to mention that as a new prospective carpet cleaner you should attend our strategies for success seminar right from the gitgo before you buy anything  sfs provides a great industry  orientation for example… jon fields with restorepro in sandusky oh attended sfs years ago while his very first machine was being installed at our roselle facility  the man had never touched a scrub wand  read what happened to jon as an industry “new boy”

area and require your attention business structure while starting a business involves a number of practical considerations structure remains the primary determination to be made at the outset many entrepreneurs do not consider forming a business entity instead the business will default to a sole proprietorship in the case of an individual owner or a general partnership if there are multiple owners those two types of businesses have significant disadvantages mainly in the form of unlimited liability creditors of the business can recover the owner’s personal assets for business liabilities the main advantage of those entities passthrough tax treatment – means that profits are not taxed at the business level is available with entities that offer liability protection s corporations are the most common entities that provide the owner personal protection with passthrough tax treatment to create any corporation the owner must file articles of incorporation with the department of state make an election to be treated as an s corp adopt bylaws and hold initial meetings of shareholders and directors – among other organizational tasks in comparison with other entities startup cost and administrative formalities are usually greater for s corporations s corps are limited to  shareholders limited partnerships lps and limited liability companies llcs offer a usually less burdensome alternative to s corps both of these entities are formed by filing documents with the department of state and are largely governed by internal agreements between the owners while at least one owner of a limited partnership must serve as general partner and be subject to unlimited liability all members of an llc are afforded limited liability llcs however may be subject to a state’s capital stock tax such is the case in pennsylvania “choosing the right structure with the assistance of an attorney and an accountant enables entrepreneurs to protect their personal assets from business creditors while avoiding corporate taxes this will prove instrumental to successful startup and smooth growth over time”source pittsburgh post gazette donald b formoso peacock keller growth plans try to
