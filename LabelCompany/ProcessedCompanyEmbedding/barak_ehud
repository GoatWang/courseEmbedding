the labor party prime minister of israel barak at the pentagon  in the  prime ministerial election barak beat benjamin netanyahu by a wide margin however he sparked controversy by deciding to form a coalition with the ultraorthodox party shas who had won an unprecedented  seats in the seat knesset shas grudgingly agreed to baraks terms that they eject their leader aryeh deri a convicted felon and enact reform to clean up inparty corruption consequentially the left wing meretz party quit the coalition after they failed to agree on the powers to be given to a shas deputy minister in the ministry of education in  barak gave a campaign promise to end israels yearlong occupation of southern lebanon within a year on  may  israel withdrew from southern lebanon on  october three israeli soldiers were killed in a border raid by hezbollah and their bodies were subsequently captured the bodies of these soldiers along with the living elhanan tenenbaum were eventually exchanged for lebanese captives in  the barak government resumed peace negotiations with the plo stating that every attempt by the state of israel to keep hold of this area the west bank and gaza as one political entity

which is thought to have made over nis  million after peres lost the race to amir peretz and left the labor party barak announced he would stay at the party despite his shaky relationship with its newly elected leader he declared however that he would not run for a spot on the labor partys knesset list for the march  elections baraks attempt to return to a prominent role in israel politics seemed to have failed however peretzs hold on the labor leadership proved unexpectedly shaky as he was badly damaged by negative views of his performance as defense minister during the  lebanon war which was seen as something less than a success in israel in january  barak launched a bid to recapture the leadership of the labor party in a letter acknowledging mistakes and inexperience during his tenure as prime minister in early march  a poll of labor party primary voters put barak ahead of all other opponents including peretz in the first round of voting on  may  he gained  of the votes more than his two closest rivals but not enough to win the election as a result barak faced a runoff against the secondplace finisher ami ayalon on  june  which he won by a narrow margin barak has been critical of what he sees as racist sentiments that have recently been expressed by some israeli rabbis and rebbetzins he views such statements as a threat to israeli unity and that they may lead

minister of defense on  june  as part of prime minister olmerts cabinet reshuffle however on  july  barak led a successful effort in the labor central committee to stipulate that labor would leave the government coalition if olmert did not resign by september or october  at that time the winograd commission would publish its final report on the performance of the israel defense forces and its civilian leadership the preliminary winograd report released earlier this year laid most of the blame on olmert for poorly planning executing and reviewing war strategies in the  conflict against hezbollah from december  to january  barak led operation cast lead labor won only  out of the  knesset seats in the  elections making them the fourth largest party barak and other labor officials initially stated they would not take part in the next government however over the objections of some in the labor party barak laterwhen reached an agreement under which labor joined the governing coalition barak retained his position as defense minister leaving the labor party in january  labor party leader barak formed a breakaway party independence which enabled him to maintain his loyal labors mk faction within netanyahus government and prevented the departure of labor party as a whole from netanyahus coalitiongovernment labor previously threatened to force barak to do so after baraks move netanyahu was able to maintain a majority of  mk out of  in the knesset previously having  mks within his majority coalition in february  barak attended a ceremony at the un for the

but postponed it till later that year barak stated during an american television interview that he would probably strive for nuclear weapons if he were in irans position adding i dont delude myself that they are doing it just because of israel this comment has been criticized and compared to baraks comment in  during a television interview when he said that if he were a palestinian he would

ghana you are received immediately barak confirmed that he has been received by these heads of state but denied earning money from opening doors for international business deals for israeli and foreign corporations and said he does not see any ethical or moral problems in his business activities he further said there is no logic to demand of him after the natural process in democracy has ended to not utilize the tools he accumulated in his career to secure his financial future when asked if his financial worth is  million dollars barak said im not far from there references in popular

resumed peace negotiations with the plo stating that every attempt by the state of israel to keep hold of this area the west bank and gaza as one political entity leads necessarily to either a

would not run for a spot on the labor partys knesset list for the march  elections baraks attempt to return to a prominent role in israel politics seemed to have failed however peretzs hold on the

israel in january  barak launched a bid to recapture the leadership of the labor party in a letter acknowledging mistakes and inexperience during his tenure as prime minister in early march  a poll of labor party primary voters put barak ahead of all other opponents including peretz in the first round of voting on  may  he gained  of the votes more than his two closest rivals but not enough to win

released earlier this year laid most of the blame on olmert for poorly planning executing and reviewing war strategies in the  conflict against hezbollah from december  to january  barak led operation cast lead labor won only  out of the  knesset seats in the  elections making them the fourth largest party barak and other labor officials initially stated they would not take part in the next government however over the objections of some in the labor party barak laterwhen reached an agreement under which labor joined the governing coalition barak retained his position as defense minister

barak at the pentagon  in the  prime ministerial election barak beat benjamin netanyahu by a wide margin however he sparked controversy by deciding to form a coalition with the ultraorthodox party shas who had won an unprecedented  seats in the seat knesset shas grudgingly agreed to baraks terms that they eject their leader aryeh deri a convicted felon and enact reform to clean up inparty corruption consequentially the left wing meretz party quit the coalition after they failed to agree on the powers to be given to a shas deputy minister in the ministry of education in  barak gave a campaign promise to end israels yearlong occupation of southern lebanon within a year on  may  israel withdrew from southern lebanon on  october three israeli soldiers were killed in a border raid by hezbollah and their bodies were subsequently captured the bodies of these soldiers along with the living elhanan tenenbaum were eventually exchanged for lebanese captives in  the barak government resumed peace negotiations with the plo stating that every attempt by the state of israel to keep hold of this area the west bank and gaza as one political entity leads necessarily to either a nondemocratic or a nonjewish state because if the palestinians vote then it is a binational state and if they dont vote it is an apartheid state as part of these negotiations barak took part in the camp david  summit which was meant finally to resolve the israeli–palestinian conflict but failed barak also allowed foreign minister shlomo benami to attend the taba summit with the leadership of the

after peres lost the race to amir peretz and left the labor party barak announced he would stay at the party despite his shaky relationship with its newly elected leader he declared however that he would not run for a spot on the labor partys knesset list for the march  elections baraks attempt to return to a prominent role in israel politics seemed to have failed however peretzs hold on the labor leadership proved unexpectedly shaky as he was badly damaged by negative views of his performance as defense minister during the  lebanon war which was seen as something less than a success in israel in january  barak launched a bid to recapture the leadership of the labor party in a letter acknowledging mistakes and inexperience during his tenure as prime minister in early march  a poll of labor party primary voters put barak ahead of all other opponents including peretz in the first round of voting on  may  he gained  of the votes more than his two closest rivals but not enough to win the election as a result barak faced a runoff against the secondplace finisher ami ayalon on  june  which he won by a narrow margin barak has been critical of what he sees as racist sentiments that have recently been expressed by some israeli rabbis and rebbetzins he views such statements as a threat to israeli unity and that they may lead israeli society into a dark and dangerous place defense minister ehud barak and condoleezza rice  as head of the labor party after winning back the leadership of the labor party barak was sworn in as minister of defense on  june  as part of prime minister olmerts cabinet reshuffle however on  july  barak led a successful effort in the labor central committee to stipulate that labor would leave the government coalition if olmert did not resign by september or october  at that time the winograd commission would publish its final report on the performance of the israel defense forces and its civilian leadership the preliminary winograd report released earlier this year laid most of the blame on olmert for poorly planning executing and reviewing war strategies in the  conflict against hezbollah from december  to january  barak led operation cast lead labor won only  out of the  knesset seats in the  elections making them the fourth largest party barak and other labor officials initially stated they would not take part in the next government however over the objections of some in the labor party barak laterwhen reached an agreement under which labor joined the governing coalition barak retained his position as defense minister leaving the labor party in january  labor party leader barak formed a breakaway party independence which enabled him to maintain his loyal labors mk faction within netanyahus government and prevented the departure of labor party as a whole from netanyahus coalitiongovernment labor previously threatened to force barak to do so after baraks move netanyahu was able to maintain a majority of  mk out of  in the knesset previously having  mks within his majority coalition in february  barak attended a ceremony at the un for the international day of commemoration in memory of the victims of the holocaust barak told the un general assembly an independent strong thriving and peaceful state of israel is the vengeance of the dead on this day when we remember the six million victims let us also remember two lessons first the holocaust – never again and second – an independent strong thriving and peaceful state of israel is the vengeance of the dead in  baraks independence party was due to run for election but decided not to choosing to quit politics barak planned to quit since operation pillar of defense and the gaza war but postponed it till later that year barak stated during an american television interview that he would probably strive for nuclear weapons if he were in irans position adding i dont delude myself that they are doing it just because of israel this comment has been criticized and compared to baraks comment in  during a television interview when he said that if he were a palestinian he would probably have joined one of the terror organizations wealth in an interview with haaretz reported in january  barak was asked to explain the source of his big capital with which he bought  apartments and connected them and by which he lives in a giant rental

been received by these heads of state but denied earning money from opening doors for international business deals for israeli and foreign corporations and said he does not see any ethical or moral problems in his business activities he further said there is no logic to demand of him after the natural process in democracy has ended to not utilize the tools he accumulated in his career to secure his financial future when asked if his financial worth is  million dollars barak said im not far from there references in popular culture the film munich includes a scene reflecting the real baraks experience leading his sayeret matkal unit in the commando raid operation spring of youth he is mentioned by name and appears disguised as a woman in high heels while firing on presumed plo leaders

tzipi livni left israeli likud party leader benjamin netanyahu center and israeli defense minister and labor party leader ehud barak attend an economic conference in tel aviv israel monday dec  ap photoariel schalit ariel schalitap by ehud barak by ehud barak september   ehud barak was prime minister of israel from  to  and defense minister from  to  and  to  during the past two years a sense of gloom has taken over my country as pride in israel’s accomplishments and selfconfidence grounded in reality have given way to fearmongering victimhood and internal quarrels prime minister benjamin netanyahu enabled a militant nationalist minority to carry out a hostile takeover of his party likud to form a majority in his cabinet and thus to hijack our national agenda in the service of a messianic drive toward as it’s often put “a single jewish state from the jordan river to the mediterranean sea” this overarching ambition is bound to culminate in either a single binational state which within a generation may have a jewish minority and likely a bosnialike civil war or else an apartheid reality if palestinian residents are deprived of the right to vote both spell doom for the zionist dream netanyahu’s reckless conduct has also undermined israel’s security israel has reached a new militaryaid agreement for the next decade with the united states the damage produced by netanyahu’s irresponsible management of the relations with the white house is now fully manifest israel will receive  billion a year — an important contribution to our security but far less than what could have been obtained before the prime minister chose to blatantly interfere with us politics moreover given the more than  percent cumulative rise in the cost of arms since the last year agreement entered into force in  the newly agreedupon amount represents no greater purchasing power — and even these funds will be conditioned on israel refraining from requesting additional funding from congress accentuating the degree of mistrust according to new details reported wednesday the administration secured an israeli written commitment to return any additional money that congress might provide in the past congress has added — with white house consent —  million to  million every year for iron dome and other defense systems additionally israel will have to accept a gradual reduction of more than  million a year in funds for our defense industries consequently either vital security projects will be canceled or the same amount will be reduced from important domestic programs expressing our opposition to the iran nuclear deal was certainly legitimate but instead of holding a candid dialogue behind closed doors with president obama netanyahu went behind his back to deliver a speech to congress shaking the foundations of bipartisan support for israel and dividing jewish opinion likewise at home netanyahu has consistently nourished fear of existential threats and unleashed ghosts of enemies from within when domestic realities called for unity and confidence and regional developments required a sober assessment and steady hand the middle east is a tough neighborhood hezbollah hamas the islamic state and a more potent iran are not imaginary adversaries yet as a former prime minister defense minister and israel defense forces chief of staff i state unequivocally while never to be taken lightly none of these forces constitutes an existential threat despite seven wars two intifadas and a host of military operations israel has emerged as the most successful nationbuilding project of the th century powerful scientifically economically and militarily with a vibrant culture what made this possible is sorely lacking today a vision that unifies an action plan that is realistic and bold farsighted leadership that navigates both while holding a compass not a weather vane israel needs a policy that restores credibility to our relations with washington prioritizes the unity of the people over the unity of the land enhances security via cooperation with likeminded nations and promotes democratic values rather than messianic visions our people need a policy that does not seek shelter in arguing over the availability of a palestinian partner but rather takes the initiative by implementing the security first plan recently presented by more than  of israel’s most respected former top commanders the plan would bolster our security while preserving the twostate option and prospects for regional cooperation israeli airforce hits several targets in gaza during the night after palestinian militants fired a rocket towards israel reuters under security first israel would withdraw none of its forces and hold overall responsibility for security over the west bank as a “security deposit” until an agreement with the palestinians ushered in other security arrangements it calls for completion of the security fence around the west bank major settlement blocks a freeze on israeli construction activities east of the fence legislating a voluntary evacuationcompensation law to enable settlers who wish to relocate west of the fence to do so establishing an administrative council and funding a development plan for the palestinian neighborhoods in east jerusalem securing the status quo in all holy sites authorizing palestinian infrastructure agriculture and housing development in the  percent of the west bank that is under israeli control and issuing an unequivocal israeli statement reiterating its commitment to a negotiated twostate solution and announcing that israel has no claim to sovereignty over palestinian areas beyond the security fence an alternative policy would also welcome the opportunity for an international conference on middle east issues with leading moderate muslim countries and embrace the arab peace initiative as a basis for negotiations subject to certain essential modifications we are strong and should be self confident enough to take the initiative failure to alter the current course will exacerbate the challenges to israel’s security wellbeing international standing and domestic cohesiveness on the other hand acting decisively will secure the israel we fought for and unleash the talent and resourcefulness of our people to attain asyetuntold achievements if the government doesn’t steer away from its dangerous path it will have to be replaced by a more responsible attentive and courageous one — headed by whomever the people choose read more on this topic josh

retired for good from politics before his country’s last election in  the move came after he had made a comeback as leader of the labor party serving as defense minister for  years under two different prime ministers since then barak has concentrated on making money in the world of business panetta has remained a close friend of barak’s one of the former prime minister’s few remaining friends in fact in his final years in government barak’s political weakness discouraged the last of his traditional followers it was easy to see he had been deadended in his last position as defense minister by the media and—more importantly in israel’s tiny and intimate society—by a public that had grown to loathe him perhaps those were the reasons for his decision to give up and leave to places where he was still appreciated the former world leader’s rebirth began in  at the world economic conference of  in davos switzerland barak spoke about the threat that iran poses the world and the audience ate up every word then while speaking again at the traditional dinner held in davos barak surprised many with a liberal message regarding the then social protests in israel a few months later after his retirement from politics julius baer the swiss giant private investment bank aka the “jewish bank ” offered barak a position julius baer was at the time expanding its presence in israel julius baer group’s clientele include the uberwealthy of the world heirs entrepreneurs senior politicians and celebrities they are all people who want the discreet services offered by the swiss system having survived the banking crisis of  as well as the us assault on swiss banks accused of facilitating money laundering julius baer’s clients’ overall holdings stood at the end of june  at  billion swiss franks roughly  billion with its headquarters in zurich the bank has some   employees in  countries with an extensive presence in east asia the jewish baer family its controlling shareholder established the bank more than a century ago they fled to the us during the holocaust and over the last decade have been helping jews who sued swiss banks to release their dormant accounts from the holocaust these accounts total more than a billion dollars alfred baer founded the swiss technion society and headed it for about thirty years he was also the leader of keren hayesod switzerland and has donated millions to jewish organizations around the world barak was appointed special advisor to the management of the bank and its global ceo boris collardi in geopolitical issues and macroeconomics he will help formulate a business strategy this in spite of not having previously been a businessman for this role barak has apparently been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year this raised eyebrows among israelis living in zurich strategic consulting which strategy whether the bank is going to capture the oil fields in iran or intervene in the war in syria deputy director general of the bank in latin american and israel stephen kemp admitted “barak’s appointment has a fantastic effect for us when our ceo comes to any event with barak to be honest it is a very big contribution it definitely helps us in business” investment bankers from around the world who come to israel looking for great deals are always thrilled to have a chance to meet a celebrity like barak a former israeli prime minister defense minister legendary commander of sayeret matkal the idf’s most elite special forces unit and a former idf chief of staff barak however did say that he was not supposed to drive customers to the bank and does not work in israel but the bank’s business development people have offered a meeting with barak during conversations conducted with potential customers “perhaps you would like to meet for lunch or coffee with ehud barak ” asked one who tried to bring potential clients from zurich to tel aviv hoping to set up a meeting “did you come to meet barak and become a new customer of the bank right after” i asked one of the potential customers “in the end i announced that i am not interested ” he answered a few years earlier in early  julius baer tried to eliminate the wikileaks website which published documents belonging to the bank that cast suspicions that it had cooperated in the alleged tax evasion by its clients as well as in money laundering the bank has sought a court order in san francisco to shut down wikileaksorg but the move backfired as wikileaks released numerous documents on multiple alternative sites ultimately the court held that the request to block the site raised “serious questions about prior restraint and a possible violation of the first amendment” it is hard to exaggerate the impact this made on the banking and insurance sectors worldwide even the conservative europeans understood the crucial necessity of up to date high quality cyber security it led to real fears among the world’s bankers regarding threats to their cyber security this in part justified barak’s hiring ehud barak was there to help the bank understand these issue after all the world has attributed to israel and the united states the credit for the cyberattacks on iran’s nuclear facilities the idf had also defined cyber space as a combat field just like real land sea and air zones world governments are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in defense of cyberspace and the numbers are growing by double digits every year the israeli defense forces also produce young and experienced experts in the field of cyber security who go on to work in the private sector these include software developers willing and able to translate their knowledge into the development of systems to protect the infrastructure of banks in january  ehud barak was appointed to the position of director of cifc corp holding company which manages structured credit products and assets worth  billion and provides investment management services and financial advice through subsidiaries  of it was acquired in december  by a subsidiary of kolombosnovah this company’s address just happens to be the same as ehud barak’s cifc corp was founded in  employs  people and is traded on the nasdaq with a market value of   million as of the end of october  in  its board of directors convened only  times in june  the company allotted barak and each of its directors an additional   shares valued at about  each that came to   per person in the past the company paid approximately   to directors and   in annual fees not a large sum by anyone’s measure columbus nova group which has been linked to barak is controlled by one of the largest conglomerates in russia renova group owned by viktor vekselberg it trades in energy gold and telecommunications vekselberg founded it in  with his friend len blavatnik blavatnik is known to israelis in part because it acquired clal industries renova acquired several large aluminum plants in russia and later

involved in venture capital and private equity under the name columbus nova techology partners one of the managers there is yaron eitan an israeli one of the pioneers of israel’s hightech who now lives in new jersey in april this year by the way barak was interviewed by russian news channel rt and showered unexpected compliments on the putin regime the interview caused a stir in israel and around the world it was conducted in the offices of “smrook kazina ” a company belonging to the government of kazakhstan barak often travels to that country and the scope of his business there is unknown in april of  yaron eitan acquired a company called cyalume technologies inc for about  million cyalume specializes in among other things light emitting chemical products such as glow in the

estimated market value was only  million recently barak’s name was mentioned as possibly representing investors in the privatization of israel’s military industry then justice minister tzipi livni criticized this move journalist stella korin lieber wrote in globes that according to security sources “the privatization of imi may turn into a new battleground between ehud barak and gabi ashkenazi former idf chief of staff this time it is over billions of dollars and many multinational jobs and so their dark secrets are expected to be revealed to the world” in the past decade israeli minister yair shamir served as chairman of iai three years ago shamir asked then defense minister barak to extend his tenure but barak refused eventually shamir decided to enter politics and joined avigdor lieberman’s yisrael beiteinu the bad blood still flows between shamir and barak shamir the departing agriculture minister said a few months ago in a closed meeting “at the time of my appointment in  as chairman of iai barak met with me he was then a businessman he invited me to the office offered me a drink even though it was early morning ‘you and i can do many things together ’ said barak” barak also informed shamir about who wanted to invest in and even buy iai “let’s cooperate ” he said a furious shamir replied “you forget who you’re talking to ” got up and left since the two men have

also knew that after seeing their coconspirator madoff get sent to jail for  years they could risk going to jail themselves full storygoogle ivan pictetmonty raphael  jackloach pts sods  law may   updated for almost two decades we have strived to get justice for the injustice we have suffered at the hands of a world renowned bank pictet  cie bank two yorkshiremen both running their own small family businesses trying to resolve the problem by taking all the correct legal procedures to recover their monies the matter was raised in parliament – twice the fsa investigated the matter concluding that pictet had rogues operating in their london bank  but the rogues had left saying no one left to prosecute  so there we then approached the financial ombudsman service fos  our case was dealt with by seven different people  then our numerous emails were ignored  nobody would speak to us so there we then asked the sfo  serious fraud office to investigate our case  the criteria of our case ticked all their boxes  we were instructed not to send them any documentsevidence in fact they wrote to us advising us to go to the citizens advice bureaucab richard alderman the sfo boss  who responded to our letter was the same man who would not investigate the “ madoff” scandal or the “libor” fiasco the mps committee  said he was sloppy and the sfo was run like “ fred karnos circus”  it was an office of fraud so there our mp approached our local chief constable to investigate he was called sir norman bettison chief constable of west yorkshire police  a force that made “ dads army” look like the sas they were inept – corrupt malicious  from top to bottom we were criminally dealt with by the forces solicitor the head of the economic crime unit and the chief constable  so there we were then advised to pass our complaint against west yorkshire police to the ipcc – which we did  they advised us to make our complaint to  the west yorkshire police  we did with reluctance  all we got was abuse and obfuscation  so there sir norman bettison  the forces solicitor and the head of the economic crime  have all been removed from their posts and facing criminal allegations  so there we even sought justice through the courts  culminating in a visit to the court of appeallondon on leaving the courts of appeal that day our barrister a “rising star” informed us  that if that was british justice then you can keep it he quit the law and moved to canada  so there a few years later we learned that one of the judges  lord justice in our case at the court of appeal was related to a senior executive of the pictet bank so there the ministry of justice passed our case to lord myners to investigate  we would rather have had mickey mouse or donald duck do it  to this day we dont know whether he did anything or not  probably not  seeing that his wife was on the pictet prix board pictet  cie bank  voted private bank of the year  ivan pictet  voted banker of the year   the senior partner  lied on numerous occasions and had documents destroyed  also said genuine documents were forgeries  so there pictet  cie were adamant that they had no involvement with madoff  they lied again  they let him steal the monies then conned it off him so there   june – published in anglo info geneva – usa trust fund investors were sent false and fraudulent documents by pictet bank in order to collect large fees  like madoff even after the sec in the usa uncovered the fraud pictet continued to charge fees and drain whatever was left in these accounts estimated that  million lost in this

high court  the fsa  and the police fraud squad so there monty raphaelqc became an honorary queens counsellor in march  monty raphaelqc became a master of the bench in nov an expert in fraud the doyen of fraud lawyers  so there this says a lot about banks  and their lawyers the consensus of opinion is that they are highly paid “crooks”  no wonder they voted ivan pictet banker of the year  and monty

servicestechnologytechnology news apr    this post is also available in עברית hebrew israeli startup ‘reporty homeland security’ has raised  million from former prime minister and minister of defense ehud barak the company’s purpose is to improve and streamline communication between citizens and government agencies while they say taking precautions to protect users’ privacy ‘reporty homeland security’ is currently developing a global platform for realtime reporting especially useful during emergencies in the reporty press release statement ehud barak said the company “provides an answer to the essential need of every citizen – a sense of security based on immediate and easy access to emergency services including municipalities hospitals airports police fire and rescue etc” barak’s investment will accelerate product development allow the company to hire more people and distribute its system to emergency services and government organizations jewish business news describes a situation where emergency and government agencies receive hundreds of millions of calls every year the average time of such a call is  –  minutes during which time the center professionals must try to quickly assess the situation identify the caller’s location as well as evaluate the credibility of the report and of the individual making the call – all this in order to make a quick decision about the best and most effective use of the resources on hand experts note that a vast amount of effort is invested in this process of assessment clarification identification and evaluation especially since  to  percent of the calls to emergency help centers are false alarms for example  out of the nine million calls made annually to magen david adom israel’s equivalent of the red cross are nuisance calls quick identification of the caller’s location is also essential in the united states about  people a year die due to failure on the part of emergency and rescue forces to identify their correct location in time reporty’s goal is to change this making the reporting of an emergency as well as the reception of the report at the emergency help center more efficient reporty offers an application that works through a broadcast video in real time so that with the click of a button twoway video and audio is transmitted to the appropriate emergency center including accurate data about the location and the report’s degree of credibility according to homeland security news wire the application also allows for communication with predesignated “guardians” that is people designated by the user as individuals capable of helping them in emergencies reporty’s solution combines a smartphone app and a command and control system installed at emergency centers the company notes that its system may also be installed at sites such as airports and company premises subscribe to our newsletter similar articles leveraging social media during emergency jul    creative solution to secure

adopt nuclear deal with iran  netanyahu to obama deal with iran funds its terror and war machine  analysis battling obama in congress shaping up as loselose proposition byariel ben solomon gil stern stern hoffman jpostcom staff july    arab mks israel should be denuclearized share on facebook share on twitter ehud barak photo creditmarc israel sellemthe jerusalem post the nuclear deal that the world’s leading countries reached with iran on tuesday will likely lead to the islamic republic becoming a nuclear power but israel can live with a nuclear iran because israel is by far the strongest country in the region so said former prime minister and defense minister ehud barak in an interview with channel  tuesday nightbarak was just one of many israeli politicians across the political spectrum who slammed the deal mks from the joint list were the only ones who praised it be the first to know  join our facebook page “the agreement gives legitimacy to iran to become a nuclear threshold state” barak said “it allows the iranians to subsidize terror and removes them from the noose of sanctions it is fair to say that it will allow iran to follow north korea to become a nuclear power”however while he said it was legitimate for israeli politicians to go to the us to explain why the deal was problematic for israel he cautioned against interfering in american politics and said positive relations with the white house must be restored he added that there was room to take advantage of the nuclear deal to set a new regional security order “we need to define together with america what a smoking gun is and what is an iranian violation” he said “you don’t need to be a security expert to understand that the deal changes the security situation you need the us to reevaluate the situation and maintain and develop the military option”meanwhile opposition leader isaac herzog zionist union announced that he would be leaving for the us in the coming days to “demand a dramatic package of security measures for israel”voicing his disappointment over the deal at a knesset press conference herzog said he had been in talks with aipac and other bodies in the us and that he intended to fly there as soon as possible to “clarify the nature of the risks stemming from the agreement as pertains to israel and the rest of the region”“with regard to security i am more extreme than prime minister benjamin netanyahu” herzog said “in light of the situation we must do everything within our power to improve our security i have full confidence in the power of the state of israel and the unity and the power of our society to face and overcome any challenge and risks that lie in its path even if there are internal disputes israel knows how to unite and fight together for security” netanyahu convenes security cabinet israel not bound by deal with iranyesh atid leader yair lapid intends to lobby congressmen to vote against the deal which he said made tuesday “a bad day for the jewish people” what does the iran nuclear deal mean for israeleducation minister naftali bennett went further declaring that “this day will be remembered as a black day in the history of the free world” he spoke out against the deal on cnn immediately after the network broadcast speeches by the american and iranian presidents praising the deal“the history books have been rewritten again today and this period will be deemed particularly grave and dangerous” bennett said “western citizens who get up for another day at work or school are not aware of the fact that about half a trillion dollars has been transferred to the hands of a terrorist superpower the most dangerous country in the world which has promised the destruction of nations and peoples today it may be us tomorrow it may reach every country in the form of suitcase bombs in london or new york israel has done everything possible to warn of danger and in the end it will follow its own interests and will do whatever it takes to defend itself”yisrael beytenu leader avigdor liberman warned that “the agreement with iran will be remembered in history the same way as the munich agreement that led to world war ii and the agreement with north korea that led to its nuclearization”calling the deal “a total surrender to terror and unbridled violence in the international arena” he stressed that israel “needs to ensure at all times and in all circumstances that it will defend itself today israel needs to remember the talmudic axiom ‘if i am not for myself who will be for me’” meanwhile the likud criticized opposition lawmakers for assailing netanyahu’s policies in light of the nuclear agreement“instead of presenting a unified front on a fateful issue for israel on which there is no right or left and on which everyone knows israel’s security is at stake some politicians are engaging in narrow political prattle at the expense of the interests of israel” the party said in a statement “the prime minister never promised that there would not be a deal only that iran would not obtain nuclear weapons and that promise still holds today more than ever”the joint list however welcomed the nuclear deal saying in a statement that it was “a victory for the will of the iranian people and its struggle to remove the siege and sanctions” it added that israel should now dismantle its own purported nuclear weapons programisrael’s objections to the deal are based on its aim “to remain the only country with nuclear power in the region and to distract the international community from the occupation which is the source of tension war and instability in the middle east” said the predominantly arab party“we have to keep the region free from nuclear weapons” it addedthe list’s arab nationalist balad party and islamic movementaffiliated united arab list party signed off on the statement even though their ideologies seem to dovetail with those of the larger islamic and sunni world – which opposes shi’ite iran’s regional ambitions and is likely to be critical of the deal share on facebook share on twitter tags israel iran nuclear related content july   salomon family’s invited public to grandson’s

defense committee following internal elections after peres defeat in the election for prime minister in  barak became the leader of the labor party prime minister of israel barak at the pentagon  in the  prime ministerial election barak beat benjamin netanyahu by a wide margin however he sparked controversy by deciding to form a coalition with the ultraorthodox party shas who had won an unprecedented  seats in the seat knesset shas grudgingly agreed to baraks terms that they eject their leader aryeh deri a convicted felon and enact reform to clean up inparty corruption consequentially the left wing meretz party quit the coalition after they failed to agree on the powers to be given to a shas deputy minister in the ministry of education in  barak gave a campaign promise to end israels yearlong occupation of southern lebanon within a year on  may  israel withdrew from southern lebanon on  october three israeli soldiers were killed in a border raid by hezbollah and their bodies were subsequently captured the bodies of these soldiers along with the living elhanan tenenbaum were eventually exchanged for lebanese captives in  the barak government resumed peace negotiations with the plo stating that every attempt by the state of israel to keep hold of this area the west bank and gaza as one political entity leads necessarily to either a nondemocratic or a nonjewish state because if the palestinians vote then it is a binational state and if they dont vote it is an apartheid state as part of these negotiations barak took part in the camp david  summit

spot on the labor partys knesset list for the march  elections baraks attempt to return to a prominent role in israel politics seemed to have failed however peretzs hold on the labor leadership proved unexpectedly shaky as he was badly damaged by negative views of his performance as defense minister during the  lebanon war which was seen as something less than a success in israel in january  barak

at that time the winograd commission would publish its final report on the performance of the israel defense forces and its civilian leadership the preliminary winograd report released earlier this year laid most of the blame on olmert for poorly planning executing and reviewing war strategies in the  conflict against hezbollah from december  to january  barak led operation cast lead labor won

attempt by the state of israel to keep hold of this area the west bank and gaza as one political entity leads necessarily to either a nondemocratic or a nonjewish state because if the palestinians

partys knesset list for the march  elections baraks attempt to return to a prominent role in israel politics seemed to have failed however peretzs hold on the labor leadership proved unexpectedly

bid to recapture the leadership of the labor party in a letter acknowledging mistakes and inexperience during his tenure as prime minister in early march  a poll of labor party primary voters put barak ahead of all other opponents including peretz in the first round of voting on  may  he gained  of the votes more than his two closest rivals but not enough to win the election as a result barak

only  out of the  knesset seats in the  elections making them the fourth largest party barak and other labor officials initially stated they would not take part in the next government however over the objections of some in the labor party barak laterwhen reached an agreement under which labor joined the governing coalition barak retained his position as defense minister leaving the labor party in

the labor party prime minister of israel barak at the pentagon  in the  prime ministerial election barak beat benjamin netanyahu by a wide margin however he sparked controversy by deciding to form a coalition with the ultraorthodox party shas who had won an unprecedented  seats in the seat knesset shas grudgingly agreed to baraks terms that they eject their leader aryeh deri a convicted felon and enact reform to clean up inparty corruption consequentially the left wing meretz party quit the coalition after they failed to agree on the powers to be given to a shas deputy minister in the ministry of education in  barak gave a campaign promise to end israels yearlong occupation of southern lebanon within a year on  may  israel withdrew from southern lebanon on  october three israeli soldiers were killed in a border raid by hezbollah and their bodies were subsequently captured the bodies of these soldiers along with the living elhanan tenenbaum were eventually exchanged for lebanese captives in  the barak government resumed peace negotiations with the plo stating that every attempt by the state of israel to keep hold of this area the west bank and gaza as one political entity leads necessarily to either a nondemocratic or a nonjewish state because if the palestinians vote then it is a binational state and if they dont vote it is an apartheid state as part of these

which is thought to have made over nis  million after peres lost the race to amir peretz and left the labor party barak announced he would stay at the party despite his shaky relationship with its newly elected leader he declared however that he would not run for a spot on the labor partys knesset list for the march  elections baraks attempt to return to a prominent role in israel politics seemed to have failed however peretzs hold on the labor leadership proved unexpectedly shaky as he was badly damaged by negative views of his performance as defense minister during the  lebanon war which was seen as something less than a success in israel in january  barak launched a bid to recapture the leadership of the labor party in a letter acknowledging mistakes and inexperience during his tenure as prime minister in early march  a poll of labor party primary voters put barak ahead of all other opponents including peretz in the first round of voting on  may  he gained  of the votes more than his two closest rivals but not enough to win the election as a result barak faced a runoff against the secondplace finisher ami ayalon on  june  which he won by a narrow margin barak has been critical of what he sees as racist sentiments that have recently been expressed by some israeli rabbis and rebbetzins he views such statements as a threat to israeli unity and that they may lead israeli society into a dark and dangerous place defense minister ehud barak and condoleezza rice  as head of the labor party after winning back the leadership of the labor party barak was sworn in as minister of defense on  june  as part of prime minister olmerts cabinet reshuffle however on  july  barak led a successful effort in the labor central committee to stipulate that labor would leave the government coalition if olmert did not resign by september or october  at that time the winograd commission would publish its final report on the performance of the israel defense forces and its civilian leadership the preliminary winograd report released earlier this year laid most of the blame on olmert for poorly planning executing and reviewing war strategies in the  conflict against hezbollah from december  to january  barak led operation cast lead labor won only  out of the  knesset seats in the  elections making them the fourth largest party barak and other labor officials initially stated they would not take part in the next government however over the objections of some in the labor party barak laterwhen reached an agreement under which labor joined the governing coalition barak retained his position as defense minister leaving the labor party in january  labor party leader barak formed a breakaway party independence which enabled him to maintain his loyal labors mk faction within netanyahus government and prevented the departure of labor party as a whole from netanyahus coalitiongovernment labor previously threatened to force barak to do so after baraks move netanyahu was able to maintain a majority of  mk out of  in the knesset previously having  mks within his majority coalition in february  barak attended a ceremony at the un for the

on this day when we remember the six million victims let us also remember two lessons first the holocaust – never again and second – an independent strong thriving and peaceful state of israel is the vengeance of the dead in  baraks independence party was due to run for election but decided not to choosing to quit politics barak planned to quit since operation pillar of defense and the gaza war but postponed it till later that year barak stated during an american television interview that he would probably strive for nuclear weapons if he were in irans position adding i dont delude myself that they are doing it just because of israel this comment has been criticized and compared to baraks comment in  during a television interview when he said that if he were a palestinian he would probably have joined one of the terror organizations wealth in an interview with haaretz reported in january  barak was asked to explain the source of his big capital with which he bought  apartments and connected them and by which he lives in a giant rental apartment in a luxury high rise barak said he currently earns more than a million dollars a year and that from  he also earned more than a

ghana you are received immediately barak confirmed that he has been received by these heads of state but denied earning money from opening doors for international business deals for israeli and foreign corporations and said he does not see any ethical or moral problems in his business activities he further said there is no logic to demand of him after the natural process in democracy has ended to not utilize the tools he accumulated in his career to secure his financial future when asked if his financial worth is  million dollars barak said im not far from there references in popular

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
