mortgagebacked securities mbs are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage loans most commonly on residential property mortgage loans are purchased from banks mortgage companies and other originators and then assembled into pools by a governmental quasigovernmental or private entity the entity then issues securities that represent claims on the principal and interest payments made by borrowers on the loans in the pool a process known as securitization most mbss are issued by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae a us government agency or the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac us governmentsponsored enterprises ginnie mae backed by the full faith and credit of the us government guarantees that investors receive timely payments fannie mae and freddie mac also provide certain guarantees and while not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government have special authority to borrow from the us treasury some private institutions such as brokerage firms banks and homebuilders also securitize mortgages known as privatelabel mortgage securities mortgagebacked securities exhibit a variety of structures the most basic types are passthrough participation certificates which entitle the holder to a prorata share of all principal and interest payments made on the pool of loan assets more complicated mbss known as collaterized mortgage obligations or mortgage derivatives may be designed to protect investors from or expose investors to various types of risk an important risk with regard to residential mortgages involves prepayments typically because homeowners refinance when interest rates fall absent protection such prepayments would return principal to investors precisely when their options for reinvesting those funds may be relatively unattractive   modified july   stay connected  twitter  facebook rss youtube  flickr

definitive rating assigned aa sf reflects interestonly class ratings rationale the certificates are collateralized by  fixed rate loans secured by  properties the ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the moodys stressed dscr of x is slightly higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the pooled trust loan balance of  million represents a moodys ltv ratio of  which is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of  moodys also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity when selecting a ratings approach with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level herfindahl score is  which is higher than the scores calculated for most multiborrower pools that moodys has rated since  with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl score is  moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the pools weighted average property quality grade is  which is worse than indices calculated in most multiborrower transactions since  the principal methodology used in this rating was approach to rating us and canadian conduitfusion cmbs published in december  please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys analysis employs the excelbased cmbs conduit model v which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loan level proceeds derived from moodys loan level dscr and ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure property type sponsorship and diversity moodys analysis also uses the cmbs io calculator ver which references the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit assessments original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated aaa sf super senior class would be aaa aa and aa respectively for the aa sf rated class as would be aa a and a respectively for the aa sf rated class b would be a a and baa respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by the issuer at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified by moodys b must be construed solely as a statement of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer invitation inducement or recommendation to purchase sell or hold any securities or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with any other matter moodys does not guarantee or make any representation or warranty as to the correctness of any information rating or communication relating to the issuer moodys shall not be liable in

negligence but excluding fraud dishonesty andor willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be excluded on the part of or any contingency beyond the control of moodys or any of its employees or agents including any losses arising from or in connection with the procurement compilation analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form moodys received and took into account one or more thirdparty assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a neutral impact on the credit rating further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each
