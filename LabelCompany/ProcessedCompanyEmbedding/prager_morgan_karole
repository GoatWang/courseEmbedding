the scene damage and injuries analyzing medical reports contacting expert witnesses to review evidence speaking with the insurance providers on your behalf the insurance company or negligent party from which you are attempting to collect compensation will work to categorize your injury as temporary rather than permanent your attorney can collect and organize evidence on your behalf to rebut the defendant’s claims car accident injuries and compensation because each accident is different the extent of injuries suffered will vary between cases in many cases the costs for treatment of the injuries sustained will not be covered by pip insurance and will require additional litigation or negotiations some injuries that we may attempt to collect compensation for include but are not limited to paralysis burns and scars loss of limbs spinal cord injuries head injuries joint muscle back neck and bone injuries knee damage whiplash permanent disability wrongful death if you have suffered any degree of injury contact us by filling out our free noobligation case review form economic auto accident damages also known as compensatory damages attempt to compensate the injured car crash victim

crash they may be able to recover the cost of future medical expenses lost wages car accident victims who have been injured can seek compensation for lost wages from the time of injury to the conclusion of the lawsuit even if the victim was unemployed he or she could receive compensation for lost wages if the attorney can prove that the accident limited his or her earning potential loss of earning capacity if you sustained injuries that prevent you from working you may be able to receive compensation by proving that your earning capacity was negatively impacted by the incident in this case the jury will typically determine the amount the victim could have earned if the car accident had not occurred noneconomic car accident damages award the plaintiff for nonfinancial losses car accident damages for nonmonetary losses are typically harder to quantify and may include compensation for the following pain and suffering this includes compensation for the pain and suffering you faced after the accident in awarding damages for pain and suffering the jury will examine the extent of your injuries including how long you are expected to suffer the nature of the injury and what financial burdens the incident places on you and your family mental anguish you may also be able to attain compensation for the emotional pain you faced after the incident mental anguish for example can include feelings of fright nervousness worry grief and any other type of emotional trauma a victim can face after a devastating accident loss of consortium the surviving spouse may be awarded

assistance aid society and companionship of their parents as a result of their wrongful death punitive damages if the actions of the defendant were so malicious or egregious the jury may impose punitive damages which are intended to punish the defendant and discourage similar behavior in the future seeking additional damages the strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect analyze and present evidence if you are seeking additional damages your attorney will approach the negligent party’s insurance company in an attempt to recover compensation to cover your remaining costs your claim will be submitted for approval to the insurance company which will have conducted an investigation of its own the strength and success of your

uninsured and underinsured motorist accidents after exhausting pip coverage if the other driver has no other insurance or an amount of coverage that is insufficient to cover the costs related to your injury your uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage may cover the damage caused by the negligent party if the negligent party was underinsured your insurance will cover the difference between your losses and the amount you received from the other party’s insurance company if you do not have this coverage you should contact an attorney to obtain compensation for injuries resulting from the accident an attorney may be able to seek damages from the negligent party’s homeowners’ insurance your own insurance carrier or your health insurance provider attempting to collect compensation through your uninsured motorist coverage can be complicated and will likely require the assistance of an experienced attorney your insurance company may try to limit your payout based on their own investigation of the accident and how much they believe your claim is worth if you receive an amount that you believe does not properly cover your losses your attorney may be able to file a lawsuit against your insurance company in an attempt to recover additional compensation types of car accident claims “nofault” insurance law attempts to limit the number of lawsuits filed over minor car accidents civil suits to recover additional compensation for personal injury damages are only permitted under certain circumstances such as negligence most car accidents rely on the concept of negligence or the party’s failure to exercise a certain level of caution while operating a vehicle or using common roads negligence is one of the most common factors in accidents that harm other motorists pedestrians or bicyclists to prove negligence your attorney will conduct a preliminary investigation to identify who was responsible for the accident to have the best chances of receiving compensation the attorney must prove that the defendant failed to meet a reasonable standard of care and that his or her negligence caused the accident some examples of defendants are negligent drivers reckless drivers intoxicated drivers and bus drivers manufacturer liability if your vehicle or the other party’s vehicle had a defect contributed to the accident the injured party may have a claim against the manufacturer of the vehicle or one of its parts if the car had a faulty design or a manufacturing and labeling issue the manufacturer can be held responsible regardless of who was actually at fault for the accident to prevail your attorney must prove that you were not at fault for the accident as the defect that caused the accident occurred during the manufacturing process oftentimes expert testimony and analysis is used as evidence to prove that the defect contributed in some way to the accident successful lawsuits will require the plaintiff to show the defective car or part was “unreasonably dangerous” the vehicle was being operated as intended the vehicle’s performance had not changed since its initial purchase claims are usually filed against manufacturers in the case of defective parts such as seat belts airbags accelerators brakes and engines road design in some cases faulty construction design or maintenance of roads can contribute to accidents some common causes include embankments when a road curves the outer edge is set at an incline as a safety precaution these raised areas serve the purpose of managing traffic so that vehicles can approach the outer edge of the road without driving off it if the embankment is too steep or not elevated properly motorists may be in danger barriers and guard rails barriers guard rails speed bumps medians and curbs help to influence safe driving if any of these structures are poorly designed or placed driver safety may be compromised surfaces various alterations in road surface alert drivers of approaching hazards or that they are leaving their lane unexpectedly signage signs give drivers prior notice of approaching intersections sharp turns animal crossings etc they should be positioned in obvious locations and brightly illuminated for maximum visibility traffic control traffic lights stop and yield signs lights to warn drivers of intersections and crosswalks and other devices are utilized to dictate traffic flow proper placement and operation of these devices are imperative wrongful death if you have lost a loved one in a car crash you may have legal recourse through a
