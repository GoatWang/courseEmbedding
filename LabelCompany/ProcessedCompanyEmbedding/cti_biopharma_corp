bloodcancerfocused biotech isnt out of the woods yet but it looks like it will finally be allowed to continue an important clinical trial cory renauer tmfangapples jan   at pm image source getty images what happened shares of cti biopharma corp nasdaqctic had notched a  gain as of  am est today it appears the bloodcancerfocused biotech will finally be allowed to continue a pivotal trial with pacritinib ctic data by ycharts so what cti biopharma stock suffered a severe market beatdown last february when the food and drug administration fda slapped a partial hold on clinical studies with pacritinib under the hold investigators were barred from starting treatment with the experimental myelofibrosis drug and the development of one of the companys most important assets stalled the company has one commercialstage product in the european union eu but pixuvri for treatment of extremely difficulttotreat patients with an aggressive form of nonhodgkin lymphoma hasnt earned an fda approval in the first nine months of  cti biopharma recorded just  million in product sales which is hardly enough to cover its extensive research and development outlays now what adding a second product to its commercial lineup hopefully pacritinib for treatment of myelofibrosis is vital to achieving sustainable positive cash flows from the beginning of  through the end of september that year cti recorded a  million loss despite receiving  million from pacritinib development partner baxalta which is now a part of shire nasdaqshpg the company finished september with just  million in cash and cash equivalents which suggests another valuediluting share offering will be necessary in the near future just to keep operations humming along the companys market capitalization sank from around  million ahead of the hold to around  million at recent prices that seems awfully cheap for a company with one commercialstage drug albeit in the eu only plus pacritinib which is ready to begin a pivotal study and has a chance of receiving an expedited review if its application is accepted by the fda any more holdworthy side effects associated with pacritinib would be disastrous but this tiny biotech is worth keeping an eye on this year successful results from the greenlighted pivotal trial could make todays gains seem trivial in comparison cory renauer has no position in any stocks

of the date of this quarterly report on form q overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition development and commercialization of novel targeted therapies covering a spectrum of bloodrelated cancers that offer a unique benefit to patients and health care providers our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize either alone or with partners we are currently concentrating our efforts on treatments that target bloodrelated cancers where there is an unmet medical need in particular we are primarily focused on evaluating pacritinib for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis and the further development of pixuvri worldwide for which our partner les laboratoires servier and institut de recherches internationales servier or collectively servier has commercialization rights outside the united states or the us pixuvri pixuvri is a novel azaanthracenedione with unique structural and physiochemical properties in may  the european commission granted conditional marketing authorization in the european union or the eu for pixuvri as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive bcell nonhodgkin lymphoma or nhl pixuvri is the first approved treatment in the eu for patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive bcell nhl who have failed two or three prior lines of therapy as a part of the conditional marketing authorization we are required to conduct a postauthorization trial which we refer to as pix comparing pixuvri and rituximab with gemcitabine and rituximab in the setting of aggressive bcell nhl although we do not have and are not currently pursuing regulatory approval of pixuvri in the us we may reevaluate a possible submission strategy in the us based on the data generated from the pix study pursuant to our conditional marketing authorization in the eu and an extension granted in september  we are required to submit the requisite clinical study report for pix by december  in april  we entered into an amended and restated exclusive license and collaboration agreement or the restated agreement with servier under the restated agreement servier will have rights to pixuvri in all markets except in the us where we will retain the commercialization rights previously servier had rights to commercialize the drug globally except in austria denmark finland germany israel norway sweden turkey the united kingdom or the uk and the us servier will pay us  million and is obligated to purchase a certain amount of pixuvri drug product for an additional  million within  days of the restated agreement we are eligible to receive up to  million in additional sales and regulatory milestone payments as well as royalties on net product sales for additional information on our collaboration with servier please see the discussion in part i item  license agreements and milestone activities  servier pacritinib our lead development candidate pacritinib is an investigational oral kinase inhibitor with specificity for jak flt irak and csfr the jak family of enzymes is a central component in signal transduction pathways which are critical to normal blood cell growth and development as well as inflammatory cytokine expression and immune responses mutations in these kinases have been shown to be directly related to the development of a variety of bloodrelated cancers including myeloproliferative neoplasms leukemia and lymphoma in addition to myelofibrosis the kinase profile of pacritinib suggests its potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia or aml myelodysplastic syndrome or mds chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or cmml and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or cll due to its inhibition of cfms irak jak and flt we believe pacritinib has the potential to be delivered as a single agent or in combination therapy regimens pacritinib was evaluated in two phase  clinical trials known as the persist program for patients with myelofibrosis with one trial in a broad set of patients without limitations on platelet counts the persist trial and the other in patients with low platelet counts the persist trial in august  pacritinib was granted fast track designation by the food and drug administration or the fda for the treatment of intermediate and high risk myelofibrosis including but not limited to patients with diseaserelated thrombocytopenia low platelet counts patients experiencing treatmentemergent thrombocytopenia on other jak inhibitor therapy or patients who are intolerant of or whose symptoms are not well controlled suboptimally managed on other jak therapy in may  we announced the final results from persist our phase  trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pacritinib compared to bat best available therapy excluding jak inhibitors which included a broad range of currently utilized treatments in  patients with myelofibrosis regardless of the patients platelet counts the study included patients with severe or lifethreatening thrombocytopenia patients were randomized to receive  mg pacritinib once daily or bat excluding jak inhibitors the trial met its primary endpoint of spleen volume reduction svr  percent or greater from baseline to week  by magnetic resonance imaging mri or computerized tomography ct the most common treatmentemergent adverse events aes occurring in  percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within  weeks of any grade were gastrointestinal generally manageable diarrhea and nausea and anemia in february  clinical studies under the investigational new drug ind for pacritinib were subject to a full clinical hold issued by the fda a full clinical hold is a suspension of the clinical work requested under the ind application under the full clinical hold all patients currently on pacritinib were required to discontinue pacritinib immediately and no patients could be enrolled or start pacritinib as initial or crossover treatment in its written notification the fda cited the reasons for the full clinical hold were that it noted interim overall survival results from the persist phase  trial showing a detrimental effect on survival consistent with the results from persist in february  prior to the clinical hold we completed patient enrollment in the persist phase  clinical trial under the full clinical hold all patients participating in the persist clinical trial discontinued pacritinib treatment in august  we announced the topline results from persist our phase  trial of pacritinib for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than or equal to  per microliter three hundred eleven  patients were enrolled in the study which formed the basis for the safety analysis two hundred twentyone  patients had a chance to reach week  the primary analysis time point at the time the clinical hold was imposed and constituted the intenttotreat analysis population utilized for the evaluation of efficacy results demonstrated that the persist trial met one of the coprimary endpoints showing a statistically significant response rate in svr in patients with myelofibrosis treated with pacritinib compared to bat including the approved jak inhibitor ruxolitinib the coprimary endpoint of reduction of total symptom score tss was not achieved but trended toward improvement in tss there was no significant difference in overall survival across treatment arms censored at the time of clinical hold the most common treatmentemergent aes occurring in  percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within  weeks of any grade were gastrointestinal generally manageable diarrhea nausea and vomiting and hematologic anemia and thrombocytopenia and were generally less frequent for twicedaily bid versus oncedaily qd administration details of the trial were presented in a latebreaking oral session at the american society of hematology annual meeting in december  in january  the fda removed the full clinical hold following review of our complete response submission which included among other items final clinical study reports for both persist and  trials and a doseexploration clinical trial protocol that the fda requested at that time we announced that we intend to conduct a new trial pac that plans to enroll up to approximately  patients with primary myelofibrosis who have failed prior ruxolitinib therapy to evaluate the dose response relationship for safety and efficacy svr at  and  weeks of three dose regimens  mg qd  mg bid and  mg bid the  mg bid dose regimen was used in persist the company expects to initiate the trial in the second quarter of  the marketing authorization application or maa for pacritinib was submitted to the european medicines agency or ema in february  with an indication statement based on the persist trial data in its initial assessment report the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp determined that the current application is not approvable at this point in the review cycle because of major objections in the areas of efficacy safety hematological and cardiovascular toxicity and the overall riskbenefit profile of pacritinib subsequent to the filing of the maa data from the second phase  trial of pacritinib persist were reported these data suggest that pacritinib may show clinical benefit in patients who have failed or are intolerant to ruxolitinib therapy a population for which there is no approved therapy following discussions with the ema about how persist data might address the major objections and how to integrate the data into the current application we have decided to withdraw the maa we are preparing a new maa that seeks to address the major objections by including data from persist that will focus on patients with baseline platelet counts less than or equal to  per microliter including patients with prior exposure to jak inhibitor therapy we plan to submit this application midyear  other pipeline candidates our earlier stage product candidate tosedostat is a novel oral oncedaily aminopeptidase inhibitor that has demonstrated significant responses in patients with aml it is currently being evaluated in several phase  cooperative groupsponsored trials and investigatorsponsored trials these trials are evaluating tosedostat in combination with hypomethylating agents in aml and mds which are cancers of the blood and bone marrow we anticipate data from these signalfinding trials may be used to determine an appropriate design for a phase  trial management and board of directors in february  we announced the appointment of adam craig md phd as

revenues are generated from a combination of pixuvri sales and collaboration and license agreements collaboration revenues reflect the earned amount of upfront payments and milestone payments under our product collaborations total revenues were  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively our loss from operations for the three months ended march   was  million compared to income from operations of  million for the three months ended march   our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and as a result you should not rely on them as being indicative of our future performance as of march   cash and cash equivalents were  million results of operations product sales net we sell pixuvri primarily through a limited number of wholesale distributors servier is responsible for distribution of pixuvri in the respective countries in its territory we generally record product sales upon receipt of the product by the health care provider or distributor at which time title and risk of loss pass product sales net include royalty revenue as well as a provision for distributor discounts estimated governmentmandated discounts and rebates trade discounts and estimated product returns product sales net from pixuvri were  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively and included royalty revenue of  million for the three months ended march   no royalty revenue was recorded during the three months ended march   the decrease in product sales net of  million for the three months ended march   from the respective period in  was primarily related to pricing and volume variances between the periods presented as well as the decline in average exchange rate of the euro for our eurodenominated sales and the average exchange rate of the british pound for our pounddenominated sales the provision for product returns relates to a limited right of return or replacement that we offer to certain customers distributor discounts returns and rebates were  million during the three months ended march   while no material amount was recorded for the same period in  during the periods presented there were no other material payments and credits applied towards provision for discounts rebates and other for current or prior period sales gross sales is defined as our contracted reimbursement price in each country gross sales from pixuvri were  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively any expansion of our commercial operations in the eu including with regard to sales of pixuvri may increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates future revenues if any are dependent on market acceptance of pixuvri the reimbursement decisions made by governmental authorities in each country where pixuvri is available for sale and other factors license and contract revenues three months ended march    baxalta milestone and license revenue     development services revenue   total baxalta revenue   servier milestone and license revenue   development services revenue   total servier revenue   total license and contract revenue     baxalta in october  we resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the termination of the pacritinib license agreement with baxalta incorporated and its affiliates or baxalta which is now part of shire plc as such we will no longer be eligible to receive cost sharing or milestone payments for pacritinibs development from baxalta during the three months ended march   we recorded milestone revenue of  million we received the cash advance for these milestone payments in the second quarter of  it was accounted for as longterm debt until the achievement of the associated milestones in the first quarter of  no such milestone payments were received during the three months ended march   due to the termination of the pacritinib license agreement as discussed above during the three months ended march   we recorded  million of development services revenue of which  million was related to the reimbursable development costs from baxalta under the terms of the pacritinib license agreement and  million was related to the upfront payment we received in connection with the execution of the pacritinib license agreement in  no such revenue was recorded during the same period in  due to the termination of the pacritinib license agreement as discussed above for additional information relating to the pacritinib license agreement see part i item  license agreements and milestone activities  baxalta servier in february  we entered into an agreement with one of serviers affiliates whereby we are to conduct a pharmacokinetic substudy on behalf of servier in conjunction with our ongoing clinical trial pix in relation to this study we recorded  and  million of expense reimbursements as development services revenue during the three months ended march   and  respectively we recognized  of revenue for the three months ended march   and  respectively relating to development services allocated from the upfront payment we received in connection with the agreement in place with servier the remaining deferred revenue balance was  million as of both march   and december   in addition the deferred revenue balance as of march   included a  million prepayment related to the pharmacokinetic substudy there was no such prepayment as of december   for additional information on our collaboration with servier see part i item  license agreements and milestone activities  servier operating costs and expenses cost of product sold cost of product sold is related to sales of pixuvri cost of product sold for the three months ended march   and  was  million and  million respectively the decrease in cost of product sold was primarily related to a decline in quantity of inventory sold between periods in addition to a decline in the euro between periods this was partially offset by an increase in the per unit cost of product sold related to the product mix of the reducedcost inventory we began capitalizing costs related to the production of pixuvri in february  upon receiving a positive opinion for conditional marketing authorization by the emas chmp while we tracked the quantities of individual pixuvri product lots we did not track manufacturing costs prior to capitalization and therefore the manufacturing cost of pixuvri produced prior to capitalization is not reasonably determinable we expect approximately half of this reducedcost inventory will be available for us to use commercially and to fulfill expected demand under the restated agreement with servier accordingly we have reserved  million of existing inventory expected to be unsalable as of both march   and december   the timing of the sales of such reducedcost inventory and its impact on gross margin is dependent on the level of pixuvri sales as well as our ability to utilize this inventory prior to its expiration datewe expect that our cost of product sold as a percentage of product sales may increase in future periods as pixuvri product manufactured and expensed prior to capitalization is sold however such future cost trend will ultimately depend on several factors in the near term including but not limited to the consumption rate and availability of reduced cost inventory the effect of expiring inventory and applicable manufacturing pricing structures which will depend in part on the particular drug substance manufacturers we select research and development expenses our research and development expenses for compounds under development and preclinical development were as follows in thousands three months ended march    compounds pixuvri     pacritinib   opaxio   tosedostat   operating expenses   research and preclinical development   total research and development expenses     costs for our compounds include external direct expenses such as principal investigator fees charges from contract research organizations or cros and contract manufacturing fees incurred for preclinical clinical manufacturing and regulatory activities associated with preparing the compounds for submissions of ndas or similar regulatory filings to the fda the ema or other regulatory agencies outside the us and europe as well as upfront license fees for acquired technology subsequent to receiving a positive opinion for conditional approval of pixuvri in the eu from the emas chmp costs associated with commercial batch production quality control stability testing and certain other manufacturing costs of pixuvri were capitalized as inventory operating expenses include our personnel and an allocation of occupancy depreciation and amortization expenses associated with developing these compounds research and preclinical development costs primarily include costs associated with external laboratory services associated with the compound under development by aequus biopharma inc we are not able to capture the total cost of each compound because we do not allocate operating expenses to all of our compounds external direct costs incurred by us as of march   were  million for pixuvri excluding costs prior to our  merger with novuspharma spa formerly a public pharmaceutical company located in italy  million for pacritinib excluding costs for pacritinib prior to our acquisition of certain assets from sbio in may  and  million of inprocess research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of certain assets from sbio  million for opaxio and  million for tosedostat excluding costs for tosedostat prior to our codevelopment and license agreement with chroma therapeutics limited or chroma in  and  million of inprocess research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of certain assets from chroma research and development expenses decreased to  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the same period in  the decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in pacritinib development costs as a result of the full clinical hold a decrease in operating expenses primarily attributed to personnel costs associated with a reduction in average headcount between periods and a reduction in pix comparator drug purchases between periods regulatory agencies including the fda and ema regulate many aspects of a product candidates life cycle including research and development and preclinical and clinical testing we will
