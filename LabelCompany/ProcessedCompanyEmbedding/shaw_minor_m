shaw busts out at plate for river cats  milbcom news now reading top headlines filter search by january february march april may june july august september october november december              go shaw busts out at plate for river cats giants no  prospect goes yard twice on fourhit night chris shaw has  extrabase hits in  games since his promotion to triplea ben sandstrommilbcom by michael leboff  milbcom  june    pm et baseball is undergoing a flyball revolution and chris shaw is more than happy to be along for the ride  san franciscos no  prospect set a career high with four hits including two homers driving in four and scoring three times in triplea sacramentos  win over el paso on thursday  the past two weeks or so i feel like ive put a lot of good swings on the ball shaw said and the balls that i have put in play ive been barreling and putting it in the air which is what im trying to do  barrel the ball and put it to center field after that whatever happens happens gameday box score the  firstround pick has noticed that the philosophy around hitting is about trying to put balls in the air  the way ive always hit has fallen into that kind of mindset shaw said maybe i wouldnt categorize myself as a flyball type of hitter before this year but for me  and this goes for any player  your best swing shouldnt be a hard ground ball up the middle or a hard liner up the middle it should be something with backspin thats going to carry into the gaps the massachusetts native realizes that a focus on elevating the ball also has helped improve his plate discipline  youre not going to be able to put a ball in the air in center field on a pitch you cant drive he said so this approach puts you in the mindset of im going to get a pitch in this atbat that i can put in the air with some authority behind it shaw put the river cats on the board in the second inning when he turned on a  fastball from starter tyrell jenkins and put it over the centerfield fence  i went in looking to hit something hard and elevate something the boston college product said the first pitch was a fastball inside kind of a brushback pitch so i figured he was trying to get me off the plate a little bit i kind of figured he was looking to go outside corner or something like that i was able to get a twoseamer that caught the middle of the plate and i got a good swing on it video sacramentos shaw hits second homer in the third shaw jumped on the first pitch from jenkins and drove a threerun blast to leftcenter  the first pitch was in the exact same spot as the one i hit in my first atbat so i took the same swing on it shaw said el paso is a great ballpark for hitters theres no question about that its the type of place that if you barrel a ball in the air youll get rewarded a little more than you would elsewhere shaw completed the first fourhit game of his career with singles to right in the fifth and seventh  since being promoted to triplea on may  shaw sports a  slash line with six homers and  rbis in  games for doublea richmond the foot pounder batted 9 with six homers and  rbis  shaw has drawn four walks in  games with the river cats he had  with the flying squirrels i know im not walking nearly as much as i normally do and honestly after the game ill look at that and kind of figure out why that is but a lot of it goes back to the fact that guys are around the zone a lot more shaw explained im not going up there with the intention to walk im looking to drive something if im getting it im going to put a good swing on it i definitely have noticed that my onbase percentage isnt where it normally is but i cant put my finger on it other than guys throw a lot more strikes up here even with his firstever fourhit day behind him shaw is happy to go back to the drawing board to grow his game as he nears the major leagues  milb include every day im learning something new he said i dont really look at the numbers as much as i look at the ways i can improve as an overall hitter just based off the way guys pitch up here because its a lot different than doublea you could argue that at doublea guys may have more raw stuff and guys might have more velocity but everyone up here knows how to pitch and can throw any pitch in any count for a strike im learning a lot about myself and how to maximize my skills against guys who know how to execute a gameplan video el pasos villanueva goes deep again in his second triplea game catcher matt winn put the river cats ahead with a threerun blast in the ninth the yearold contributed two doubles a walk and four rbis christian villanueva went deep twice and drove in three for el paso  michael leboff is a contributor to milbcom this story was not subject to the approval of the national association of

and rise through the minors  knbram   listen live now knbr  knbr  murph  mac  am   am minor league podcast giants prospect chris shaw on his move to left field and rise through the minorscody pasby at the beginning of the  season only the most die hard san francisco giants fans were familiar with the name chris shaw now after making it to aaa sacramento in just under two seasons shaw is one of the most discussed prospects in the giants farm system just one season removed from hitting  bombs in  games shaw is hitting 9 with an  ops this season and nine of his  home runs have come since his promotion to the river cats despite the hype about his power shaw doesn’t view himself as a classic slugger “personally i don’t necessarily think of myself as a power over hits guy” shaw said on the latest edition of the knbr minor league podcast “i’ve always thought that if i’m hitting consistently well power is just gonna come as a byproduct of good at bats… i like to swing the bat… if i need to take a walk i’ll take a walk but i’m going up there with the intention of getting something to hit so if i get it i’m pulling the trigger” having an aggressive middle of the order power threat would be great news for a giants team that ranks last in all of baseball in home runs and slugging percentage in addition the fact that he’s made the transition back to the outfield where he played in college makes his success even more exciting for a team in desperate need of young outfield talent “i think it’s a little different playing the outfield in pro ball versus in college” shaw said of becoming an everyday left fielder after starting his pro career at st base “we pretty much pitch the same to most guys in college so you kinda get an idea of where if a guy’s gonna be putting the ball in the outfield where it’s gonna be… here it’s a little different you gotta read swings you gotta adjust on the fly depending on the count outs the way the wind’s playing… but having played in college i definitely feel comfortable out there” for more from chris shaw and to hear his thoughts on hitting in the pitcherfriendly confines of att park one day check out this week’s edition of the knbr
