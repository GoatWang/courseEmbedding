commitment to transparency who was dr joseph jacobs by ted ryan  may   share jacobs pharmacy later renamed jacobs drug store at the corner of peachtree and marietta streets in downtown atlanta circa  photo credit   in my  years in the cocacola archives i must have said the line “cocacola was first served on may   at jacobs’ pharmacy” thousands of times as i have discussed the history of the drink  with the constant repetition jacobs’s pharmacy had become a “thing” rather than a place or store run by a family this year for our th birthday i wanted to go a little deeper and introduce you to dr joseph jacobs the man who founded jacobs’ pharmacy dr joseph jacobs credit atlanta history center a native of jefferson ga jacobs studied under dr crawford w long the jefferson doctor who discovered the use of ether as an anesthetic long was instrumental in ensuring jacobs acceptance to the university of georgia after graduation jacobs continued his education at the philadelphia college of pharmacy and science before returning to athens ga to open the athens pharmaceutical company the growth of atlanta lured jacobs to the city and he moved there in january  and purchased taylor pharmacy at five points in downtown atlanta   in  dr jacobs wrote an article for drug topics an industry magazine for the pharmacy trade called “how i won and lost an interest in cocacola” in this article jacobs described the soda fountain in his building “on the righthand side of the entrance was a soda fountain conducted by willis venable who was assisted by his brother john venable and his son edward venable now one of the leading restaurant keepers in atlanta the fountain enjoyed a wonderful reputation and did a large business it averaged fully  a day from the various drinks” as was the custom of the day the fountains were often set up on space that was rented from the pharmacy owners this is the case with venable and jacobs its important to keep in mind what pharmacies were like in  they were more like general stores that also dispensed medicine open to men and woman pharmacies were often gathering spaces for people to get the news of the day pick up their items and enjoy a moment at the fountain jacobs’ pharmacy was one of the leading pharmacies in atlanta part of the reason for its popularity was dr jacobs’ innovative business practices jacobs was one of the first atlanta retailers to discount his goods in an interesting story the smallest currency used in atlanta after the civil war was the nickel jacobs saw an opportunity and purchased  worth of pennies from the mint in washington and began to discount items from  to  cents so he could provide change the discounts attracted customers but angered competitors to the point that he became the target of threats and lawsuits jacobs stuck to his strategy and as the anger simmered the penny had come to stay in atlanta as jacobs’ wrote in his  article he was once a coowner of the cocacola company for a short time willis venable had purchased a share of ownership from dr john pemberton the inventor of cocacola with that purchase pemberton retained a share but also received a royalty per gallon from venable venable became strapped for cash because he was building a home in atlanta’s west end to raise funds venable sold his portion of the formula to jacobs in return for a cash advance  at this point asa candler enters the story jacobs and candler were well acquainted as two of atlanta’s leading pharmacists asa even arranged for his son charles howard candler to work in jacobs’ pharmacy so he could learn the trade candler expressed an interest in getting out of the pharmacy business and jacobs has told him he knew little of cocacola and wished to dispose of his interest in the product the two struck a deal where candler gave jacobs an interest in a glass factory in exchange for his share of cocacola candler in turn purchased pemberton’s portion and soon took total control of the company jacobs drug store at the junction of peachtree street and roswell road in the heart of buckhead circa   ater disposing of my cocacola stock to mr candler i never owned any more of it which evidences my poor judgement jacobs wrote but that does not due full justice to his success as a business leader from his single store at five points jacobs continued to expand his business and became the leading drug store owner in the city at the time of his death in september  jacobs owned eight stores in atlanta his son sinclair jacobs also a pharmacist continued to grow the chain until there were  stores in the south sinclair sold the chain to revco drugs after world war ii joseph jacobs was a member of the temple and well respected in the community his son sinclair was president of the temple during the s the family owned a acre estate on roswell road north of buckhead sinclair died in  and was survived by his son tory who moved to miami until his death in  while the original jacobs’ pharmacy location at five points is long gone you can still get a sense of the family by visiting historic oakland cemetery in atlanta to see the jacobs’ mausoleum one of the first and finest in the city so the next time you read or hear the phrase “cocacola was first served on may th at jacobs’ pharmacy” i hope you have a fuller sense of the man ted ryan is director of heritage

guthrie who lived in queens ny wrote a song about his terrible landlord fred trump i heard that from arlo at an interview  “those who cannot remember history are condemned to repeat it” santayna“history repeats itself” a proverb“history is bunk” henry ford“just the facts ma’am just the facts” joe fridaywe know that the worst economic crashes in the last hundred and fifty years happened during republican administrations of hoover and george w bush we know that we have a boombust economy so i was curious to look back and read who was in charge during other busts  my sources were a  world almanac and the peoples chronology  by james trager republican pres usgrant… wall street “black friday” ruins small investors and gold speculation destroys half of the banks and businesses in new york…”congressional investigating committee states that the country is becoming filled with gigantic corporations commanding great influence and power in state legislatures and the nation lincoln warned the same during his time in office september another “black friday” causes  businesses to fail millions of workers depend on soup kitchens tens of thousands close to starvation  businesses fail by republican pres rutherford b hayes……economist henry george states that while the country is getting richer and richer most americans are getting poorer and poorerrepublican pres benjamin harrison……wall street panic  economic depression starts leading to market collapse  banks close  businesses fail… it lasts  yearsrepublican pres teddy roosevelt……wall street panic… economic crisis …banks close as depression continuesrepublican preswarren harding…… businesses fail  million out of work republican pres calvin coolidge…… business improves until …so far the only good economy under a republicanrepublican pres herbert hoover…… depression starts banks close unemployment increases and it gets worse year by year  million by the time dem pres fdr comes into office and comes to the aid of the working class with safeguards that have served the american people for decades safeguards republicans would like to do away with for decadesrepublican pres ddeisenhower……economic recession great unemployment  of americans below the poverty linedemocratic pres lyndon johnson……us economy and mergers boom and continue until  when rep pres nixon begins various bad economic policiesrepublican pres richard m nixon… reckless savingsloan deals cost tax payers  billion …continental illinois bank avoids failure with a  billion federal loan guarantee biggest run on bank since  threatens a chain reaction of bank closings public confidence in banks declines collapse of oil prices affects texas and oklahoma banks and savings institutions ohio bank fails causing run on other banks  thrifts are closed in panic federal regulators take over a beverly hills savingsloan due to deregulation signed by reagan and budget cuts that reduced regulators …us debt tops  trillion up i trillion since  weakening dollar national debt triples by  under reagan high trade deficit and budget deficit  sl losses  billionrepublican pres george hwbush… bails out sls at tax payers expense commercial banks are jeopardized dow jones industrials drops  in october  “read my lips no new taxes”  billion budget deficit supply side economics of reagan years has piled up huge debt while creating a false boom country goes into recession bush lost reelection “it’s the economystupid”democratic pres bill clinton…reduces national debt by  billion and creates a boom economyrepublican pres georg w bush… briefly increases debt and causes worst crash since democratic pres barak h obama saves the economy from disasterit seems that republicans are bad for business and democrats are good for business and workers conservativescons versus progressivespros pros are better than cons for a healthy economyi don’t remember who said” i can’t wait for the democrats to get into office so that i can live like a republican again”  even trump has said that the economy is better under democrats both bush presidents were late responding to hurricanes no fema head as of june  where do you live  the first action by the con controlled congress was to try to get rid of the congressional ethics office leading to questionable confirmations ethics gets lost in laissez faire    laissez faire unregulated business is bound to have the same dangers as a city without cops…like a wild west movie where the town’s rich guy owns most of the town the sheriff and the judge allowing for greater corruption fraud dangerous products various harms to workers and consumers things don’t go better with koch there are no safety nets in the con circus just a bunch of clowns who keep botching up the works if the public has a low opinion of the politics of inaction and politicians one can clearly point to the republican party since reagan the koch brothers had a meeting with judges from all over the us was gorsuch there  newt gingrich when he was speaker of the house handed out a list of  or more words to use to demean and ridicule liberals what are the words we can use to expose and devalue cons obstructionists heartless constipoidal rigid discriminatory know nothings………………………if a man accuses all others of lying and keeps accusing others of lying shouldn’t we be pretty clear on who is the liar “if you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens you can never regain their respect or esteem it is true that you may fool some of the people some of the time you can even fool

found a wonderful affirmation  that can be useful from time to time                                    i choose a new lifei forgive myself for all mistakes and confusions of the past i wipe the slate

in conflict with ourselves even before we come in contact with others so how can there be peace on earthi have long believed that life is resolving a series of ambivalencein the film the colonel and me with danny kaye and curt jurgens two very different people meet in times of trouble the kaye character always solves problems by saying  well there are two possibilitieseither things will improve or they wontif things improve why worryif things dont improve there are two possibilitieseither we can fix it or we cantif we fix it why worry if we cant fix it well  there are two possibilitiesand so
