application ser no  filed feb   entitled “system and method for monitoring service levels of an application service provider” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entiretytechnical field the present application generally relates to the field of monitoring information over a network more specifically the present application relates to systems and methods for monitoring service provider performance in network based service hosting environments background network based service hosting is a business model in which one company offers software hosting services eg application hosting services to other companies so that those companies no longer have to support software and hardware used to perform business related operations in such a business relationship the service to be provided and the quality of service to be performed are defined in a contractual document called a service level agreement “sla” businesses that offers such services are typically referred to as service providers in traditional service provider business relationships the service providers compensation is based on flat fee arrangements service provider customers currently measure their provider in terns of system uptime bandwidth scalability security and problem resolution further it is anticipated that in the future service provider customers will measure their providers in terms of for example cost savings cycle time reduction customer retention and supply chain efficiency in order for a service provider to convince customers or potential customers that it has satisfied or can satisfy specified service tasks and levels of service quality the service provider is often asked to provide evidence that the services provided have been consistent with the sla without credible evidence enforcement of the sla becomes difficult and thus customers are reluctant to stay in such business relationships or to enter into such business relationships a need therefore exists for methods and systems that monitor service provider performance and facilitate a translation of such performance to customer expectations summary the present application provides methods and systems for monitoring service provider performance in a computer processing environment according to one aspect of the disclosure a method for monitoring service provider performance is disclosed the method includes defining performance criteria and deploying at least one data collection agent each deployed data collection agent is executed to monitor and collect operation data and the operation data from each of the data collection agents is received and aggregated the method further includes determining a level of service based on the performance criteria and the aggregated operation data a system for monitoring service provider performance is also disclosed the system includes a means for defining performance criteria and a means for collecting data each deployed data collection agent is executed to monitor and collect operation data and the operation data fromeach of the data collection agents is received and aggregated the method further includes determining a level of service based on the performance criteria and the aggregated operation data computerreadable storage media are also disclosed which include processing instructions for implementing certain disclosed methods the disclosed systems and methods enable managing metering and reporting service levels of a service provider the objects features and advantages of the proposed method and system are readily apparent

the disclosure fig  is a block diagram illustrating components one embodiment of the data director of fig  fig  is a functional block diagram of a process for monitoring service provider performance including service level management and service metering methodologies in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure fig  is an exemplary flow diagram of a service metering methodology for monitoring the performance of a service provider in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosed method and fig  is an exemplary menu hierarchy of one embodiment of a service level management applicationdetailed description fig  is an exemplary service provider system that includes service level management service metering and billing applications that can be interactively used to set up a service provider relationship with customers monitor the achievements of the service provider and the billing of customers based on the achievements met by the service provider the service provider system according to the present disclosure can be utilized for any type of network based service provider examples of such include internet service providers isps application service providers asps and management service providers msps the relationship between the service provider and the customer is defined by an agreement known as a service level agreement sla an sla is a contract between a service provider and a customer that outlines the service or services to be provided and the level at which such service is to be provided that is the sla defines the rights and responsibilities of the service provider and the customer regarding the service to be provided typically in the service provider system according to the present disclosure the service provider agrees to provide certain specified levels of service and the customer agrees to compensate the service provider based on the level of service actually provided within or associated with an sla is a list of one or more conditions or objectives known as service level objectives slos  that define the level of service the service provider agrees to provide to the customer examples of such objectives include service provider system availability and accessibility and metrics associated with the performance of the services to be performed the slo are generally based on the level of service desired or required by the customer and the levels of service that the service provider is able or willing to provide it should be noted that the slos may vary depending upon the service being provided and possible the terms of the sla referring now to fig  the methods and systems disclosed herein employ methodologies for service level management and service metering which can be used to monitor the performance of service providers in relation to a service level agreement a service level agreement sla is a contract between a clienttenant and a service provider that outlines the service to be provided and the quality of the service to be provided by the provider the methods and systems described herein can be utilized for any type of network based service provider examples of such include internet service providers isps application service providers asps and management service providers msps early in the service provider—customer relationship the service provider and the customer typically determine the service level objectives  service level objectives slo are a list of operation conditions that define the quality of services to be provided such as for example the availability accessibility and performance of the services to be performed the slo are generally based on the level of service desired or required by the customer and the levels of service that the service provider is able or willing to provide the slo form the basis for a sla between the service provider and the customer  the sla defines the rights and responsibilities of the service provider and the customer regarding the service to be provided typically the service provider is obligated to provide certain specified levels of service and the customer is obligated to pay the service provider based on the level of service actually provided in order to objectively evaluate the level of service provided by the service provider the service provider and customer define a set of quantifiable performance criteria in accordance with the slo and sla  typically the performance criteria is designed to ensure that the customer is provided with a level of service above or below a certain minimum threshold for example the customer may request service within a particular maximum response time or the customer may request that an application be accessible for a minimum amount of time per day further the performance criteria should be designed to include events or conditions that can be documented or otherwise verified so that the customer and service provider can be satisfied with the service provider  customer relationship once the service levels and performance criteria have been defined a service monitoring procedure is implemented  and the service is monitored accordingly  the service is monitored throughout the term of the sla and analyzed in view of the performance criteria  once the actual level of service is determined the service provider may be renumerated based on the value of the service as defined in the sla  referring now to fig  a flow diagram of the service level management methodology in accordance with the present disclosure the service level management methodology which can be implemented by a software based service level manager defines the performance criteria  from the sla the service level management application performs the functions of blocks  resulting in defined performance criteria the defined performance criteria may relate to any number of a variety of metrics that may measure performance in one embodiment the performance criteria may relate for example to criteria associated with a specific group of users a particular business function or a specific application the service metering software application performs the functions of blocks  illustrated in fig  the service metering software application includes one or more data collection agents that are deployed throughout the system to be monitored  each data collection agent is configured to monitor the operation of at least a portion the system based on the performance criteria and collect operation data for use in evaluating the system performance  throughout the term of the sla each data collection agent periodically transmits the collected operation data to a data director  discussed in greater detail with reference to fig  which receives and aggregates the collected operation data  the service metering software application analyzes the performance of the service by applying the performance criteria to the aggregated operation data  and a value of the service is determined  the application of the performance criteria to the aggregated operation data may be accomplished in any of a number of ways depending on the nature of the aggregated operation data obtained for example if the aggregated operation data represents an average of operating values it may be compared to a minimum acceptable average defined by the performance criteria in another example if the aggregated operation data represents the presence or absence of an unacceptable operating condition the aggregated operation data may be tested in accordance with the performance criteria the value of the service may be reported to the service provider andor the customer in a number of ways for example the service provider may receive the value of the service and may incorporate the value into a billing statement provided to the customer alternatively the value of the service the performance criteria andor the aggregated operation data may be incorporated into a hardcopy report that may be provided to both the service provider and the customer operating environment referring now to fig  a block diagram of an exemplary service provider system for monitoring service provider performance is provided generally the system includes a data repository  a service level management application  and a service metering application  that communicate through an application integration bus  the service level management application  stores andor retrieves data defining the service level agreement service level objectives and performance criteria to andor from the data repository  the application integration bus  of the system  is capable of storing information to and retrieving information from a variety of disparate sources including for example the data repository  and billing application  the application integration bus  is an infrastructure that facilitates communication between different computer programs in a consistent and reliable manner an example of a suitable application integration bus is the ca common services application formerly known as jasmineii manufactured by computer associates international inc islandia ny the service metering application  includes one or more data collection agents  that monitor the metrics associated with the performance criteria and collect system operation data each data collection agent  may utilize different technology to collect data according to predetermined metrics for example a data collection agent  may monitor cpu usage of a workstation while another data collection agent  may monitor an applications failure rate data collected by one agent can be used for one or many metrics the amount of operation data collected by the data collection agents  is scalable based on the number of data collection agents  associated with the system data collection agents  may be deployed when the system is originally configured or may be added or removed dynamically during operation of the system each data collection agent  of the service metering application  may be configured to monitor a specific component or group of components in the service provider architecture examples of the categories of components that may be monitored include for example applications platforms operational components andor network components there may be subcategories of components for which metrics are monitored that are different from or more detailed than the basic category for example there may be several subcategories in the applications category such as an email subpackage an erp subpackage or an accounting package to name a few the definition of each category or subcategory enables the service metering application  to monitor application specific metrics which may only be available from a particular type of application the operation data collected by the one or more data collection agents  is forwarded to a data director  the data director  receives the operation data from the data collection agents  performs an initial level of data aggregation and generates slo for particular metrics in addition to aggregating the operation data data director  may also redirect raw or consolidated dataevents to other components such as billing application  andor service level management application  the redirected data may pass through the application integration bus  or may be transmitted to a third party integrator  through for example a publish and subscribe model interface the data director  further provides management and configuration capability to data collection agents  within the package and provides feedback to a management system regarding the status of components the illustrated system includes a single data director  but alternative embodiments may include more than one data director  depending on the number of data collection agents  and the workload the illustrated system further shows that the data director  has its own temporary database  for storing small interval aggregated data the service metering application  can operate in a standalone mode for limited datagathering for a service provider or it can work in an integrated data feed mode for other products such as billing application  and service level management application  the service metering application  may include an interface to pull data from the data director  for batch processing or in a register callback mode to push data out to a requester for real time events for billing application  usage data or billable data may be available from different sources in one embodiment the output is in xml to provide a flexible data exchange format for service level management application  initial aggregated operation data may be available for to evaluate the sla certain slo violation events may also be available in the illustrated embodiment the service metering application  is well suited for an asp aggregator because data can be transferred from multiple asps to the aggregator in xml format through the application integration bus  the service metering application  also includes technology to help a client verify the quality of service provided by a service provider such as for example user response time and system accessibility the service metering application  may also provide sample sla templates using the predefined slos from a base package the data collector master  “dc master” is a system component that is responsible for monitoring requests from the data collectors  to the data director  the dc master  reports heartbeat information to the data director  and can start stop or reset any data collector  based on commands from a configuration manager  of the data director  every data collector  is monitored by a dc master  although a single dc master  is illustrated a system may include more than one dc master  to accommodate a higherworkload referring now to fig  there is illustrated a more detailed view of the data director  in the illustrated embodiment data director  includes http server  cgi script  and configuration manager  http server  may be conventional web server and it facilitates communication with data collection agents  andor third party integrator  configuration manager  is responsible for handling requests from service level management application  and billing application  received via the application interface bus  configuration manager is further responsible for managing the aggregation of operation data and the transfer of raw and aggregated operation data to the data repository  the aggregation and transfer of operation data is actually performed by cgi script  at the direction of configuration manager  the cgi script  further handles data requests to and from the service metering application  and maintains the integrity of the data repository  after every interval for example deleting outdated data external access to data repository  is also managed by configuration manager  an authorized party such as third party integrator  may request access to the data repository via configuration manager  such access may be provided via an http or other communication means and may be subject to certain security procedures such as providing a login id and password service level management overview the service level management application  is designed for a service provider environment and enables management of business objectives and transactions not just of system resources it also provides rolebased views to interface with the application to perform these business activities the service level management application  utilizes and maintains business objects such as for example contracts between a customer and a service provider the application allows an asp administrator for example to create customized sla offering packages handle the contract and offering package changes define new users and user groups and remove a user from the system among other things the described service level management application is designed to apply to a variety of aspects of a service providers business model and it offers a number of features from a users point of view for example a user can define a combination of service level goals or may simply select from a predefined list another exemplary feature of the service level management application is that it supports negotiation of the sla if the service provider desires the user can have the freedom to define multiple aspects of the sla including for example service level goals legal terms fees and operation exceptions yet another feature is that a user can sign up multiple contracts for different user groupings or business functions from a administrators point of view the application supports management of users and user groups sla contract administration and management is also supported enabling aservice ′  provider to offer many different contract templates the service level management application further supports branding enabling a service provider to brand all the sla gui and reports with a customers identity the service level management application handles a variety of slo syntax and logic in addition the application components are selfmanaged with detailed logging and “progress pointers” built in in case of system failure the system can recover and continue the data processing without losing any data the described service level management application is designed to fulfill the need for a service provider to provide a precise sla offering to its customers the system supports the endtoend operation of this business offering the application interfaces with a servicemetering software application to gather usage performance and operation information preserve objective service level data and process the slos based on the contract the application also interfaces with the customer of the system to present a precise sla statement through reports the application is scalable from a very small service provider setup to an extremely large service provider operation in one embodiment such scalability is achieved using a distributed and parallel processing design to allow multiple components to work together to complete the data processing rolebased sla processing a number of different configurations are possible based on the role of the user the service level management application processes the related information and presents the sla reports the application supports a number of business relationships between a service provider and for example an enduser and enterprise organization another service provider an asp aggregator an ispnsp an isv or a system vendor distributed processing engine the service level management application can be deployed to a service provider of any size typically the application will be deployed to a single machine which accesses the service metering database locally or remotely in a larger environment itis possible thata single computer will not have enough throughput to complete schedule tasks the application enables partitioning of the contract data and assigning some data to a distributed sla engine for processing a single contract and service definition database may serve this distributed environment so the system does not need to perform difficult synchronization functions among multiple databases the sla engine is designed to process the user subscribed slos in near realtime fashion shortly after an slo violation occurs the application generates an event further the transactions and processes performed by the sla system may be audited and archived in the sla components the transactions and processing logic is logged in persistent storage before they are processed then the process will “sign off” each completed task this provides the system with a “pointer” of what needs to be processed next this enables the system be able to recover from a failure without losing or redundantly processing important information provisioning in some cases it may be necessary to periodically update the sla sla provisioning can be achieved easily by changing data in the service definition and subscription data tables which contain definitions of metrics to be monitored and associated time frames the provisioned changes will take effect immediately following the changes in another words the sla provisioning can be achieved in a realtime fashion in some cases since the sla correlates to a contract it might be better to implement the provisioning operations at the expiration point of the previous contract rather than replace the expired contract with the new contract this situation might also apply to the slometric calculation threshold values and service monitoring the service level management application  is able to fulfill both of these cases contract break points certain changes such as for example changes in the subscription contents service definition contract detail or period may effect an sla report or contract before a contract period expires to accommodate such changes the service level management application can register a proper “break point” in the calendar that marks the termination of the existing slacontract and starting of the new one when the application generates the reports or reviews the contract service level based on the break point the application may generate two insistences of outcomes one for the detail before the change and one for the detail after the change if necessary both outcomes may be prorated based on the time to reflect the true values of the monitored result time zones the service level management application handles multiple time zones driven by an sla contract thereby supporting all users in a consistent way regardless of geography since a service provider often provides services on a global network its service may span several geographic locations and operational models it is possible that a service provider will have a user using the service from any country in the world there are many possible approaches to handle time zone issues based on a users geographic location one embodiment of the service level management application synchronizes of the interval timestamps to gmt time then based on the service provider “base” users time zone the service provider performs all the necessary clock calculations for example assume a user of a service provider signs up a main location in new york assume farther that there is a single contract with an slo that only requires monitoring between  am and  pm est when this user travels to the west coast and accesses the service provider the service provider may still base performance on the east coast time zone to operate its logic regardless of whether the user is actually using the service in a different time zone operation outage exclusion the service level management application handles scheduled operation outages such as on weekends and holidays if an outage happens during those excluded periods the “availability” calculation mayexclude those periods in the calculation formula support of compound slo syntax in most cases an slo might look like “for app a metric m will not operator than threshold based on interval” in some cases the statement above will simply serve as a “first step” of the slo violation with another operation dependent upon this state for example a violation may be defined as “for app a metric m will not operator than threshold based on interval” and “when this situation happens t times in interval” another example of an slo violation definition is “for app a metric mi will not operator than threshold based on interval“and ” for app a metric m will not operator than threshold based on interval” the sla engine is able to handle both cases further the engine is able to handle any practical number of layers of thresholds and interval checking flexible offering packaging the service level management application provides a service provider administrator the ability to build customized slo offering packages by grouping metrics and assigning slo thresholds and values the application further enables an asp to create bundles and pricing schemes to fit the service providers business goals in an extreme case the service provider can even offer a “free form” slo packages that gives the service provider user full flexibility for negotiation webbased guis separate guis are available for different users of this system depending on their roles fig  is a menu hierarchy that illustrates an example of the actions that may be taken and the roles that may be defined within the service level management application reporting the disclosed method and system support webbased sla reporting to document the performance of a service provider application most reports are be prepared at the end of a contract interval to report the service level to the subscribers reports supported by the disclosed method and system include for example a violation report that contains details regarding slo violations and measured data values an sla contract report that describes the sla from a single contract perspective and a performance report that provides details of performance based on measured data values figs  and  illustrate examples of the types of reports that are supported by the disclosed system sla system capacity according to the described sla engine the slometric processing capabilities may be extended by applying additional servicemetering packages each servicemetering package may define additional monitor technologies and supported metrics a well defined metric definition document is also supplied by each additional servicemetering package which can be applied to the sla system service metering overview in one embodiment the service metering software application  is responsible for performing the functions of blocks  the service metering software application  enables a service provider and its customers to gauge the usage and performance of its system the service metering application  also provides substantial data for quantitative analysis which reflects the activity of the system the service metering application  may employ any data collection techniques which allow the application lo gather useful information from a variety of sources and from different applications the service metering application  may include a number of predefined slos to reflect the type of data collected throughout the system it can be used by asp aggregator to calculate metrics from multiple asps it can also be used as verification tools for a client and to verify the quality of services provided by a service provider the service metering application  includes at least one data collection agent  and a data director  the data collection agents  include technology to gather information for multiple metrics including for example real time events transaction data and raw data currently many service providers charge their clients according to a flat fee with the described service metering application  a service provider may differentiate the level of quality service provided to its client for example a service provider may charge by usage of time number of transactions duration or number of bytes transferred typically customers measure their service providers in terms of uptime bandwidth scalability security and problem resolution in the future customers may wish to measure their providers in terms of cost savings cycletime reduction and customer retention and supply chain efficiency the service metering application  enables a service provider to match up with present and future customer expectations the exemplary service level manage and service metering applications enable management and metering of system resources according to certain categories such as for example application platform operation and network
