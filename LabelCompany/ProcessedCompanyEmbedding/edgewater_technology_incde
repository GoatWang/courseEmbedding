believes however that certain nongaap financial measures used in managing the company’s business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results certain of the information set forth herein and certain of the information presented by the company from time to time may constitute nongaap financial measures within the meaning of regulation g adopted by the securities and exchange commission we have presented herein a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure the nongaap measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies as noted below the foregoing measures have limitations and do not serve as a substitute and should not be construed as a substitute for gaap performance but provide supplemental information concerning our performance that our investors and we find useful edgewater views adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue as important indicators of performance consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the company’s performance we believe adjusted ebitda measures are important performance metrics because they facilitate the analysis of our results exclusive of certain noncash items including items which do not directly correlate to our business operations  the nongaap adjustments and the basis for excluding them are outlined below income tax provision  the exit of our former significant unrelated operations in  and  created significant net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets and the tax provisions that we take under gaap for which there is no corresponding federal tax payment obligation for us and the adjustments that we make to our deferred tax asset based on the prospects and anticipated future profitability of our ongoing operations can be significant and can obscure either significantly or in part periodtoperiod changes in our core operating results depreciation and amortization  we incur expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets that is primarily related to the various acquisitions we have completed we believe that eliminating this expense from our nongaap financial measures is useful to investors because the amortization of intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the individual acquisition transactions which also vary substantially in frequency from periodtoperiod stockbased compensation expense  we incur stockbased compensation expense under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  “ compensation – stock compensation ” we exclude this noncash expense as we do not believe it is reflective of business performance the nature of stockbased compensation expense also makes it very difficult to estimate

cloudbased “the oracle channel still appears to have considerable activity in the onpremise arena  edgewater ranzal has been working hard to adjust its sales and marketing strategies to accommodate oracle’s slower and more methodical rollout of cloud modules  the acceleration of our cloud service revenue growth in the oracle channel is highly dependent on the gradual availability of new cloud products and the customers’ desire to leverage their existing on premise software applications “our consulting practice continues to show acceleration in providing advisory services for digital transformation and the cloud “we anticipate that service revenue will be in the range of  million to  million during the first quarter of    for the full year  the company is targeting low singledigit

investors and we find useful edgewater views adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue as important indicators of performance consistent with the manner in which management

revenue and cost of revenue the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers the total number of our projects that require travel and whether our arrangements with our customers provide for the reimbursement of travel and other projectrelated expenses with the offering of a productbased consulting model software revenue will continue to be a meaningful portion of our revenues software revenue driven by resales of microsoft dynamics ax product represented   and  of revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively software and maintenance revenue are recognized upon delivery except in the infrequent situation where the company provides maintenance services in which case the related maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance    table of contents period while the software revenue is recognized upon delivery software revenue is expected to fluctuate between quarters dependent on our customers demand for such thirdparty offtheshelf software fluctuations in software revenue may have an impact upon our periodic operating performance including gross margin operating expenses the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of cash and noncash compensation and benefits associated with our project consulting personnel and related expenses noncash compensation includes sharebased compensation expense arising from restricted stock and option grants to employees project personnel expenses also consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with our professional staff other related expenses include travel subcontracting costs thirdparty vendor payments and nonbillable expenses associated with the delivery of services to our customers we consider the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue to be an important measure of our operating performance the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base the prices we charge our customers and the nonbillable costs associated with securing new customer engagements and developing new service offerings the remainder of our recurring operating expenses consists of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our customerserving professionals such as professional development and recruiting marketing and sales and management and administrative support professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance information systems human resources facilities including the rent of office space and other administrative support for project personnel the company regularly reviews its fees for services professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that its services and compensation are competitive within the industry and that its overhead costs are balanced with its revenue levels in addition we monitor the progress of customer projects with customer senior management the company manages the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements however a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned in addition because most of our customer engagements are terminable by our customers without penalty an unanticipated termination of a customer project could require us to maintain underutilized employees while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements the company must also maintain a sufficient number of consulting professionals to oversee existing customer engagements and to participate in sales activities to secure new customer assignments direct acquisition costs the company incurred  thousand of direct acquisition costs during the year ended december   which were related to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of m dynamics in the year ended december   incurred expenses included investment banking fees legal fees accounting and other professional fees directly associated with completion of the acquisitions the company incurred  million of direct acquisition costs related to the acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of zeroten branchbird and m dynamics in the year ended december   during the first quarter of  the company incurred approximately  thousand of direct acquisition costs associated with the march   zeroten acquisition during the third quarter of  the company incurred approximately  thousand of direct acquisition costs associated with the august   branchbird acquisition during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred approximately  thousand of direct acquisition costs associated with the december   m dynamics acquisition incurred expenses included investment banking fees legal fees accounting and other professional fees directly associated with completion of the acquisitions    table of contents consent solicitation expense during the year ended december   the company

expenses in connection with its defense against a consent solicitation no such expenses were incurred in the year ended december   adjustments to fair value of contingent consideration the company remeasures the estimated carrying value of contingent consideration each quarter with any changes income or expense in the estimated fair value recorded as an operating expense classified as change in fair value of contingent earnout consideration accretion of the contingent earnout liability is classified as other expense on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income as of december   and december   the company had  million and  million respectively accrued in connection with the contingent earnout obligations associated with the zeroten branchbird and m dynamics acquisitions the decrease in accrued contingent earnout consideration is driven by the payment of  million related to the completion of the first zeroten earnout period and to a lesser extent adjustments to fair value of the remaining liabilities partially offset by accretion of the contingent liabilities growth through acquisitions the companys goal is to position itself as one of the leading providers of transformational classic and productbased consulting services in north america by growing its customer base leveraging its industry expertise to enhance its service offerings and continuing to make disciplined strategic acquisitions previous acquisitions including but not limited to its acquisitions of zeroten branchbird and m dynamics have further expanded its geographical footprint increased its vertical expertise and provided more scale to our organization the company will continue to evaluate the possibility of growth through acquisition in future years company performance measurement systems and metrics the companys management monitors and assesses its operating performance by evaluating key metrics and indicators on an ongoing basis for example we regularly review performance information related to annualized revenue per billable consultant periodic consultant utilization rates gross profit margins average bill rates and billable employee headcount edgewater has also developed internal enterprise performance management systems which aid us in measuring our operating performance and consultant utilization rates the matching of sales opportunities to available skill sets in our consultant base is one of our greatest challenges and therefore we monitor consultant utilization closely these metrics along with other operating and financial performance metrics are used in evaluating managements overall performance these metrics and indicators are discussed in more detail under results for the year ended december   compared to results for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made these estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented to the extent there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our financial statements may be affected the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets revenue recognition    table of contents goodwill other intangible assets and impairment of longlived assets purchase price allocation and valuation of contingent earnout consideration senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee see item   financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap we have identified the policies listed below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets in determining our current income tax provision we assess temporary differences resulting from different treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis in evaluating our deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we must project future levels of taxable income this assessment requires significant judgment recovery of the deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving such projections and failure to do so would result in an increase in the valuation allowance in a future period we have net deferred tax assets that have arisen primarily as a result of timing differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits our ability to realize a deferred tax asset is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income as is our practice we assess on a routine periodic basis the estimated future realizability of the gross carrying value of our net deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis our periodic assessments take into consideration both positive evidence future profitability projections for example and negative evidence historical cumulative loss position for example as it relates to evaluating the future recoverability of our deferred tax assets as of december   the gross carrying value of the companys net deferred tax assets was  million this amount consisted of approximately  million in federal nol carryforwards  million in state nol carryforwards  million in available federal credits  million in future tax benefits related to sharebased compensation expense and  million in net deferred tax assets related to other temporary differences the company maintained a  million and  million valuation allowance against the gross carrying value of its net deferred tax assets as of december   and  respectively during the years ended december   and  in connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated future realizability of our net deferred tax attributes we recorded a noncash tax charge of  million and  million respectively in connection with an increase to the previously established valuation allowance recorded against the gross carrying value of our net deferred tax assets the company considers scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters including the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable in assessing the need for and the amount of the valuation allowance in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in the future periods further adjustments to our valuation allowance may be recorded which could materially impact our financial position and net loss income in the period of the adjustment    table of contents revenue recognition our company recognizes revenue primarily through the provision of consulting services and the resale of thirdparty offtheshelf software and maintenance we recognize revenue by providing consulting services under written service contracts with our customers the service contracts we enter into generally fall into three specific categories time and materials fixedprice and retainer time and materialsbased contracts represented   and  of service revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively revenue related to our service offerings is recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned when a customer enters into a time and materials fixedprice or a periodic retainerbased contract we recognize revenue in accordance with our evaluation of the deliverables in each contract if the deliverables represent separate units of accounting we then measure and allocate the consideration from the arrangement to the separate units based on reliable evidence of fair value for each deliverable revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates revenue pursuant to fixedprice contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting over the course of a fixedprice contract we routinely evaluate whether revenue and profitability should be recognized in the current period we estimate the proportional performance on our fixedprice contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of costs and revenue earned can be made based on historical experience and milestones identified in any particular contract if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion revenue is recognized upon completion of performance subject to any warranty provisions or other project management assessments as to the status of work performed if our initial estimates of the resources required or the scope of work to be performed on a fixedprice contract are inaccurate or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period a provision for estimated losses on incomplete projects is made any known or probable losses on projects are charged to operations in the period in which such losses are determined a formal project review process takes place quarterly although projects are evaluated on an ongoing basis management reviews the estimated total direct costs on each contract to determine if the estimated amounts are accurate and estimates are adjusted as needed in the period revised estimates are made no material losses were recognized on fixedprice contracts during the years ended december    or  we also perform services on a periodic retainer basis under infrastructure service contracts which include monthly hosting and support services revenue under periodic retainerbased contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period as outlined within the respective contract in the event additional services are required above the minimum retained or contracted amount then such services are billed on a time and materials basis typically the company provides warranty services on its fixedprice contracts related to providing customers with the ability to have any design flaws remedied andor have our company fix routine defects the warranty services as outlined in the respective contracts are provided for a specific period of time after a project is complete the company values the warranty services based upon historical labor hours incurred for similar services at standard billing rates revenue related to the warranty provisions within our fixedprice contracts is recognized as the services are performed or the revenue is earned the warranty period is typically for a  day period after the project is complete we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we establish billing terms at the time at which the project deliverables andor milestones are agreed our standard payment terms are  days from invoice date outofpocket reimbursable expenses charged to customers are reflected as revenue    table of contents customer prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred classified as deferred revenue and recognized over future periods as services are performed as of december   and  the company recorded a deferred liability of approximately  thousand and  thousand respectively which is included in the financial statement caption of deferred revenue related to customer prepayments software revenue represents the resale of certain thirdparty offtheshelf software and related maintenance and is recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction whereby we have credit risk and we set the price to the end user in the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the software sale transaction and act as an agent software revenue will be recorded on a net basis revenue from software resale arrangements represented   and  of total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively the majority of the software sold by the company is delivered electronically for software that is delivered electronically we consider delivery to have occurred when the customer either a takes possession of the software via a download that is when the customer takes possession of the electronic data on its hardware or b has been provided with access codes that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware pursuant to an agreement or purchase order for the software the company enters into multiple element arrangements which typically include software postcontract support or maintenance and consulting services consistent with the software described above maintenance that is in the form of a pass through transaction is recognized upon delivery of the software as all related warranty and maintenance is performed by the primary software vendor and not the company maintenance fee revenue for the companys software products which is inconsequential in all years presented is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements which are generally for a oneyear period the company has established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe with respect to the services provided for which revenue is recognized as the services are performed allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable that have been deemed to have a high risk of collectability management reviews its accounts receivable balances on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables are potentially uncollectible management further analyzes historical collection trends and changes in its customer payment patterns customer concentration and credit worthiness when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts the company includes any accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be potentially uncollectible along with a general reserve in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue or bad debts as appropriate in the period the risk is identified based on the information available management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate however future writeoffs could exceed the recorded allowance goodwill other intangible assets and impairment of longlived assets business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually on december  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we record intangible assets at fair value at the time of acquisition our intangible assets consist primarily of noncompete    table of contents arrangements customer relationships and trade names and trademarks we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straightline method or based on estimated future cash flows to approximate the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset will be utilized goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level utilizing the fair value methodology factors the company considers important that could trigger an interim review for impairment include but are not limited to the following  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of its use of acquired assets or the strategy for its overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in its stock price for a sustained period and  significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the twostep process the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit the first step if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value a second step must be followed to calculate impairment the second step otherwise if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date in its review of the carrying value of the goodwill the company determines fair values for the reporting units using the income approach or more specifically the discounted cash flow method and the market approach    mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch most popular oj simpson made over  while in prison and won’t have to give any of it to

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
