settlementsprocessinvestor relationsabout uscontact us view on mobilelife settlements homelife settlementsprocessinvestor relationsabout uscontact us how does sundance view life settlementslife settlements represent the market for life insurance policies for us policyholders that no longer wish to keep their coveragetypically the transaction involves an investor purchasing the policy for an upfront payment to the policy owner and then the investor continues to pay the premiums either monthly or annually and will eventually receive the policy proceeds at maturity  the typical age of the insured for a life settlement transaction is over age  and up to age  the market price that a policyholder receives is based on the death benefit the cost of the insurance ongoing premiums and the age and health of the insured  the industry uses a pricing system of discounting the future cash flows the cost of the ongoing premiums and the value of the death benefit over the life expectancy of the insured  the life expectancy le is estimated in months and is typically  to  the discount rate that the market offers is  to  and sometimes even higher  the ability for an investor to earn  on arated credit is remarkable  the policies trade at this high discount rate because of two primary disadvantages  the “negative yield” or cost of the ongoing premiums and  uncertain maturity  most investors do not prefer investments of an uncertain amount of capital with an estimated but not guaranteed holding period it is the way that sundance strategies addresses these two primary issues that creates the opportunitynegative yield – the way that many investment funds address the cost of ongoing premiums is to raise an amount of capital say m  they then allocate m to acquire policies and reserve m to pay the ongoing premiums  this is very inefficient because the m is being invested at a  expected irr but the m cash reserve is earning maybe  until it is used to pay premiums  the risk for this type of investor is that the m may not be enough to pay the ongoing premiums until the death benefits start to come in which will help pay the ongoing premiums on the remaining portfolio  if the fund depletes its premium reserve it must raise more capital or most likely start to liquidate the portfolio  it is from these liquidations that sundance purchases a portion of its inventorysenior financing – the management of sundance believes that senior financing provides a much better alternative to dealing with the unknown cost of future premiums  if the investment fund described above was able to secure financing then perhaps they would raise m borrow an additional m and use m to acquire policies  the lender would then arrange a line of credit to fund all ongoing premiums  the death benefits as received would be used to retire the outstanding senior debt before the net proceeds are paid to the fund  this would allow x the policies to be purchased for the same initial capital commitment from the investors but a much higher irr on their investment uncertain maturity – the life expectancy “le” that is provided for the investors to consider when purchasing a policy are from one or more of the industry le providers  while they are accurate on a pool of policies  they are not definitive on a single insured  even on a pool of life insurance policies there can be a standard deviation of a year or two on the average expected le compared with actual results mortality reinsurance – one of the best ways to deal with uncertain maturity of a pool of life policies is to purchase mortality reinsurance  this is an insurance policy issued to the owner of a pool of life insurance policies that guarantees a minimum annual cash flow from the pool  the coverage is issued for a period of  years and guarantees that at least  of the death benefits are received as expected  if in any year say year  m of death benefits were anticipated and only m were received then the reinsurance provider would advance approximately m to get the portfolio owner at least  of the expected cashflow  in later years when the death benefits are eventually received the reinsurance is repaid nibs – the management of sundance believes that the best way to capitalize on the life settlement market to acquire policies with the highest irr with the minimum risk is to purchase nibs  these nibs receive the net cash flow from a pool of life settlement policies that have  long term financing for premiums and  mortality reinsurance coverage to guarantee a minimum level of performance by combining these two features sundance will use the capital of the company to acquire nibs on approximately b of policies per year  the net cash flow over the life of the nibs is anticipated to be  to  of the death benefit  the cost of the nibs will be about  of the death benefit  the irr of the investment in nibs is projected to be well above  market returns sundance strategies    homelife

the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract in july  the fasb deferred the effective date of this standard as a result the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its fiscal year

adoption is permitted the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements   in january  the fasb issued asu  regarding financial instruments

classification as either a finance lease or an operating lease will determine how leaserelated revenue and expense are recognized the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   the company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  related to the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments with contingent call or put options this pronouncement clarifies that an exercise contingency does not need to be

with the assistance of europa was obligated to convert the nibs and other newly acquired nibs into “qualified nibs” as soon as del mar met its obligation to provide qualified nibs to the company any remaining nibs and any other consideration and collateral would be returned or released to del mar the original due date for the conversion was december   which date was subsequently extended several times on april   the company finalized an amendment to the del mar ata and the related europa agreement to extend the deadline until august     the remaining consideration and collateral under the del mar ata as of september   primarily consisted of approximately  of the nibs associated with a portfolio of life settlement policies having a face value that originally totaled  the remaining  interested in the nibs were held by other parties during june  one of the life settlement policies matured for  the “matured policy” lowering the remaining face value of such life settlement policies to  the premiums and expenses related to the maintenance of these life insurance policies are financed by a loan from a lender   as del mar was unable to provide the required amount of qualified nibs by the extended due date of august   effective september   the agreements with del mar and europa were cancelled and the company obtained full ownership and control of the collateral which included the above mentioned approximately  of the nibs associated with the  face value of life settlement policies and certain rights to net proceeds relating to the matured policy   on september   the company transferred to investment in nibs the remaining balance of advances and expense payments to del mar totaling  which approximates fair value this amount was residing in advance for investment in nibs before being transferred to investment in nibs see note    the bulk of the  proceeds paid in connection with the matured policy were used to repay loans secured by such matured policy however on september   the company received  as a result of the rights associated with the matured policy these proceeds were allocated  to pay off a note receivable including interest  to reimburse the company for expense payments made to or on behalf of del mar and  as a refund of advance payments previously made to or on behalf of del mar as part of the del mar ata the  and  proceeds which together total  were applied to reduce advance for investment in nibs   in addition to obtaining full and unrestricted rights to the nibs upon termination of the del mar ata and europa agreement the company also is entitled to receive liquidated damages from del mar in an amount equal to  of any cash advances made under the del mar ata the company is currently determining the extent of the liquidated damages claim and del mar’s ability to pay any such liquidated damages the liquidated damages are computed pro rata based upon the percentage of qualified nibs delivered by del mar under the del mar ata the company received  in qualified nibs or approximately  of the  in qualified nibs due under the del mar ata accordingly once  of its costs and expenses are deducted the company would be entitled to receive the remaining amount of its costs and expenses times two as liquidated damages as a result of the termination the company has no further payment obligations to del mar or fee obligations to europa              sundance strategies inc and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements june    investment in net insurance benefits   investment in nibs for the three months ended june   and the fiscal year ended march   were as follows     june     march   beginning balance             transfers from advance for investment in nibs     —            accretion of interest income               cash received on accrued interest income           —     additional purchases     —         —     distributions of investments     —         —     impairment of investments     —         —     total               as explained in note  the company transferred  from advance for investment in nibs into investment in nibs on september       the estimated fair value of the company’s investment in nibs approximated carrying value at june   with fair value calculated using level  inputs as there is little observable market data available and management is required to use significant judgment in its estimates     during april  the company received  in cash proceeds associated with the  maturity explained in note  and miscellaneous adjustments to other underlying policies the cash proceeds had the effect of reducing accrued interest on nibs   the investment in nibs is a residual economic beneficial interest in a portfolio of life insurance policies that have been financed by an independent third party via a loan from a senior lender and insured via a mortality risk insurance product or mortality reinsurance “mri”  future expected cash flow is defined as the net insurance proceeds from death benefits after senior debt repayment mortality risk repayment and service provider or other thirdparty payments the company is not responsible for maintaining premiums or other expenses related to maintaining the underlying life insurance contracts therefore the investment in nibs balance on the company’s balance sheet does not increase when premiums or other expenses are paid   the company holds a  interest in the nibs relating to the underlying life insurance policies as of march   during the year ended march   we acquired nibs in which the holders of the underlying policies only owned  therefore as of june   the company holds between  and  in the nibs relating to the underlying life insurance policies   the company accounts for its investment in nibs      at the initial investment value increased for interest income and decreased for cash receipts received by the company  at the time of transfer or purchase of an investment in nibs the company estimates the future expected cash flows and determine the effective interest rate based on these estimated cash flows and our initial investment based on this effective interest rate the company calculates accretable income which is recorded as interest income on investment in nibs in the statement of operations  our current projections are based off of various assumptions including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts expected maturity events changes in discount rates life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums interest and other costs incurred among other items these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income as a result actual results could differ significantly from these projections therefore subsequent to the purchase and on a regular basis these future estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes if the determination is made that the future estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted a revised effective yield is calculated prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment including accrued accretion any positive or adverse change in cash flows that does not result in the recognition of an “otherthantemporary impairment” “otti” results in a prospective increase or decrease in the effective interest rate used to recognize interest income we have not recognized any significant adverse change in future estimated cash flows relating to our investment in nibs from our inception in  to the period ended june   during the quarter ended june   and in conjunction with the  cash received in april  the company received updated information from the policy holders regarding reduced management fees relating to maintaining the underlying policies and favorable changes in the senior debt balances and related loantovalue ratios these changes prompted the company to reevaluate and make appropriate adjustments to the cash flow models used to calculate accretable income which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the nibs the resulting increase on the interest income on investment in nibs for the period ending june   was  over the accretable income that would have been recognized under the prior models this increase had no significant effect on the company’s earnings per share          sundance strategies inc and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements june      notes payable and linesofcredit related party   as of june   the company had borrowed  excluding accrued interest from related parties under notes payable and linesofcredit agreements that allow for borrowings of up to  through the earlier of august   or when the company completes a successful equity raise at which time principal and interest is due in full the notes payable and linesofcredit incur interest at  allow for origination fees and are collateralized by investment in nibs during the three months ended june   the company borrowed an additional  under these agreements the company also repaid  during the three months ended june   as of august   the company can still borrow up to  on these linesofcredit the related parties include a person who is the chairman of the board of directors and a stockholder and radiant life llc an entity partially owned by the chairman of the board of directors    notes payable transferred to redeemed common stock payable   at march   the company owed  including accrued interest for notes payable during the year ended march   the company had accrued an additional  in interest the note incurred interest at  was collateralized by nibs and was due in april  during june  the note payable and related accrued interest were converted to equity through the issuance of  shares of common stock and the holder was granted the right to require the company to redeem the common stock for  per share on june   the holder exercised a portion of the redemption right relating to  shares and as a result the company paid the holder  to redeem the shares on march   the holder exercised the redemption right in relation to the remaining shares and on april   the company paid the holder an additional  to redeem the remaining shares at march   the  associated with the redemption had been classified on the balance sheet as mandatorily redeemable common stock    convertible debenture agreement   the company has entered into an  convertible debenture agreement with satco international ltd that allows for borrowings of up to  the holder originally had the option to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest to unregistered restricted common stock of the company on june   per the agreement the number of shares issuable at conversion shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest by  of the  day average closing price of the company’s common stock from the date the notice of conversion is received and the price at which the debenture may be converted will be no lower than  per share the original maturity date was june   but was later extended to may   on june   the company agreed to amend the  convertible debenture agreement that extended the due date and conversion rights to august   as of june   the company owed  under the agreement excluding accrued interest as of august   the company is still able to borrow up to  on this agreement   liquidity and capital requirements   since the company’s inception on january   its operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity debt financing lines of credit from related parties and the issuance of notes payable and convertible debentures as of june   the company had  of cash assets compared to  as of march   as of august   the company has access to draw an additional  on the notes payable and linesofcredit related party see note  and  on the convertible debenture agreement see note  the company’s monthly expenses are between approximately  and  which includes salaries of our employees consulting agreements and contract labor general and administrative expenses and estimated legal and accounting expenses the company believes that its existing capital resources together with the issuance of additional notes payable and convertible debentures and availability under its existing lines of credit with related      sundance strategies inc and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements june   parties will be sufficient to fund its operating working capital requirements for at least the next  months or through august   while the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund its projected operating requirements through august   it does not anticipate having adequate cash flows from operations for three to four years and until a revenue stream has been established it will require debt or equity financing to fund its current and intended business and any future purchases of nibs   if the company is unable to raise sufficient capital through the planned securities and debt offerings or other alternative sources of financing management will curtail nib purchases under this plan expenditures for nibs will be curtailed    the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which the company is expected to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business to continue as a going concern beyond the period ended june   and in order to continue to purchase nibs the company will need to raise additional capital to fund operations and purchase nibs absent additional financing the company will not have the resources to execute its current business plan and continue operations    commitments and contingencies   as explained in note  the company is focused on the purchase and sale of nib’s based on life settlements or life insurance policies the company does not take possession or control of the policies the holder of the life settlements or life insurance policies acquire such policies at a discount to their face value the holder has available credit to pay premiums and expenses on the underlying policies until settlement on settlement the company receives the net insurance benefit after all borrowings interest and expenses have been paid by the holder out of the settlement proceeds however in the event of default of the holder the company may be required to expend funds on premiums interest and servicing costs over the next five years to protect its interest in nibs though the company has no legal responsibility nor adequate funds for these payments in the event that neither party fulfils the financial obligations pertaining to the premiums interest and servicing costs the company would be required to evaluate its investment in nibs for possible adverse impairment    subsequent events   management has considered subsequent events through august   the date these financial statements were

read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the commission   overview   we are engaged in the business of purchasing residual economic interests in a portfolio of life settlements a life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance policy to a third party for more than the policy’s cash surrender value but less than the face value of the policy benefit after the sale the new policy holder will pay the premiums due on the policy until maturity and then collect the settlement proceeds at maturity   we do not purchase or hold life settlement or life insurance policies but rather hold a contractual right to receive the net insurance benefits or nibs from a portfolio of life insurance policies held by a third party these nibs represent an indirect residual ownership interest in a portfolio of individual life insurance policies and they allow us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies after expenses related to the acquisition financing insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our nibs have been paid   we are not responsible for maintaining premiums or other expenses related to maintaining the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies ownership of the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies and the related obligation to maintain such policies remains with the entity that holds such policies   nibs are generally sold by an entity that holds the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies either directly or indirectly through a subsidiary such an entity being referred to herein as a “holder” a holder either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary purchases life insurance policies either from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio of policies at the time of purchase the holder also i contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the policies until maturity ii purchases mortality reinsurance “mri” coverage under which payments will be made to the holder in the event the insurance policies do not mature according to actuarial life expectancies and iii arranges financing to cover the initial purchase of the insurance policies the servicing of the life insurance policies until maturity and the payment of the mri premiums the financing obtained by the holder for a portfolio of life settlement or life insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies for which the financing was obtained after a holder purchases policies aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for the servicing mri coverage and financing the holder contracts to sell nibs related to the policies which gives the holder of the nibs the right to receive the proceeds from the settlement of the insurance policies after all of the expenses related to such policies have been paid when an insurance policy underlying our nibs comes to maturity the insurance proceeds are first used to pay expenses associated with such policy once all of the expenses have been paid the holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds and then will pay the remaining insurance proceeds to us in satisfaction of our related nibs   we began purchasing nibs during our fiscal year ended march         plan of operations   our plan of operation for the next  months is to continue the acquisition and possible sale of nibs this is not a market sector without competition and at present we are a minor competitor we will need substantial additional funds to effectively compete in this industry and no assurance can be given that we will be able to adequately fund our current and intended operations whether through revenues generated from our current interest in our nibs or through debt or equity financing we may be required to expend funds on premiums interest and servicing costs over the next five years to protect our interest in nibs though we have no legal responsibility nor adequate funds for these payments in the event that neither party fulfils the financial obligations pertaining to the premiums interest and servicing costs we would be required to evaluate our investment in nibs for possible adverse impairment these payments are currently being made through an unrelated senior lending facility    we currently estimate proceeds of approximately  million on the nibs we owned as of june   and acquired from pch financial sarl a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under the laws of the grand duchy of luxembourg “pch” del mar financial sarl a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under the laws of the grand duchy of luxembourg “del mar” and hfii assets solutions llc a delaware limited liability company “hfii”  this amount is based on the estimated proceeds from polices of  million in face value which includes estimated return of premiums less the senior loan debt and mri repayments outstanding of approximately  million expected premium payments of  million over the life expectancies of the insured persons in these portfolios and estimated expenses and interest of approximately  million over the term of the senior loans   we use an estimation methodology to project cash flows and returns as presented the estimation model requires many assumptions including but not limited to the following i an assumption that the distinct number of lives in our portfolio would exhibit similar experience to a statistically diverse portfolio from which mortality tables have been created ii an assumption that the life expectancies the “le” or “les” provided by le providers represent the actuarial mean of the life expectancies of the insureds in our portfolio iii the weighted average of the les provided by the le providers represents an appropriate method for adjusting for discrepancies in the les iv life expectancy tables and projections are accurate v the minimum premiums calculated based on the inforce illustrations provided by life insurance carriers are accurate and will not change over the course of the lifetime of our portfolio and vi the holders’ lender fees mri fees and insurance servicing and custodial fees will not change materially over time while this method of modeling cash flows is helpful in providing a theoretical expectation of potential returns that might be produced from our nibs portfolio actual cash flows and returns inevitably will be different possibly materially due to the fact that predicting the exact date of death of any individual is virtually impossible the provision of a theoretical cash flow model is by no means any guarantee of any results the actual performance of these nib interests as well as our future expectations as to what such performance might be may differ substantially from our expectations especially if any of the assumptions change or differ from our initial assumptions these portfolios currently contain only  fractionalized policies on  individual insureds though insurance rating agencies have stated that at least  lives are required to achieve actuarial stability many risk factors beyond these assumptions may result in our expectations being incorrect therefore no assurance can be given that these estimated results will occur   results of operations   income recognition   at the time of transfer or purchase of an investment in nibs we estimate the future expected cash flows from such nibs and determine the effective interest rate that when applied to our initial investment in such nibs would yield these estimated cash flows the company accrues income on a monthly basis by applying this interest rate to our investment in the related nibs and such income is recorded as interest income on investment in nibs in the statement of operations this accretable income is based on the effective yield method and effectively represents the total amount of cash flows we expect to receive over the life of each pool of nibs less the amount of our initial investment in such nibs subsequent to the purchase of a given pool of nibs and on a regular basis these future    estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes if we determine that the future estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted a revised effective yield is calculated and applied prospectively any positive or adverse change in cash flows that does not result in the recognition of an “otherthantemporary impairment” “otti” results in a prospective increase or decrease in the effective interest rate used to recognize interest income we have not recognized any significant adverse change in future estimated cash flows relating to our investment in nibs since inception       threemonths ended june   compared with threemonths ended june     interest income   interest income on investment in nibs totaled  and  for the three months ended june   and  respectively  the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of additional nibs in september  and adjustments to the cash flow models during the quarter ended june   which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the nibs   general  administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses totaled  and  during the three months ended june   and  respectively  a significant portion of these expenses were professional fees payroll and travel expenses and the increase was mainly due to an increase professional fees including accounting and legal fees related to our yearend audit as well as increased travel expenses       other income and expenses   other income and expenses primarily consist of interest on the note payable relatedparty and convertible debenture as well as interest income during the three months ended june   and  interest expense has accrued in the amount of  and  respectively     income taxes   during the three months ended june   and  we recorded net income for financial reporting purposes but had no income tax expense due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards which are fully reserved with a valuation allowance   liquidity and capital resources since our inception our operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity debt financing lines of credit and notes payable from related parties and the issuance of convertible debentures as of june   we had  of cash assets compared to  as of march   our monthly cash expenses are between approximately  and  which includes salaries of our employees consulting agreements and contract labor general and administrative expenses and estimated legal and accounting expenses we believe that our existing capital resources together with the issuance of additional notes payable and convertible debentures and availability under our existing lines of credit with related parties will be sufficient to fund our operating working capital requirements for at least the next  months or through august   while we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected operating requirements through august   we do not anticipate having adequate cash flows from operations for three to four years and until a cash flow stream from nibs has been established we will require debt or equity financing to fund our current and intended business and any future purchases of nibs as a result we believe that we will need to raise approximately  million in additional funds through equity or debt financing to fully expand on our business model during  and beyond although we are actively pursuing opportunities to raise additional equity and debt capital funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all also market conditions may prevent us from accessing the debt and equity capital markets if we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings the ownership interest of our existing stockholders    will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences or other terms that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights or further complicate raising additional capital in the future if we raise additional capital through debt financing we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends if we are unable for any reason to raise needed capital we may need to reduce or discontinue operations   we raised  gross in our private placement that commenced in april  during the three months ended june   we used  in financing activities compared to  net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended june   during the three months ended june   the company borrowed an additional  under the notes payable and lines of credit related party agreements the company also repaid  during the three months ended june   in addition during the three months ended june   we paid out the  mandatorily redeemable common stock payable recorded on the balance sheet as of march     during march  we agreed to pay  in cash issue  shares of common stock and forgive a note receivable with an outstanding amount of  in exchange for relief of a  note payable and the receipt of nibs the net consideration given for the relief of the note payable and receipt of nibs totaled  and  respectively for a total of  the holder of the shares issued pursuant to the transaction was given the right to require us to redeem  shares for  per share  in total on june   the holder exercised a portion of the redemption right relating to  shares and as a result the company paid the holder  to redeem the shares on march   the holder exercised the redemption right in relation to the remaining shares and on april   the company paid the holder an additional  to redeem the remaining shares at march   the  associated with the redemption had been classified on the balance sheet as mandatorily redeemable common stock for the three months ended june   we recorded net cash provided by operating activities of  compared to  used in operating activities during the three months ended june   the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to the receipt of approximately   which was an approved distribution from the policy holders as a return on our interest in nibs during the three month period ended june   we had an unusual net inflow of cash from operating activities however because we are in the early stages of our accretion model we typically expect to use cash from operating activities during most reporting periods    the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which we are expected to be able to realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business to continue as a going concern beyond the period ending august   and to continue to acquire nibs we will need to complete securities and debt offerings or obtain alternative sources of financing absent additional financing we will not have the necessary resources to execute our business plan   debt at june   we owed  including accrued interest for debt obligations including  excluding accrued interest pursuant to notes payable and linesofcredits from related parties and  excluding accrued interest pursuant to an  convertible debenture the notes payable and linesofcredit are due on august   or when the company completes a successful equity raise at which time principal and interest is due in full and the convertible debenture is due august   as of august   there was  available under the notes payable and linesofcredit we currently have with related parties and  available under the  convertible debenture agreement we may borrow money in the future to finance our operations but can make no guarantees that such credit will be made available to us any such borrowing will increase the risk of loss to the debt holder in the event we are unsuccessful in repaying such loans the notes payable and linesofcredit incur interest at  percent allow for origination fees and are collateralized by investment in nibs during the three months ended june   the company borrowed an additional  under these agreements the company also repaid  during the three months ended    june   the related parties include a person who is the chairman of the board of directors and a stockholder and radiant life llc an entity partially owned by the chairman of the board of directors   critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments we base these on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements   item   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the valuation of investment in nibs and related income recognition increases in general interest rates would similarly increase the interest rates used in our financial models such increases would result in decreases in the present value of expected future cash flows from our nibs and as a result decrease income accrued on our investment in nibs   item   controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   our management with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report based on that evaluation our president who is also deemed to be our acting cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the quarterly report were effective and that the information required to be

should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the company’s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march   operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that

condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the operations and cash flows for the periods presented   sundance strategies inc formerly known as java express inc was organized under the laws of the state of nevada on december   and engaged in the retail selling of beverage products to the general public until these endeavors ceased in  it had no material business operations from  until its acquisition of anew life inc “anew life” a subsidiary of sundance strategies inc “sundance strategies” the “company” or “we” the company is engaged in the business of purchasing or acquiring and selling life insurance policies and residual interests in or financial products tied to life insurance policies including notes drafts acceptances open accounts receivable and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of insurance life settlements and related insurance contracts being traded in the secondary marketplace often referred to as the “life settlements market” currently the company is focused on the purchase of net insurance benefit contracts “nibs” based on life settlements or life insurance policies the company does not take possession or control of the policies the owners of the life settlements or life insurance policies acquire such policies at a discount to their face value the owners have available credit to pay forecasted premiums and expenses on the underlying policies until settlement on settlement the company receives the net insurance benefit after all borrowings interest and expenses have been paid by the owners out of the settlement proceeds the owners of the life insurance policies are variable interest entities vies for which the company has a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary the company’s investment in nibs see note  were issued by the owners ie the vies the company’s maximum exposure to loss in the variable interest entities is limited to the investment in nibs balance the company does not have the power to direct activities of the vies further the company does not have the contractual obligation to absorb losses of the vie beyond the company’s initial investment   the investment in nibs is a residual economic beneficial interest in a portfolio of life insurance contracts that have been financed by an independent third party via a loan from a lender and insured via a mortality risk insurance product or mortality reinsurance “mri”    future expected cash flow and positive profits are defined as the net insurance proceeds from death benefits after senior debt repayment mortality risk repayment and service provider or other thirdparty payments   nibs are in the form of participating debt certificates “pdc” according to the terms of the pdcs the pdcs provide both variable    and fixed interest    return to the company from the owners of the policies    in the form of accrued yield the variable interest varies by individual pdc and is calculated as  to  depending on the pdc of the positive profits from the life insurance assets held by the owners of the policies the fixed interest also      varies by individual pdc and is either  or  per annum of the par value of the pdcs held by the company the par value of the pdcs held by the company is approximately  million the nibs agreements between the company and the owners of the policies contain a provision that allows for the owners to redeem the nibs at any point conditional upon paying to the company the par value of the nibs as well as any unpaid accrued yield   relating to fixed and variable interest    the par value is in excess of the company’s initial investment the company holds between  and  in the nibs relating to the underlying life insurance policies as of december   and march   the company is not responsible for maintaining premiums or other expenses related to maintaining the underlying life insurance contracts therefore the investment in nibs balance on the company’s balance sheet does not increase when premiums or other expenses are paid    the company accounts for its investment in nibs at the initial investment value increased for interest income and decreased for cash receipts received by the company at the time of transfer or purchase of an investment in nibs we estimate the future expected cash flows and determine the effective interest rate based on these estimated cash flows and our initial investment based on this effective interest rate the company calculates accretable income which is recorded as interest income on investment in nibs in the statement of operations subsequent to the purchase and on a regular basis these future estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes if the determination is made that the future estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted a revised effective yield is calculated prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment including accrued accretion our current projections are based off of various assumptions including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts expected maturity events changes in discount rates life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums interest and other costs incurred among other items these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income as a result actual results could differ significantly from these projections therefore subsequent to the purchase and on a regular basis these future estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes if the determination is made that the future estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted a revised effective yield is calculated prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment including accrued accretion any positive or adverse change in cash flows would result in a prospective increase or decrease in the effective interest rate used to recognize interest income any significant adverse change in the cash flows may result in the recognition of an “otherthantemporary impairment” “otti” and would be evaluated by the company accordingly   we evaluate the carrying value of our investment in nibs for impairment on a regular basis and if necessary adjust our total basis in the nibs using new or updated information that affects our assumptions we recognize impairment on a nib contract if the fair value of the beneficial interest are less than the carrying amount of the investment plus anticipated undiscounted future premiums and direct external costs if any and if there are adverse changes in cash flow we have not recognized any impairment on our investment in nibs from january   inception to the periods ended december     in estimating these cash flows for purposes of interest income and impairment calculations there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies these include the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts expected maturity events counter party performance risk changes to applicable regulation of the investment shortage of funds needed to maintain the asset until maturity changes in discount rates life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums interest and other costs incurred among other items these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates   correction of an immaterial error   during the period   ended december   the company identified an error related to its condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for both the cash used in advance for investment in nibs as well as proceeds from refunds on advance for investment in nibs  the company determined that in the prior period reported these amounts were improperly included in cash inflows and outflows as operating activities when they should have been classified as inflows and outflows from investing activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows this error did not affect net income assets liabilities stockholders equity cash flows from financing activities or the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the period in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no  materiality and sab no  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements we evaluated the materiality of the error from qualitative and quantitative perspectives and concluded that the error was immaterial to the current      and prior periods mentioned above consequently the consolidated statement of cash flows contained in these financial statements have been restated for the nine months ended december   the change resulted in a net decrease of  from cash flows used in operating activities and a corresponding increase to cash inflows from investing activities for the period ending december        new accounting pronouncements       the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standard update “asu”   and   and  – revenue from contracts with customers which provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers the core principal of the asus is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the asus also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract in july  the fasb deferred the effective date of this standard as a result the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its fiscal year beginning april   including interim periods within that fiscal year early application is permitted but not before the original effective date of april   entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either retrospective application or recognizing the cumulative effect the asus are not applicable to securitized beneficial interests that derive accreted yields and therefore the company will continue to follow the guidance in asc  the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements   in august  the fasb issued asu  presentation of financial statements—going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern the new standard provides guidance around management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements   in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  the new standard is designed to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and requires all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group as well as any related valuation allowance be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet  the amendments are effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after march    the company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements as the company already reports deferred tax liabilities as long term    in january  the fasb issued asu  regarding financial instruments which amended guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments under the new guidance entities will be required to measure equity investments that are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded in net income unless the entity has elected the new practicability exception for financial liabilities measured using the fair value option entities will be required to separately present in other comprehensive income the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to instrumentspecific credit risk additionally the guidance amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments the standard will be effective for the company’s fiscal year beginning april   including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu  related to the accounting for leases this pronouncement requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheet while expense recognition on the income statement remains similar to current lease accounting guidance the guidance also eliminates real estatespecific provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting under the new guidance lease classification as either a finance lease or an operating lease will determine how leaserelated revenue and expense are recognized the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   the company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on the      consolidated financial statements because leases are monthtomonth and not material to the company’s financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  related to the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments with contingent call or put options this pronouncement clarifies that an exercise contingency does not need to be evaluated to determine whether it relates only to interest rates or credit risk instead the contingent put or call option should be evaluated for possible bifurcation as a derivative in accordance with the fourstep decision sequence detailed in fasb asc  without regard to the nature of the exercise contingency the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   the company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the new standard is designed to simplify the areas of share based payments relating to income tax consequences asu  is effective for the company for its fiscal year beginning april   the company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements   in june  the fasb issued asu  financial instruments  credit losses asu  requires entities to report “expected” credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit rather than the current “incurred loss” model these expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date are to be based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts this asu will also require enhanced disclosures relating to significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of asu  will have on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations   in august  the fasb issued asu  statement of cash flows  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments historically there has been a diversity in practice in how certain cash receiptspayments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows to reduce the existing diversity in practice this update addresses the eight cash flow issues as listed in the pronouncement the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning april   and interim periods within that fiscal year early adoption is permitted the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements   in october  the fasb issued asu  consolidation  interests held through related parties that are under common control which alters how a decision maker needs to consider indirect interests in a variable interest entity vie held through an entity under common control under the new asu if a decision maker is required to evaluate whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie it will need to consider only its proportionate indirect interest in the vie held through a common control party the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning april   including interim periods within that fiscal year the company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements as the company has no related parties under common control that have the characteristics of a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity   the company has reviewed all other recently issued but not yet adopted accounting standards in order to determine their effects if any on its results of operations financial position or cash flows based on that review the company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements       advance for investment in net insurance benefits   on june   the company entered into an asset transfer agreement the “del mar ata” with del mar financial sarl “del mar” as part of the del mar ata the company entered into a structuring and consulting agreement with europa settlement advisors ltd respectively the “europa agreement” and “europa”   the del mar ata involved the purchase of certain life settlement assets consisting of the legal and net beneficial ownership interest in a portfolio of life insurance policies the “nibs” among other assets that are      consideration and collateral for certain cash advances and expense payments made by the company according to the del mar ata del mar with the assistance of europa was obligated to convert the nibs and other newly acquired nibs into “qualified nibs” as soon as del mar met its obligation to provide qualified nibs to the company any remaining nibs and any other consideration and collateral would be returned or released to del mar the original due date for the conversion was december   which date was subsequently extended several times on april   the company finalized an amendment to the del mar ata and the related europa agreement to extend the deadline until august     the remaining consideration and collateral under the del mar ata as of september   primarily consisted of approximately  of the nibs associated with a portfolio of life settlement policies having a face value that originally totaled  the remaining  interest in the nibs were held by other parties during june  one of the life settlement policies matured for  the “matured policy” lowering the remaining face value of such life settlement policies to  the premiums and expenses related to the maintenance of these life insurance policies are financed by a loan from a lender   as del mar was unable to provide the required amount of qualified nibs by the extended due date of august   effective september   the agreements with del mar and europa were cancelled and the company obtained full ownership and control of the collateral which included the above mentioned approximately  of the nibs associated with the  face value of life settlement policies and certain rights to net proceeds relating to the matured policy   on september   the company transferred to investment in nibs the remaining balance of advances and expense payments to del mar totaling  which approximates fair value this amount was residing in advance for investment in nibs before being transferred to investment in nibs see note    the bulk of the  proceeds paid in connection with the matured policy were used to repay loans secured by such matured policy however on september   the company received  as a result of the rights associated with the matured policy these proceeds were allocated  to pay off a note receivable  to pay off accrued interest receivable from prior periods  to pay off interest accrued within the current period  to reimburse the company for expense payments made to or on behalf of del mar and  as a refund of advance payments previously made to or on behalf of del mar as part of the del mar ata the  and  proceeds which together total  were applied to reduce advance for investment in nibs       investment in net insurance benefits   the balance in investment in nibs at december   and march   and related activity for the periods then ended were as follows          december     march   beginning balance             transfers from advance for investment in nibs     –          accretion of interest income               cash received           –   additional purchases     –       –   distributions of investments     –       –   impairment of investments     –       –   total                as explained in note  the company transferred  from advance for investment in nibs into investment in nibs on september            our investment in nibs are classified as heldtomaturity investments    and are included in the longterm assets on the company’s balance sheet the amortized cost aggregate fair value and gross unrecognized holding gains and losses at december   and march   were as follows       december     march             amortized cost basisnet carrying amount             aggregate fair value note                gross unrecognized holding gainslosses                  during april  the company received  in cash proceeds associated with maturities and miscellaneous adjustments to other underlying policies the cash proceeds reduced the carrying value of the company’s investment in nibs   during the quarter ended june   and in conjunction with the  cash received in april  the company received updated information from the policy owners regarding reduced management fees relating to maintaining the underlying policies and favorable changes in the senior debt balances and related loantovalue ratios these changes prompted the company to reevaluate and make appropriate adjustments to the cash flow models used to calculate accretable income which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the nibs the resulting increase on the interest income on investment in nibs for the nine months ending december   was  over the accretable income that would have been recognized under the prior models this increase had no significant effect on the company’s earnings per share        fair value measurements   as defined by asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date asc  also requires the consideration of differing levels of inputs in the determination of fair values   those levels of input are summarized as follows   • level  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   • level  observable inputs other than level  quoted prices such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market   • level  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity level  assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation   the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety   financial instruments not required to be carried at fair value   in accordance

  at march   the company owed  including accrued interest for notes payable during the year ended march   the company had accrued an additional  in interest the note incurred interest at  was collateralized by nibs and was due in april  during june  the note payable and related accrued interest were converted to equity through the issuance of  shares of common stock and the holder was granted the right to require the company to redeem the common stock for  per share on june        the holder exercised a portion of the redemption right relating to  shares and as a result the company paid the holder  to redeem the shares on march   the holder exercised the redemption right in relation to the remaining shares and on april   the company paid the holder an additional  to redeem the remaining shares at march   the  associated with the redemption had been classified on the balance sheet as mandatorily redeemable common stock    convertible debenture agreement   the company has entered into an  convertible debenture agreement with satco international ltd that allows for borrowings of up to  the holder originally had the option to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest to unregistered restricted common stock of the company on june   per the agreement the number of shares issuable at conversion shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest by  of the  day average closing price of the company’s common stock from the date the notice of conversion is received and the price at which the debenture may be converted will be no lower than  per share the original maturity date was june   but was later extended to august   on october   the company agreed to amend the  convertible debenture agreement that extended the due date and conversion rights to february   as of december  and march   the company owed  under the agreement excluding accrued interest the associated interest of  at

company agreed to amend the  convertible debenture agreement to extend the due date and conversion rights to august       liquidity requirements   since the company’s inception on january   its operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity debt financing from related parties and the issuance of notes payable and convertible debentures as of december   the company had  of cash assets compared to  as of march   as of april   the company had access to draw an additional  on the notes payable related party see note  and  on the convertible debenture agreement see note  the company’s average monthly expenses are expected to be approximately  which includes salaries of our employees consulting agreements and contract labor general and administrative expenses and estimated legal and accounting expenses outstanding accounts payable as of december   totaled  and other accrued liabilities totaled  management has concluded that its existing capital resources future proceeds from investment in nibs issuance of additional notes payable and convertible debentures and availability under its existing debt agreements with related parties will be sufficient to fund its operating working capital requirements for at least the next  months or through april  the company continues to evaluate other debt and equity financing opportunities and in august  paid a financing advance of  to a group for a potential lineofcredit offering   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which the company is expected to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business in order to continue to purchase additional nibs the company will likely need to raise additional capital to fund operations       commitments and contingencies   as explained in note  the company is focused on the purchase of nib’s based on life settlements or life insurance policies the company does not take possession or control of the policies the owners of the life settlements or life insurance policies acquires such policies at a discount to their face value the owners have available credit to pay forecasted premiums and expenses on the underlying policies until settlement on settlement the company receives the net insurance benefit after all borrowings interest and expenses have been paid by the o out of the settlement proceeds however in the event of default of the owner the company may be required to expend funds on premiums interest and servicing costs over the next five years to protect its interest in nibs though the company has no legal responsibility nor adequate funds for these payments in the event that neither      party fulfils the financial obligations pertaining to the premiums interest and servicing costs the company would be required to evaluate its investment in nibs for possible adverse impairment in addition see note  relating to associated commitments and contingencies affiliated with life settlements or life insurance policies   during july  a group of persons located in the united states the “purchasers” acquired the entities that owned all of the portfolios of life insurance policies underlying the company’s nibs  in connection with this purchase the purchasers and the respective owners of these portfolios entered into a settlement agreement releasing such owners and their managers from liability related to their ownership and management of the entities that owned the respective portfolios of life insurance contracts  the company and purchasers agreed to indemnify the prior owners of such portfolios against future claims in connection with the issuance of the nibs or their ownership or management of the entities sold based on actions that occurred prior to this sale to the purchasers the company and purchasers further agreed to maintain certain liquidity requirements of the entities underlying the nibs for a period of  months following the acquisition by the purchasers which  month period expired in october  if such liquidity was not provided the company and purchasers were obligated to indemnify the prior owners and managers of the entities against third party claims for unpaid expenses neither the purchase of these entities nor the settlement agreement resulted in any material change in the company’s nibs ownership interest the company was supportive of the purchasers acquiring the entities that owned the portfolios of life insurance contracts underlying the company’s nibs and was willing to provide the indemnification because it believed this ownership change would result in a reduction of costs and expenses associated with ownership of the nibs which would increase their intrinsic value the company was made aware by the purchasers that credit was presently no longer available to pay certain costs to maintain the structure of the underlying life insurance policies the company’s obligations to provide liquidity under the settlement agreement have now expired and the company is not legally obligated for costs incurred by the entities underlying the nibs however if credit does not become available to purchasers from the underlying loans to pay the costs as explained above whether it be by proceeds from a future maturity or other negotiations the company may provide such liquidity to protect its investment in the nibs the total historical unpaid costs incurred prior to the ownership transition and potential unpaid cost incurred after the ownership transition approximates  and  respectively for an estimated total of  the company believes the probable amount it will ultimately pay is approximately  which relates to unpaid costs incurred prior to the transition therefore the company accrued  during the three months ended september   to account for this uncertainty the company anticipates that the total  will be paid by june   and therefore this amount has been recorded as current accrued expense during the three months ended december   the company reassessed this uncertainty and determined that no further adjustment was needed for the amount accrued the company will continue to assess this uncertainty and will adjust the amount accrued as more information becomes available    earnings loss per common share      earnings loss per common share is computed based on the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding and when appropriate dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period stock options and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents the computation of diluted earnings loss per common share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an antidilutive effect   basic earnings loss per common share is the amount of net income loss for the period available to each weightedaverage share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period diluted net earnings loss per common share is the amount of net income loss for the period available to each weightedaverage share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each common stock equivalent outstanding during the period unless inclusion of common stock equivalents would have an antidilutive effect   the reconciliations between the basic and diluted weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended december   and  are as follows                three months ended december    nine months ended december                basic weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period                                                               weightedaverage number of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period            –              –                                     diluted weightedaverage number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period                               in periods with a net loss outstanding options and warrants are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share because they were antidilutive and for the three and nine months ended december   totaled  for each period  for the three and nine months ended december   options to exercise  shares were excluded because they were antidilutive in addition  shares related to the potential conversion of the convertible debenture were excluded because they were antidilutive    income taxes   at march   we placed a  valuation allowance totaling approximately  on the amount our deferred tax assets exceeding our deferred tax liabilities as a result no income tax expense benefit or deferred tax asset or liability was recorded on the financial statement during the nine months ended december   our deferred tax liabilities began to exceed our deferred tax assets which resulted in the recording of income tax expense and a deferred tax liability as a result during the nine months ended december   the  valuation allowance was reversed the deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards and the deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes but not for tax reporting purposes    subsequent events      as explained in note     on february   the notes payable related party were amended to allow for additional borrowings and to extend a due date   as explained in note  on march   the company agreed to amend the  convertible debenture agreement to extend the due date and conversion rights to august       item  management’s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating

whether as the result of new information future events or otherwise the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the commission   overview   we are currently focused on the business of purchasing residual economic interests in a portfolio of life settlements a life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance policy to a third party for more than the policy’s cash surrender value but less than the face value of the policy benefit after the sale the new policy holder will pay the premiums due on the policy until maturity and then collect the settlement proceeds at maturity   we currently do not purchase or hold life settlement or life insurance policies but rather hold a contractual right to receive the net insurance benefits or nibs from a portfolio of life insurance policies held by a third party these nibs represent an indirect residual ownership interest in a portfolio of individual life insurance policies and they allow us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies after expenses related to the acquisition financing insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our nibs have been paid   we are not responsible for maintaining premiums or other expenses related to maintaining the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies ownership of the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies and the related obligation to maintain such policies remains with the entity that holds such policies   nibs are generally sold by an entity that holds the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies either directly or indirectly through a subsidiary such an entity being referred to herein as a “holder” a holder either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary purchases life insurance policies either from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio of policies at the time of purchase the holder also i contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the policies until maturity ii purchases mortality reinsurance “mri” coverage under which payments will be made to the holder in the event the insurance policies do not mature according to actuarial life expectancies and iii arranges financing to cover the initial purchase of the insurance policies the servicing of the life insurance policies until maturity and the payment of the mri premiums the financing obtained by the holder for a portfolio of life settlement or life insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies for which the financing was obtained after a holder purchases policies aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for the servicing mri coverage and financing the holder contracts to sell nibs related to the policies which gives the holder of the nibs the right to receive the proceeds from the settlement of the insurance      policies after all of the expenses related to such policies have been paid when an insurance policy underlying our nibs comes to maturity the insurance proceeds are first used to pay expenses associated with such policy once all of the expenses have been paid the holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds and then will pay the remaining insurance proceeds to us in satisfaction of our related nibs   we began purchasing nibs during our fiscal year ended march         plan of operations   our plan of operation for the next  months is to continue the acquisition of nibs this is not a market sector without competition and at present we are a minor competitor we will need substantial additional funds to effectively compete in this industry and no assurance can be given that we will be able to adequately fund our current and intended operations whether through revenues generated from our current interest in our nibs or through debt or equity financing we may be required to expend funds on premiums interest and servicing costs over the next five years to protect our interest in nibs though we have no legal responsibility nor adequate funds for these payments in the event that neither party fulfils the financial obligations pertaining to the premiums interest and servicing costs we would be required to evaluate our investment in nibs for possible adverse impairment these payments are currently being made through an unrelated senior lending facility    we currently estimate proceeds of approximately  million on the nibs we owned as of december   and acquired from pch financial sarl a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under the laws of the grand duchy of luxembourg “pch” del mar financial sarl a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under the laws of the grand duchy of luxembourg “del mar” and hfii assets solutions llc a delaware limited liability company “hfii”  this amount is based on the estimated proceeds from polices of  million in face value which includes estimated return of premiums less the senior loan debt and mri repayments outstanding of approximately  million expected premium payments of  million over the life expectancies of the insured persons in these portfolios and estimated expenses and interest of approximately  million over the term of the senior loans   we use an estimation methodology to project cash flows and returns as presented the estimation model requires many assumptions including but not limited to the following i an assumption that the distinct number of lives in our portfolio would exhibit similar experience to a statistically diverse portfolio from which mortality tables have been created ii an assumption that the life expectancies the “le” or “les” provided by le providers represent the actuarial mean of the life expectancies of the insureds in our portfolio iii the weighted average of the les provided by the le providers represents an appropriate method for adjusting for discrepancies in the les iv life expectancy tables and projections are accurate v the minimum premiums calculated based on the inforce illustrations provided by life insurance carriers are accurate and will not change over the course of the lifetime of our portfolio and vi the owners’ lender fees mri fees and insurance servicing and custodial fees will not change materially over time while this method of modeling cash flows is helpful in providing a theoretical expectation of potential returns that might be produced from our nibs portfolio actual cash flows and returns inevitably will be different possibly materially due to the fact that predicting the exact date of death of any individual is virtually impossible the provision of a theoretical cash flow model is by no means any guarantee of any results the actual performance of these nib interests as well as our future expectations as to what such performance might be may differ substantially from our expectations especially if any of the assumptions change or differ from our initial assumptions these portfolios currently contain only  fractionalized policies on  individual insureds though insurance rating agencies have stated that at least  lives are required to achieve actuarial stability many risk factors beyond these assumptions may result in our expectations being incorrect therefore no assurance can be given that these estimated results will occur   results of operations   income recognition at the time of transfer or purchase of an investment in nibs we estimate the future expected cash flows from such nibs and determine the effective interest rate that when applied to our initial investment in such nibs      would yield these estimated cash flows we accrue income on a monthly basis by applying this interest rate to our investment in the related nibs and such income is recorded as interest income on investment in nibs in the statement of operations this accretable income is based on the effective yield method and effectively represents the total amount of cash flows we expect to receive over the life of each pool of nibs less the amount of our initial investment in such nibs subsequent to the purchase of a given pool of nibs and on a regular basis these future estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes if we determine that the future estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted a revised effective yield is calculated and applied prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment including accrued accretion any positive or adverse change in cash flows would result in a prospective increase or decrease in the effective interest rate used to recognize interest income any significant adverse change in the cash flows may result in the recognition of an “otherthantemporary impairment” “otti” and would be evaluated by the company accordingly  threemonths ended december   compared with threemonths ended december     interest income   interest income on investment in nibs totaled  and  for the three months ended december   and  respectively  during the quarter ended june   we received updated information from the policy owners regarding reduced management fees relating to maintaining the underlying policies and favorable changes in the senior debt balances and related loantovalue ratios these changes prompted us to reevaluate and make appropriate adjustments to the cash flow models used to calculate accretable income which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the nibs the increase in interest income for the three month period ending december   is primarily due to these adjustments which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the nibs   general  administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses totaled  and  during the three months ended december   and  respectively a significant portion of these expenses were professional fees payroll travel expenses and policy servicing expenses during the three months ended december   the company accrued  as a onetime obligation which was a result of a restructuring with the prior owners of the underlying life insurance portfolios to our nibs   other income and expenses   other expenses primarily consist of interest on the notes payable related party and convertible debenture during the three months ended december   and  interest expense was accrued in the amount of  and  respectively the increase is attributable to higher balances on the notes payable related party     income taxes   during the three months ended december   we recorded net income before income taxes of  and also recorded an income tax expense of  during the three months ended december   we recorded a net loss before income taxes and had no income tax expense           ninemonths ended december   compared with ninemonths ended december     interest income   interest income on investment in nibs totaled  and  for the nine months ended december   and  respectively during the quarter ended june   we received updated information from the policy owners regarding reduced management fees relating to maintaining the underlying policies and favorable changes in the senior debt balances and related loantovalue ratios these changes prompted the company to reevaluate and make appropriate adjustments to the cash flow models used to calculate accretable income which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the nibs the increase in interest income for the three month period ending december   is primarily due to these adjustments which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the nibs in addition to the acquisition of additional nibs in september    general  administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses totaled  and  during the nine months ended december   and  respectively  a significant portion of these expenses were professional fees payroll travel expenses and policy servicing expenses we were made aware that credit was presently no longer available to pay certain costs to maintain the structure of the underlying life insurance policies although we are not legally obligated for costs incurred by the entities underlying the nibs if credit does not become available whether it be by proceeds from a future maturity or other negotiations we may opt to pay certain fees to protect our investment in the nibs we believe the probable amount of fees we will pay will approximate  therefore we have accrued  during the nine months ended december   to account for this uncertainty we will assess this uncertainty throughout the year ended march   and will adjust the amount accrued as more information becomes available policy servicing expenses totaled  and  for the nine months ended december   and  respectively in september  we completed the amortization of our outstanding options and warrants which contributed to the decrease in our general and administrative expenses during july  a group of persons located in the united states the “purchasers” acquired the entities that owned all of the portfolios of life insurance policies underlying the company’s nibs we paid certain legal fees to facilitate this restructuring process the remainder of the decrease in general and administrative expense is largely attributable to the one time legal expenses related to this entity restructuring that occurred during the nine months ended december   other income and expenses   other income and expenses primarily consist of interest on the notes payable related party and convertible debenture as well as interest income during the nine months ended december   and  interest expense has accrued in the amount of  and  respectively the increase is attributable to higher balances on the notes payable related party     income taxes   during the nine months ended december   we recorded net income before income taxes of  and also recorded an income tax expense of  during the nine months ended december   we recorded a net loss before income taxes and had no income tax expense or benefit at march   we placed a  valuation allowance totaling approximately  on the amount our deferred tax assets exceeding our deferred tax liabilities as a result no income tax expense benefit or deferred tax asset or liability was recorded on the financial statement during the nine months ended december   our deferred tax liabilities began to exceed our deferred tax assets which resulted in the recording of income tax expense and a deferred tax liability as a result during the nine months ended december   the  valuation allowance was reversed the deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards and the deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes but not for tax reporting purposes            liquidity and capital resources since our inception our operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity instruments debt financing lines of credit and notes payable from related parties and the issuance of convertible debentures as of december   we had  of cash compared to  as of march   our monthly expenses are approximately  which includes salaries of our employees policy servicing expenses consulting agreements and contract labor general and administrative expenses estimated legal and accounting expenses and accruals for certain costs associated with the underlying life insurance policies mentioned above we believe that our existing capital resources together with the issuance of additional notes payable and convertible debentures and availability under our existing lines of credit with related parties will be sufficient to fund our operating working capital requirements for at least the next  months or through april  while we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected operating requirements through april  we do not anticipate having adequate cash flows from operations for three to four years and until a cash flow stream from nibs has been established we will require debt or equity financing to fund our current and intended business and any future purchases of nibs if we are unable to raise sufficient capital through the planned securities and debt offerings or other alternative sources of financing management will curtail nib purchases   as a result we believe that we will need to raise approximately  million in additional funds through equity or debt financing to fully expand on our business model during  and beyond although we are actively pursuing opportunities to raise additional equity and debt capital funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all also market conditions may prevent us from accessing the debt and equity capital markets if we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences or other terms that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights or further complicate raising additional capital in the future if we raise additional capital through debt financing we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends if we are unable for any reason to raise needed capital we may need to reduce or discontinue operations   we raised  gross in our private placement that commenced in april  during the nine months ended december   and  net cash provided by financing activities was  and  respectively during the nine months ended december   we borrowed an additional  under the notes payable related party agreements we also repaid  during the nine months ended december   in addition during the nine months ended december   we paid out the  mandatorily redeemable common stock payable recorded on the balance sheet as of march   and we also paid  as a financing advance   during march  we agreed to pay  in cash issue  shares of common stock and forgive a note receivable with an outstanding amount of  in exchange for relief of a  note payable and the receipt of nibs the net consideration given for the relief of the note payable and receipt of nibs totaled  and  respectively for a total of  the holder of the shares issued pursuant to the transaction was given the right to require us to redeem  shares for  per share  in total on june   the holder exercised a portion of the redemption right relating to  shares and as a result we paid the holder  to redeem the shares on march   the holder exercised the redemption right in relation to the remaining shares and on april   we paid the holder an additional  to redeem the remaining shares at march   the  associated with the redemption had been classified on the balance sheet as mandatorily redeemable common stock   for the nine months ended december   we recorded net cash used in operating activities of  compared to  used in operating activities during the nine months ended december   the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to the receipt of approximately  which was an approved distribution from the policy owners as a return on our interest in nibs   for the nine months ended december   no cash was used in or provided by investing activities compared to  provided by investing activities during the nine months ended december   during      the nine months ended december   we paid  in cash to del mar as advances for investment in nibs see footnote  to our financials during september  we obtained ownership and control of a portfolio of policies due to the cancellation of the del mar ata  on september   the company received  as a result of the rights associated with a matured policy in the newly obtained portfolio  these proceeds were allocated  to reimburse the company for expense payments made to or on behalf of del mar  to pay off a note receivable including interest and  as a refund of advance payments previously made to or on behalf of del mar as part of the del mar ata   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which we are expected to be able to realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business to continue as a going concern beyond the period ending december   and to continue to acquire nibs we will need to complete securities and debt offerings or obtain alternative sources of financing absent additional financing we will not have the necessary resources to execute our business plan   debt at december   we owed  including accrued interest for debt obligations including  excluding accrued interest pursuant to notes payable from related parties and  excluding accrued interest pursuant to an  convertible debenture of the  of notes payable currently owed as of december    is due august   the remaining  is due november   in the event we complete a successful equity raise principal and interest on both notes payable are due in full at that time the convertible debenture is due august   as of april   there was  available under the notes payable we currently have with related parties and  available under the  convertible debenture agreement we may borrow money in the future to finance our operations but can make no guarantees that such credit will be made available to us any such borrowing will increase the risk of loss to the debt holder in the event we are unsuccessful in repaying such loans the notes payable related party incur interest at  percent and are collateralized by investment in nibs during the nine months ended december   we borrowed an additional  under these agreements we also repaid  during the nine months ended december   the related parties include a person who is the chairman of the board of directors and a stockholder and radiant life llc an entity partially owned by the chairman of the board of directors critical accounting policies and estimates   estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments we base these on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable   income recognition  interest income on investment in nibs represents the excess of all cash flows attributable to the investment in net insurance benefits greater than the initial investment over the life of each pool of net insurance benefits using the effective yield method  changes in the estimate of expected cash flows from investments in nibs would be adjusted prospectively    investment in net insurance benefits in addition to the other accounting policies related to the investment in net insurance benefits detailed in note     of the footnotes to the financial statements the estimating of cash flows for purposes of interest income and impairment calculations there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies these include the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts expected maturity events counter party performance risk changes to applicable regulation of the investment shortage of funds needed to maintain the asset until maturity changes in discount rates life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums interest and other costs incurred among other items these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements        item   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the valuation of investment in nibs and related income recognition increases in general interest rates would similarly increase the interest rates used in our financial models such increases would result in decreases in the present value of expected future cash flows from our nibs and as a result decrease income accrued on our investment in nibs the company’s assessment of market risk as of december   indicates there have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures from those in our annual report on form k for the year ended march   filed with the sec   item   controls and procedures   limitation on the effectiveness of controls   the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information which is required to be disclosed timely is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures we recognize that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures   evaluation of controls and procedures     our management with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   identified material weakness in internal controls   based on that evaluation our principal executive and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the quarterly report were not effective due to a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting relating to processes and controls over review of information with sufficient precision including proper documentation to support accounting conclusions and communication and dissemination of information relevant to financial reporting as defined in sec regulation sx a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result even though no material misstatement was identified in the financial statements it was determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in the company’s financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis   notwithstanding the identified material weakness the company believes the consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on form q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   the company’s plan to remediate the material weakness     our principal executive and principal financial officer is in the preliminary stage of a review of our processes and controls over review of information with sufficient precision including proper documentation to support accounting conclusions and communication and dissemination of information relevant to financial reporting  this includes an evaluation of existing procedures and controls to formalize document and implement new policies and procedures for review of our various financial reporting processes   changes in internal control over financial reporting     other than preceding and as described in item  disclosure controls and procedures there have been no changes in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting have occurred during the company’s fiscal quarter ended december   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal controls over financial reporting          part ii  other information   item  legal proceedings   to the best of our knowledge there are no legal proceedings pending or threatened against us and there are no actions pending or threatened against any of our directors or officers that are adverse to us   item a  risk factors      in addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly report on formq you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our annual report on form k for the year ended march   which risks could materially affect our business financial condition or future results there were no material changes during the quarter ended december   to the risk factors disclosed in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended march   these risks are not the only risks facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or future results   we have identified a material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting although no material misstatements occurred due to these material weaknesses we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december   our ability to remediate these material weaknesses our discovery of additional weaknesses and our inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our results of operations our stock price and investor confidence in our company   section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in more detail under item  controls and procedures of this quarterly report on form q we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of december   due to material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as it relates to our lack communication with and documentation from our legal department to the president and other financial statements preparers   failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting could impair our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis and could lead to a restatement of our financial statements if as a result of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting we cannot provide reliable financial statements our business decision processes may be adversely affected our business and results of operations could be harmed investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our ability to obtain additional financing or additional financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected in addition failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities   our president is currently evaluating options to remediate these material weaknesses however remedial actions have not started or have only recently been undertaken and while we expect to implement our remediation plan through  we cannot be certain as to when remediation will be fully completed the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively additional details regarding the remediation efforts are disclosed in more detail under item  controls and procedures of this quarterly report on form q in addition we may in the future identify additional internal control deficiencies that could rise to the level of a material weakness or uncover errors in financial reporting   item   unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds   there were no sales by us of unregistered securities during the quarter ended december     purchases of equity
