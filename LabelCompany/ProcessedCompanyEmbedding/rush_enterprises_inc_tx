illinois ohio and texas” said rush   “early in  we instituted extensive expense reductions to offset declining revenue including consolidating several locations in our rush truck centers network  these efforts allowed us to manage costs and remain nimble in a down market  additionally we formed a business process management group that has been tasked with improving efficiencies in the way we do business throughout the organization to enable us to increase productivity decrease expenses and better ensure a consistent experience for both our customers and our employees” rush explained “i am

sluggish throughout  “additionally an oversupply of used trucks throughout the industry continues to suppress used truck tradein values negatively impacting new truck sales  we expect used truck

decrease compared to  retail sales  “we believe  is going to be another tough year for class  truck sales  that said many customers are cautiously optimistic about potential economic improvements and

total debt” to reflect the company’s estimated financial obligations less debt related to lease and rental fleet lrfd and floor plan notes payable fpnp and “adjusted net cash debt” to present the amount of adjusted total debt net of cash and cash equivalents on the company’s balance sheet  the fpnp is used to finance the company’s new and used inventory with its principal balance changing daily as vehicles are purchased and sold and the sale proceeds are used to repay the notes  consequently in managing the business management views the fpnp as interest bearing accounts payable representing the cost of acquiring the vehicle that is then repaid when the vehicle is sold as the company’s credit agreements require it to repay loans used to purchase vehicles when such vehicles are sold  the company’s lease  rental fleet are fully financed and are either i leased to customers under longterm lease arrangements or ii to a lesser extent dedicated to the company’s rental business  in both cases the lease and rental payments fully cover the capital costs of the lease  rental fleet ie the principal repayments and interest expense on the borrowings used to acquire the vehicles and the depreciation expense associated with the vehicles plus a profit margin for the company the company believes excluding the fpnp and lrfd from the company’s total debt for this purpose provides management with supplemental information regarding the company’s capital structure and leverage profile and assists investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by company management and research analysts  “adjusted total debt” and “adjusted net cash debt” are both nongaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to and not as a

that excludes the addition of interest expense associated with fpnp to ebitda is consistent with management’s presentation of adjusted total debt in each case reflecting management’s view of interest expense associated with the fpnp as an operating expense of the company and to provide management with supplemental information regarding operating results and to assist investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by management and research analysis  management recorded a charge to selling general and administrative expense during the first and second quarters of  related to the closing of certain dealerships and the disposition of excess real estate  management believes adding back this charge to ebitda provides both the investors and management with supplemental information regarding the company’s core operating results “ebitda” and “adjusted ebitda” are both nongaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to and not as a

company’s ability to generate cash from operating its business  free cash flow is calculated by subtracting the acquisition of property and equipment included in the cash flows from investing activities from net cash provided by used in operating activities  for purposes of deriving adjusted free cash flow from the company’s operating cash flow company management makes the following adjustments i adds back draws or subtracts payments on the floor plan financing that are included in cash flows from financing activities as their purpose is to finance the vehicle inventory that is included in cash flows from operating activities ii adds back proceeds from notes payable related specifically to the financing of the lease and rental fleet that are reflected in cash flows from financing activities iii subtracts draws on floor plan financing net and proceeds from lrfd related to business acquisition assets that are included in cash flows from investing activities iv subtracts principal payments on notes payable related specifically to the financing of the lease and rental fleet that are included in cash flows from financing activities and v adds back
