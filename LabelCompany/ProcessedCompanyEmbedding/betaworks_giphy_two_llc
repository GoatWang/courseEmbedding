yoking asidei attended the yo hackathon in nyc last weekend i’ve written a bit about some theoretical reasons yo could be interesting in the future but it was great to see the wide variety of apps and especially how quickly the hackers built themthe winner was yoauth and it was one of four security apps several leveraged the notion of two factor authentication specifically that access to your phone and requisite thumbprintpass code security means that if you have a phone with your yo account on it you’re probably youyoauth lets websites set up a login process where users register their yo name with the site and can then “yo us to log in” the surprising experience is that without touching the computer the screen automatically changes to being logged in when you tap yo on your phonesome other authentication hacks let people grant and revoke access to their applications using yo namesin their current versions these are probably not quite fully secure but they provide a sign of what can be done on the platformbeyond authentication another interesting app was yocitibike which lets you yo the citibike rack nearest to your home and work and get a yo back if there are more than  open racks to park it’s useful because when you’re stopped at a light on a bike you want the fewest clicks to the informationyou can check out the complete list of hacks on hackerbracket it’s worth noting that the hackathon was only three hours long without the yo api these developers would have had to build fullfledged ios apps which would have taken far longerlooking forward to seeing what else gets built

betaworks giphy takes on google in the redhot market for gif search new  comments by ben popper mar   am edt share tweet linkedin deal with it six weeks ago jace cooke and alex chung two of the hackers in residence at new york innovation lab betaworks shared a fun little product they had cobbled together with about twenty friends it was called giphy and it lets users search a database of around thousands of gifs the animated loops that have become the lingua franca of internet culture word spread like wildfire and by the end of that week with no marketing at all over  people had taken giphy for a spin melting down the notyetastartups one server on several occasions we could tell it struck a nerve so we swarmed it said paul murphy the head of product at betaworks which is home to startups such chartbeat bitly and the newly refreshed digg thats one of the incredible things about betaworks you can just kind of print up a team on demand the team grew to half a dozen developers designers and community managers in the weeks since the launch over half a million users have searched for millions of gifs at first giphy was just pulling its images from a few gif goldmines like tumblr and knowyourmeme but the index has been doubling in size every week since launch the team were preparing a big launch to officially announce the connection to betaworks and the their ambition to build the best gif search and community platform then boom google jumped into the game yesterday afternoon in a small rather unceremonious post on google the search giant announced that it was adding a dropdown option to the search tools menu on all its image searches users would now be able to perform an image search for an exploding robot then filter those results so that only the animated images appear the internet went wild with applause a great thing about betaworks you can print a team on demand the team at giphy has decided not to pack up shop if anything googles move into gif search just weeks after their arrival was sign that they were onto something truly massive and perhaps tech titans were taking notice the strategy going forward is to make giphy about a lot more than search we obviously cant compete with google in terms of crawling the entire web multiple times a day or layering on advanced image recognition algorithms said cooke but we think gifs are more than just data points they are a medium for expression so were going to build giphy into the best place to search curate create remix and share gifs right now giphy hasnt launched tools to let users create and remix gifs but the basic experience is still very satisfying on its homepage giphy displays a simple search bar at the top then a collection of popular trending and handpicked hashtags organized around trending gifs users can search for anything they want or click through the collections of classics like dealwithit foreveralone ryangosling kateupton and of course cats we actually discovered there was an interesting real time element said cooke its really useful when you are looking for the best gif to capture a moment like marco rubios dry mouth jessica lawrence stumble at the oscars or the meteor exploding over russia while giphy is great at capturing and presenting trending topics at this point googles search results are far superior giphy can find you more than a thousand gifs of jennifer lawrence for instance but returns zero results for a more refined search like for jennifer lawrence trips oscars the initial goal in building giphy was to make a fun discovery tool says cooke over the next week were turning on and tweaking a major search improvement allowing you to search across multiple keywords and get stronger related results like you would with traditional search when you do get search results giphy has one major advantage over google you can mouse over a gif in the search results and it will autoplay allowing you to easily browse through a bunch of images without having to click through to each one when you do click through to a gif the service gives you three options for your embed code tiled normal and fullscreen users can also share search results out to facebook and twitter it creates this viral loop says cooke find a gif share a gif click a link find a gif share a gif source giphy more from the verge the game of game

i hybrid supercar giphy — the betaworksbacked platform for searching and sharing gifs — has just raised  million in series b funding led by lightspeed venture partners with participation from general catalyst and previous investors such as lererhippeau betaworks rre ventures and caa ventures a chunk of the round k is being raised through the alphaworks equity crowdfunding platform the investment values giphy at  million and techcrunch sources say that the giphy team originally started shopping for the round in october but got distracted by potential acquisition talks from facebook in the end giphy chose to continue pursuing partnerships with various social media companies and focus on the financing the financing will go toward growth specifically hiring out more engineers and building out products api partnerships distribution partnerships and the general user base at this point in time giphy has no plans for revenue at least not any that they’ll share with me “we have a pretty big product roadmap planned for ” said coo adam leibsohn “there is lots of really cool stuff coming out like some incredible gifmaking tools we’ve learned a lot over the last year about what we need and what gif lovers need so we’re building against that knowledge base” put simply giphy is a search engine for gifs the company tags gifs to certain categories or with various keywords to make finding the perfect gif that much easier and beyond that giphy ensures that artists are credited for their works and offers distribution tools to help spread the word for example giphy launched a link shortener that automatically embeds a clickable gif into tweets instead of taking up characters with the gif link and the intended hyperlink the company launched out of betaworks in the same class as dots and poncho in april  and has since gone on to raise a  million series a alongside this recent  million series b “time and time again we’ve seen in the world of startups that if a product is defined in a single vertical that people associate the product with that vertical” said john borthwick managing partner at betaworks “google has a gif search thing somewhere but it’s one of two bazillion features on google the advantage that giphy and other vertical platforms have is that people come thinking ‘i want gifs’ they’re thinking of media type first” the team which started with about six people and has grown to  still works out of the betaworks office in ny but leibsohn says they’re currently looking for office space “the biggest challenge to us right now is… we want everyone to know love and use gifs” said leibsohn “there’s a lot to unpack in there plenty of which is challenging the easiest way to put the challenges ahead of giphy is that i want my mom to use gifs everyday”  shares advertisement advertisement crunchbase giphy founded  overview giphy is a search engine for gifs animated gifs have existed for decades but there was still no good way to browse

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf

with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
