provisions of our partnership agreement relating to cash distributions         set forth below is a summary of the significant provisions of our partnership agreement that relate to cash distributions  distributions of available cash         general     our partnership agreement requires that within  days after the end of each quarter we distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date         definition of available cash     available cash generally means for any quarter all cash on hand at the end of that quarter • less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner at the date of determination of available cash for the quarter to • provide for the proper conduct of our business including reserves for our future capital expenditures and anticipated future debt service requirements • comply with applicable law any of our debt instruments or other agreements or • provide funds for distributions to our unitholders and to our general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters provided that our general partner may not establish cash reserves for distributions unless it determines that the establishment of reserves will not prevent us from distributing the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units and any cumulative arrearages on such common units for the current quarter • plus  if our general partner so determines all or any portion of the cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made subsequent to the end of such quarter         the purpose and effect of the last bullet point above is to allow our general partner if it so decides to use cash from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter but on or before the date of determination of available cash for that quarter to pay distributions to unitholders under our partnership agreement working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under a credit facility commercial paper facility or similar financing arrangement and in all cases are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners and with the intent of the borrower to repay such borrowings within  months with funds other than from additional working capital borrowings the proceeds of working capital borrowings increase operating surplus and repayments of working capital borrowings are generally operating expenditures as described below and thus reduce operating surplus when repayments are made however if working capital borrowings which increase operating surplus are not repaid during the month period following the borrowing they will be deemed repaid at the end of such period thus decreasing operating surplus at such time when such working capital borrowings are in fact repaid they will not be treated as a further reduction in operating surplus because operating surplus will have been previously reduced by the deemed repayment         intent to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution     we intend to make a minimum quarterly distribution to the holders of our common units of  per unit or  on an annualized basis to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses including reimbursements of expenses to our general partner our most recent quarterly distribution was  per unit or  annualized however there is no guarantee that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our units in any quarter even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked the amount of distributions paid under our policy and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our general partner taking into consideration the terms of our partnership agreement      table of contents         general partner interest and incentive distribution rights     our general partner is entitled to  of all distributions that we make prior to our liquidation our general partner has the right but not the obligation to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its current general partner interest our general partners  interest in our distributions will be reduced if we issue additional units in the future and our general partner does not contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its  general partner interest         our general partner also currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive increasing percentages up to a maximum of  of the cash we distribute from operating surplus as defined below in excess of  per unit per quarter the maximum distribution of  includes distributions paid to our general partner on its  general partner interest and assumes that our general partner maintains its general partner interest at  the maximum distribution of  does not include any distributions that our general partner may receive on any common units that it owns  operating surplus and capital surplus         general     all cash distributed to unitholders will be characterized as either being paid from operating surplus or capital surplus we treat distributions of available cash from operating surplus differently than distributions of available cash from capital surplus         operating surplus     we define operating surplus as •  million as described below plus • all of our cash receipts after the closing of our initial public offering excluding cash from interim capital transactions as defined below provided that cash receipts from the termination of a commodity hedge or interest rate hedge prior to its specified termination date shall be included in operating surplus in equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life of such commodity hedge or interest rate hedge plus • working capital borrowings made after the end of a quarter but on or before the date of determination of operating surplus for that quarter plus • cash distributions including incremental distributions on incentive distribution rights paid on equity issued other than equity issued in our initial public offering to finance all or a portion of the construction acquisition development or improvement of a capital improvement or replacement of a capital asset such as equipment or facilities in respect of the period beginning on the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence the construction acquisition development or improvement of a capital improvement or replacement of a capital asset and ending on the earlier to occur of the date the capital improvement or capital asset commences commercial service and the date that it is abandoned or disposed of plus • cash distributions including incremental distributions on incentive distribution rights paid on equity issued other than equity issued in our initial public offering to pay the constructionperiod interest on debt incurred or to pay constructionperiod distributions on equity issued to finance the capital improvements or capital assets referred to above less • all of our operating expenditures as defined below after the closing of our initial public offering less • the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to provide funds for future operating expenditures less • all working capital borrowings not repaid within  months after having been incurred or repaid within such month period with the proceeds of additional working capital borrowings      table of contents         as described above operating surplus does not reflect actual cash on hand that is available for distribution to our unitholders and is not limited to cash generated by operations for example it includes a provision that will enable us if we choose to distribute as operating surplus up to  million of cash we receive in the future from nonoperating sources such as asset sales issuances of securities and longterm borrowings that would otherwise be distributed as capital surplus in addition the effect of including as described above certain cash distributions on equity interests in operating surplus is to increase operating surplus by the amount of any such cash distributions as a result we may also distribute as operating surplus up to the amount of any such cash that we receive from nonoperating sources         we define interim capital transactions as i borrowings refinancings or refundings of indebtedness other than working capital borrowings and items purchased on open account in the ordinary course of business and sales of debt securities ii sales of equity securities iii sales or other dispositions of assets other than sales or other dispositions of inventory accounts receivable and other assets in the ordinary course of business and sales or other dispositions of assets as part of ordinary course asset retirements or replacements and iv capital contributions received         we define operating expenditures as all of our cash expenditures including but not limited to taxes compensation of employees officers and directors of our general partner reimbursements of expenses to our general partner and its affiliates interest payments payments made in the ordinary course of business under interest rate hedge contracts and commodity hedge contracts provided that i with respect to amounts paid in connection with the initial purchase of an interest rate hedge contract or a commodity hedge contract such amounts will be amortized over the life of the applicable interest rate hedge contract or commodity hedge contract and ii payments made in connection with the termination of any interest rate hedge contract or commodity hedge contract prior to the expiration of its stipulated settlement or termination date will be included in operating expenditures in equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life of such interest rate hedge contract or commodity hedge contract and repayment of working capital borrowings provided however that operating expenditures do not include • repayment of working capital borrowings where such borrowings have previously been deemed to have been repaid as described above • payments including prepayments and prepayment penalties of principal of and premium on indebtedness other than working capital borrowings • expansion capital expenditures • payment of transaction expenses including but not limited to taxes relating to interim capital transactions • distributions to our partners or • repurchases of our units other than repurchases to satisfy obligations under employee benefit plans or reimbursement of expenses of our general partner for purchases of units to satisfy obligations under employee benefit plans         capital surplus     capital surplus is defined in our partnership agreement as any distribution of available cash in excess of our cumulative operating surplus accordingly except as described above capital surplus would generally be generated by • borrowings other than working capital borrowings • sales of our equity and debt securities and      table of contents • sales or other dispositions of assets other than inventory accounts receivable and other assets sold in the ordinary course of business or as part of ordinary course retirement or replacement of assets         characterization of cash distributions     our partnership agreement requires that we treat all available cash distributed as coming from operating surplus until the sum of all available cash distributed since the closing of our initial public offering equals the operating surplus from the closing of our initial public offering through the end of the quarter immediately preceding that distribution our partnership agreement requires that we treat any amount distributed in excess of operating surplus regardless of its source as capital surplus we do not anticipate that we will make any distributions from capital surplus  capital expenditures         maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures including expenditures for the addition or improvement to or the replacement of our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing or the construction or development of new capital assets made to maintain our operating income or operating capacity over the long term we expect that a primary component of maintenance capital expenditures will include expenditures to connect additional wells to our gathering systems to offset natural declines in production over time and for routine equipment and pipeline maintenance or replacement due to age or obsolescence         expansion capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term expansion capital expenditures include interest payments and related fees on debt incurred and issued to finance the construction of such capital improvement and paid in respect of the period beginning on the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence construction of the capital improvement and ending on the earlier to occur of the date that such capital improvement commences commercial service and the date that such capital improvement is abandoned or disposed of examples of expansion capital expenditures include the acquisition of equipment or the construction development or acquisition of additional pipeline or treating capacity or new compression capacity to the extent such capital expenditures are expected to expand our longterm operating capacity or operating income         capital expenditures that are made in part for maintenance capital purposes and in part for expansion capital purposes will be allocated between maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures by our general partner  distributions of available cash from operating surplus         we will make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for each quarter in the following manner • first  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until we distribute for each outstanding unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter and • thereafter in the manner described in —general partner interest and incentive distribution rights below         the preceding discussion is based on the assumptions that our general partner maintains its  general partner interest and that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities      table of contents  general partner interest and incentive distribution rights         our general partner is currently entitled to  of all distributions that we make prior to our liquidation our general partner has the right but not the obligation to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us in order to maintain its  general partner interest if we issue additional units our general partners  interest and the percentage of our cash distributions to which it is entitled from such  interest will be proportionately reduced if we issue additional units in the future other than the issuance of common units upon a reset of the incentive distribution rights and our general partner does not contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us in order to maintain its  general partner interest our partnership agreement does not require that our general partner fund its capital contribution with cash it may instead fund its capital contribution by the contribution to us of common units or other property         incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage   and  of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved our general partner currently holds the incentive distribution rights but may transfer these rights separately from its general partner interest at any time without the approval of any person         the following discussion assumes that our general partner maintains its  general partner interest and that our general partner continues to own the incentive distribution rights         if for any quarter we have distributed available cash from operating surplus to the common unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution then we will distribute any additional available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders and the general partner in the following manner • first  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until each unitholder receives a total of  per unit for that quarter the first target distribution • second  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until each unitholder receives a total of  per unit for that quarter the second target distribution • third  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until each unitholder receives a total of  per unit for that quarter the third target distribution and • thereafter  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner  percentage allocations of available cash from operating surplus         the following table illustrates the percentage allocations of available cash from operating surplus between the unitholders and our general partner based on the specified target distribution levels the amounts set forth under marginal percentage interest in distributions are the percentage interests of our general partner and the unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the column total quarterly distribution per unit target amount the percentage interests shown for our unitholders and our general partner for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution the percentage interests set forth below for our general partner include its  general partner interest and assume that our general partner has contributed any      table of contents additional capital necessary to maintain its  general partner interest and our general partner has not transferred its incentive distribution rights

     first target distribution    up to            second target distribution   above  up to            third target distribution   above  up to            thereafter   above             general partners right to reset incentive distribution levels         our general partner as the initial holder of our incentive distribution rights has the right under our partnership agreement to elect to relinquish the right to receive incentive distribution payments based on the initial target distribution levels and to reset at higher levels the minimum quarterly distribution amount and target distribution levels upon which the incentive distribution payments to our general partner would be set if our general partner transfers all or a portion of our incentive distribution rights in the future then the holder or holders of a majority of our incentive distribution rights will be entitled to exercise this right the following discussion assumes that our general partner holds all of the incentive distribution rights at the time that a reset election is made our general partners right to reset the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels upon which the incentive distributions payable to our general partner are based may be exercised without approval of our unitholders or the conflicts committee of our general partner at any time when we have made cash distributions to the holders of the incentive distribution rights at the highest level of incentive distribution for each of the four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding such time and the amount of each such distribution did not exceed adjusted operating surplus for such quarter respectively if our general partner and its affiliates are not the holders of a majority of the incentive distribution rights at the time an election is made to reset the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels then the proposed reset will be subject to the prior written concurrence of the general partner that the conditions described above have been satisfied the reset minimum quarterly distribution amount and target distribution levels will be higher than the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels prior to the reset such that our general partner will not receive any incentive distributions under the reset target distribution levels until cash distributions per unit following this event increase as described below we anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would otherwise not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit taking into account the existing levels of incentive distribution payments being made to our general partner         in connection with the resetting of the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels and the corresponding relinquishment by our general partner of incentive distribution payments based on the target distributions prior to the reset our general partner will be entitled to receive a number of newly issued common units and general partner units based on a predetermined formula described below that takes into account the cash parity value of the average cash distributions related to the incentive distribution rights received by our general partner for the two quarters immediately preceding the reset event as compared to the average cash distributions per common unit during that twoquarter period our general partner will be issued the number of general partner units necessary to maintain our general partners interest in us immediately prior to the reset election         the number of common units that our general partner would be entitled to receive from us in connection with a resetting of the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution      table of contents levels then in effect would be equal to the quotient determined by dividing x the average aggregate amount of cash distributions received by our general partner in respect of its incentive distribution rights during the two consecutive fiscal quarters ended immediately prior to the date of such reset election by y the average of the aggregate amount of cash distributed per common unit during each of these two quarters         following a reset election the minimum quarterly distribution amount will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution amount per unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election which amount we refer to as the reset minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reset to be correspondingly higher such that we would distribute all of our available cash from operating surplus for each quarter thereafter as follows • first  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until each unitholder receives an amount per unit equal to  of the reset minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter • second  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until each unitholder receives an amount per unit equal to  of the reset minimum quarterly distribution for the quarter • third  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until each unitholder receives an amount per unit equal to  of the reset minimum quarterly distribution for the quarter and • thereafter  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner  distributions from capital surplus         how distributions from capital surplus will be made     we will make distributions of available cash from capital surplus if any in the following manner • first  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until we distribute for each common unit that was issued in our initial public offering an amount of available cash from capital surplus equal to the initial public offering price of our initial public offering and • thereafter as if they were distributions from operating surplus         the preceding discussion is based on the assumption that our general partner maintains its  general partner interest and that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities         effect of a distribution from capital surplus     our partnership agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the initial unit price from our initial public offering which is a return of capital the initial public offering price less any distributions of capital surplus per unit is referred to as the unrecovered initial unit price each time a distribution of capital surplus is made the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced in the same proportion as the corresponding reduction in the unrecovered initial unit price because distributions of capital surplus will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels after any of these distributions are made it may be easier for our general partner to receive incentive distributions however any distribution of capital surplus before the unrecovered initial unit price is reduced to zero cannot be applied to the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution         once we distribute capital surplus on a unit issued in our initial public offering in an amount equal to the initial unit price we will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to zero we will then make all future distributions from operating surplus with  being paid to the unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner the percentage interests shown for our general partner include its  general partner interest and assume that our general partner has not transferred the incentive distribution rights      table of contents  adjustment to the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels         in addition to adjusting the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels to reflect a distribution of capital surplus if we combine our units into fewer units or subdivide our units into a greater number of units we will proportionately adjust • the minimum quarterly distribution • the target distribution levels • the unrecovered initial unit price • the number of general partner units comprising the general partner interest and • the per unit arrearage in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units         for example if a twoforone split of the common units should occur the minimum quarterly distribution the target distribution levels and the unrecovered initial unit price would each be reduced to  of its initial level we will not make any adjustment by reason of the issuance of additional units for cash or property         in addition if legislation is enacted or if existing law is modified or interpreted by a governmental authority so that we become taxable as a corporation or otherwise subject to taxation as an entity for federal state or local income tax purposes our partnership agreement specifies that the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels for each quarter may be reduced by multiplying each distribution level by a fraction the numerator of which is available cash for that quarter reduced by the amount of the estimated tax liability for such quarter payable by reason of such legislation or interpretation and the denominator of which is the sum of available cash for that quarter reduced by the amount of the estimated tax liability for such quarter payable by reason of such legislation or interpretation plus our general partners estimate of our aggregate liability for the quarter for such income taxes payable by reason of such legislation or interpretation to the extent that the actual tax liability differs from the estimated tax liability for any quarter the difference will be accounted for in subsequent quarters  distributions of cash upon liquidation         general     if we dissolve in accordance with our partnership agreement we will sell or otherwise dispose of our assets in a process called liquidation we will first apply the proceeds of liquidation to the payment of our creditors we will distribute any remaining proceeds to the unitholders and our general partner in accordance with their capital account balances as adjusted to reflect any gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of our assets in liquidation         manner of adjustments for gain     the manner of the adjustment for gain is set forth in our partnership agreement we will allocate any gain to our partners in the following manner • first to our general partner and the holders of units who have negative balances in their capital accounts to the extent of and in proportion to those negative balances • second   to the common unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until the capital account for each common unit is equal to the sum of  the unrecovered initial unit price and  the amount of the minimum quarterly distribution for the quarter during which our liquidation occurs • third   to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until we allocate under this paragraph an amount per unit equal to  the sum of the excess of the first target distribution per unit over the minimum quarterly distribution per unit for each quarter of our existence less  the cumulative amount per unit of any distributions of available cash from      table of contents operating surplus in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution per unit that we distributed  to the unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner for each quarter of our existence • fourth  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until we allocate under this paragraph an amount per unit equal to  the sum of the excess of the second target distribution per unit over the first target distribution per unit for each quarter of our existence less  the cumulative amount per unit of any distributions of available cash from operating surplus in excess of the first target distribution per unit that we distributed  to the unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner for each quarter of our existence • fifth  to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner until we allocate under this paragraph an amount per unit equal to  the sum of the excess of the third target distribution per unit over the second target distribution per unit for each quarter of our existence less  the cumulative amount per unit of any distributions of available cash from operating surplus in excess of the second target distribution per unit that we distributed  to the unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner for each quarter of our existence and • thereafter   to all unitholders pro rata and  to our general partner         the percentages set forth above are based on the assumption that our general partner has not transferred its incentive distribution rights and that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities         manner of adjustments for losses     after making allocations of loss to the general partner and the unitholders in a manner intended to offset in reverse order the allocations of gains that have previously been allocated we will generally allocate any loss to our general partner and the unitholders in the following manner • first  to the holders of common units in proportion to the positive balances in their capital accounts and  to our general partner until the capital accounts of the common unitholders have been reduced to zero and • thereafter   to our general partner         adjustments to capital accounts     our partnership agreement requires that we make adjustments to capital accounts upon the issuance of additional units in this regard our partnership agreement specifies that we allocate any unrealized and for tax purposes unrecognized gain resulting from the adjustments to the unitholders and the general partner in the same manner as we allocate gain upon liquidation in the event that we make positive adjustments to the capital accounts upon the issuance of additional units our partnership agreement requires that we generally allocate any later negative adjustments to the capital accounts resulting from the issuance of additional units or upon our liquidation in a manner which results to the extent possible in the partners capital account balances equaling the amount which they would have been if no earlier positive adjustments to the capital accounts had been made in contrast to the allocations of gain and except as provided above we generally will allocate any unrealized and unrecognized loss resulting from the adjustments to capital accounts upon the issuance of additional units to the unitholders and our general partner based on their respective percentage ownership of us if we make negative adjustments to the capital accounts as a result of such loss future positive adjustments resulting from the issuance of additional units will be allocated in a manner designed to reverse the prior negative adjustments and special allocations will be made upon liquidation in a manner that results to the extent possible in our unitholders capital account balances equaling the amounts they would have been if no earlier adjustments for loss had been made      table of contents   the partnership agreement         the following is a summary of the material provisions of our partnership agreement we will

limited subject to possible exceptions to the amount of capital it is obligated to contribute to us for its common units plus its share of any undistributed profits and assets if it were determined however that the right of or exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group • to remove or replace our general partner • to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or • to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business for the purposes of the delaware act then the limited partners could be held personally liable for our obligations under the laws of delaware to the same extent as our general partner this liability would extend to persons who transact business with us who reasonably believe that a limited partner is a general partner neither our partnership agreement nor the delaware act specifically provides for legal recourse against our general partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of our general partner while this does not mean that a limited partner could not seek legal recourse we know of no precedent for such a claim in delaware case law         under the delaware act a limited partnership may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all liabilities of the limited partnership other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited partnership except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited is included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability for the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a limited partnership the delaware act provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the nonrecourse liability the delaware act provides that a limited partner who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the delaware act shall be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years under the delaware act a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of its

company conducts business including qualifying our subsidiaries to do business there         limitations on the liability of members or limited partners for the obligations of a limited liability company or limited partnership have not been clearly established in many jurisdictions if by virtue of our ownership interest in our operating company or otherwise it were determined that we were conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership or limited liability company statute or that the right or exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group to remove or replace our general partner to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business for purposes of the statutes of any relevant jurisdiction then the limited partners could be      table of contents held personally liable for our obligations under the law of that

of capital to us to maintain its  general partner interest moreover our general partner has the right which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its affiliates to purchase
