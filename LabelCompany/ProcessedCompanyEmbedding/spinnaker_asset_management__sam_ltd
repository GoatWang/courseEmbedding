the industry known as iq technology® this integrated and proprietary process results in sail shapes that are fast efficient and infinitely repeatablea feat no other sailmaker can match better boat handling with a better sail shape fusion m™ sails are engineered as fullsize membranes and designed with a fullyintegrated custom fiber network that addresses sail loading in all directions rather than along primary load paths only to achieve the ideal shape quantum’s sail designers use proprietary computational tools part of the iq technology® suite to create custom shaping tailored on a sailbysail basis the resulting sail shape lasts longer and is easy to trim through a wide range of conditions longevity  repeatability our twostep lamination process results in a superior membrane that delivers a longer life compared to laminates made by singlestep methods sail panels are completely cured before the shaping process begins eliminating the effects of shrinkage and guaranteeing

coupling infrared heat intense pressure crosslinked molecular structure postcured shaping aero structural coupling designing the ideal flying shape sail shape using our own d design program actual boat specifications and our extensive database of boat and sail types the size and geometry of the sail are defined and a mold shape created sophisticated editing tools allow for the highest levels of accuracy and refinement aerodynamic analysis using a virtual prototype of the sail shape and computational fluid dynamic cfd calculations designers compute and visualize aerodynamic forces wind angles and velocities and the distribution of air pressure on each side of the sail the resulting images and data help predict performance structural analysis and fiber mapping using finite element analysis fea quantum designers visualize where the sail bends and twists and the distribution of stress and strain within the membrane the virtual sail is attached to a rig model that takes into account the properties of the running and standing rigging and longitudinal and transverse stiffness data gained through inhouse materials testing is added to the equation to evaluate the effects of different fiber types amounts and placement leading to the development of a custom fiber map the integration of d modeling cfd and fea fluid structures interaction allows designers to assess and refine varying elements of the sail design leading ultimately to the optimal size shape structure fiber type and fiber layout of the finished product quantum’s expertise in using these tools is particularly valuable when applied to large sailing yachts which present unique challenges due to variable weight placement and heavy loads infrared heat to create the laminate fibers are strung on the base film in a custom pattern according to the design specifications during application excess glue is stripped from the fibers to avoid saturation minimize brittleness and to achieve the highest strength to weight ratio after the top layer of film is in place a vacuum bagging process is used to “shrink wrap” the film around the fibers the layers are then fused using infrared heat quantum’s carbon infrared emitter system is a quick and efficient heat source that is easily controllable to ensure that just the right amount of heat is applied during the laminating process depending upon the type and amount of materials being used in your sail to fabricate modern composites infrared heat or uv radiation is used because they quickly and homogeneously heat or cure them it also transfers heat directly and precisely without having to contact the laminate and damage the components and can be used in the vacuum conditions quantum uses during lamination intense pressure quantum uses twopart thermoset adhesives which require high heat and pressure for lamination compared to simple thermomolded adhesives several tons of pressure are applied to the vacuumbagged laminate to ensure the adhesive is evenly spread this proprietary process squeezes the adhesive down to the thinnest possible layer and ensures the highest possible adhesive to fiber ratio crosslinked molecular structure the thermoset adhesives used in fusion m™ sails undergo a transformation at the molecular level during lamination the high heat and intense pressure induce polymerization—the creation of a cross linked molecular structure as the two part adhesive “kicks” the result is a laminate with  times the sheer strength of a traditional hotmelt thermomolded method postcured shaping unlike singlestep lamination and shaping methods used by other sailmakers sections of a quantum® fusion m™ sail are completely cured before the shaping process begins this process eliminates the effects of shrinkage and distortion under the heat of the lamination process and guarantees repeatability the carefully optimized aerodynamic shape of a quantum® sail is reliably provided to each and every client every time sail
