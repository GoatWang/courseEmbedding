strove for early excellence promoted sound investment philosophy modeled role of success sources in a mere ten years princeton graduate mellody hobson rose from intern to president of chicagobased ariel capital management an investment firm catering to the needs of africanamerican investors for a time ariel was the first and only minorityowned investment firm offering public mutual funds as a top executive for one of the few africanamerican owned investment companies in the nation hobson has had the opportunity to address the needs of africanamerican investors as the africanamerican middle class has grown so have the number of africanamerican investors while many of these investors use such vehicles as bonds securities and real estate hobson viewed stocks as the best vehicle to grow significant wealth this is the message that she has taken to the black community since she began her career with ariel hobson told robert kurson of esquire “my dream is of seeing black grandmothers in their bathing suits at the beach retired comfortably my dream is that the beach is their option” strove for early excellence the daughter of a single mother who worked as a realestate agent hobson grew up in downtown chicago she was the youngest of six children though by her own admission she felt like an only child because her oldest sibling was  years older than she and the youngest was nine years older “in a way i’m an only child” she recalled in an article for the new york times “i had five moms all the time whatever they told me to do i had to do” at st ignatius college preparatory school in chicago the hardworking hobson earned top grades and was as she told sandra block of usa today “neurotic about school—i was beyond obsessed i used to cry if i couldn’t go to school” as she prepared to graduate from high school hobson found herself courted by ivy league bastions harvard university and princeton university though she had originally planned to attend harvard she finally opted for princeton where she began working toward a degree in mathematics after considering what her career options would be with a mathematics degree however she transferred to the woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs at princeton there she majored in south african studies while working on her senior thesis for princeton in  she traveled to south africa where by chance she

which was run by another princeton graduate john w rogers jr “that experience convinced me that was where my future would be” she reflected in black collegian online after graduating in  she briefly considered pursuing a career in journalism before deciding to join ariel she knew almost immediately that she had made the right choice “my first day of work john rogers told me not to let titles get in the way of good ideas and don’t be afraid to say what you think” she recalled in honey magazine it wasn’t long before hobson put one of her own ideas to good use while she was the vice president and director of marketing for the company she oversaw client services and participated in strategic planning hobson realized that while investment companies had until then conducted surveys to pinpoint the practices and needs of investors by age and gender such surveys had not been used to ascertain information by race a frustrated hobson began to wonder how she could market products to african americans without this data so in  she launched an annual survey of africanamerican investors which later became a joint effort with wall street broker charles schwab promoted sound investment philosophy it is no coincidence that ariel adopted the tortoise as their company logo longterm investment is crucial when it comes to accruing wealth in the stock market and as mutual fund managers come ariel has a relatively conservative investment philosophy hobson has had fun with the tortoise theme decorating the corporate offices and her private office with visions of this mascot “i wanted the collection to be eclectic and fun” she told the wall street journal’s nancy d holt yet the tortoises which range from whimsical to serious artworks act as a subtle reminder of the company’s strategy of slow and steady growth in wealth for its clients and in its growth as a business “i’m always factoring in a worstcase scenario” hobson told chicago business “people call me a ‘depression baby’” not someone born during the great depression—she is too young for that—but someone who grew up in lake point tower in downtown chicago in  ariel’s managers decided to break away from the calvert group and market ariel’s three mutual funds directly although assets at first plunged by  to  million by  they had more than doubled to  million to get her message across hobson used many avenues she speaks at events around the country and she has offered tenweek courses on investing—one of which attracted  students she is a regular financial contributor to abc network’s good morning america and reports on finances for wgn’s minority business report after a decade she has seen the number of africanamerican stockholders rise yet she still continued striving to make the stock market common dinner table conversation in black households across america “i’m heartened by these stock ownership trends” she was quoted as saying in knightridder tribune business news “i’m very pleased with the progress our community is making we are beginning to recognize the power of compounding through stock market investing” even so for hobson there is always more to be done about getting the word out hobson commented in the atlanta journalconstitution “the media are making a big difference but there are a few things that still need to be done one is that investing should be taught in schools it amazes me that we have courses in auto repair but not investing” to support the development of future investors the company created and financially supported the ariel community academy as part of the curriculum at the chosen innercity chicago public school the firstgrade class is given  to invest over the course of their elementary education the students are taught to invest they study all kinds of investments and by sixth grade they manage  of the fund at the end of the eighth grade the students give  to the incoming firstgrade class while the investment profits are used to fund academic scholarships and make charitable donations modeled role of success in  hobson became president of ariel as president she oversaw the company’s dealings with corporate public and nonprofit institutions she also directed the firm’s marketing and strategy plans it has taken some time for her and for others to become accustomed to her soaring success as a highprofile person who is rich in her own right she is breaking down racial barriers by her mere presence hobson noted that she can go for days without seeing another person of color in a senior position she explained in pr newswire “people come into my office all the time where i’m the president of the firm and they give me their coat and ask me for coffee because they don’t know who i am so i hang up the coat get the coffee and then sit at the head of the table” because she believes that hard work and success go hand in hand hobson clocked long weeks leading by example “i’m not a big believer in assuming attributes that don’t come naturally” she told chicago tribune reporter carol kleiman “the most effective leaders have a strong sense of self that is not shaped by conventional wisdom” for hobson combining the traits of a woman as well as a businessperson have made her a successful executive “women should be strong but not tough and kind but not soft i think that’s something that took us a while to figure out” she added hobson has given back to the chicago community in many ways serving on the boards of charitable and community organizations including the chicago public library and the princeton and st ignatius

emailfacebooktwittermellody hobson with her daughter everest at ariel investments in chicago “shes not a networker” says economist and author dambisa moyo “shes a magnet”photograph by annie leibovitzmellody hobson has a long list of prominent fans whose adoration of her borders on adulation“she has a grace and graciousness about her that is singular” jeffrey katzenberg the ceo of dreamworks animation tells me “she is remarkably unique she’s a stunning person i get a little nervous talking about her because the words are so flowery but it’s truly how i feel about her”sheryl sandberg the facebook chief operating officer who first met hobson some five years ago because they were both board members at eve ensler’s vday organization which combats violence against women credits a comment hobson made with inspiring her to write her bestseller lean in “she said she wanted to be unapologetically black and unapologetically a woman” sandberg says recalling that the comment helped her move past trying to make her gender difference fade into the background “my life was altered by meeting her and that’s not something i say lightly” sandberg adds “she is such a big part of my path taken i think she does that for everyone”“what can i say” says howard schultz the chairman and ceo of starbucks “when i think of her i think of grace she’s the most unique individual i love mellody hobson”“payne stewart had wwjd what would jesus do” dambisa moyo the oxford and harvardtrained economist and author tells me “i have wwmd”george lucas and hobson on their wedding day june    donna newman photographyhobson is the president of a wellrespected chicago moneymanagement firm called ariel investments she’s a board member at estée lauder starbucks where she chairs the auditandcompliance committee and dreamworks animation where she chairs the entire board for many years she was a contributor to abc’s good morning america she now works for cbs news and is on the boards of too many philanthropic organizations to list and while she’s not a household name—at least not yet—she is at the hub of an eclectic group of people who arein june  hobson who is  married george lucas the yearold filmmaker who sold his company lucasfilm to walt disney in  for more than  billion in august the couple welcomed a daughter everest hobson lucas who was born via gestational surrogate to the world lucas had adopted three children previously amanda kate and jett all now young adults last june lucas announced that the lucas museum of narrative art which will showcase “moving images—from illustration to cinema to the digital media of the future” would be built in chicago although the project has faced controversy with the chicago tribune comparing aspects of the design to jabba the hutt and lucas now saying he may be forced to take it elsewhere the potential change to the lakefront is a monument to hobson’s influence—and that she can exert that kind of influence is no surprise to those who know her including another longtime friend and fan chicago mayor rahm emanuel “on one level it is shocking it does surprise you but then you know mellody and it’s not surprising at all” he saysbecause here’s the thing about hobson’s remarkable life and all of this extravagant praise it is earnedariel’s offices in chicago’s aon center building are on the th floor where the light reflected from lake michigan illuminates the serene space one conference room is named for warren buffett whose investing style ariel emulates in it there’s a picture of buffett with hobson and john rogers ariel’s ceo who has been hobson’s boss mentor and partner for some  years along one hallway there are pictures of president obama who worked out of ariel’s offices in  when his permanent offices were being established there are lots of tortoises because the tortoise in aesop’s fable is the slow and steady one who wins the race and that’s ariel’s style and there are hourglasses which hobson says demonstrate the firm’s thoughtfulness about how time is used to help hobson manage her time the firm turned a conference room adjoining her office into a nursery for everestone morning she’s wearing a fitted black flowered dolce  gabbana dress accented with a pink lucite collar that she describes as a “cheapie” from ikram the chicago boutique run by her longtime friend ikram goldman ikram describes hobson’s distinctive style as “fearless” she’s also wearing a sleek black jawbone which documents that she got out of bed at  am and was exercising by  am but hobson pulls out her phone to show me that that’s not quite accurate she was actually sending emails by  am this is standard for her even though hobson who runs all parts of the firm outside of research and investing travels constantly “george says flying is the new smoking” she tells me “we will look back and say ‘oh why did we do this to ourselves’ but where my clients are i go”dick parsons the former head of time warner who is another longtime friend and admirer describes hobson as having a pixielike quality and with her wide brown eyes and cropped hair she does but in person she is also regal she punctuates her stories with a hearty laugh that is genuine but not spontaneous there is a formality to her she can be warm but there’s a cool watchful quality about her that can turn steely she is the definition of a doer “when people look at all the things i do they say it’s overwhelming but i don’t feel overwhelmed” she says “i get it done i’m very organized and it’s all tied together”hobson’s commitment to work is one of her signature traits “the one thing i knew i could do is outwork everyone” she likes to say a college roommate at princeton ann davis vaughan who is a former wall street journal reporter and now runs her own research firm says that she and her husband visited hobson at her chicago apartment on the day of her and lucas’s wedding party hobson chatted with them for  minutes or so—and then excused herself to go to the office because she hadn’t yet finished ariel’s quarterly letter to investors “she literally went to the office on the afternoon of her own wedding party” says vaughanivyboundif hobson’s life seems ridiculously charmed she wasn’t born in a place that made that inevitable or even likely she is the youngest child of a single mother dorothy ashley who had mellody more than two decades after the birth of her first child hobson’s father was not present in her life “dorth” as hobson sometimes called her mother was a hardworking entrepreneur who fixed up and rented out and later sold condominiums she passed away last year but she didn’t have a hard enough heart to be a good businesswoman she couldn’t evict people who couldn’t pay their rent recalls hobson’s sister pat hamel and when she began selling condos she was often penalized by redlining that plus her own extravagance—both sisters recall their mother buying easter dresses instead of paying the phone bill—resulted in frequent evictions and moves between chicago’s relatively wealthier north side and the grittier south side where they’d sometimes heat water for baths on hot plates “even though i will never be evicted again i am haunted by those times and still work relentlessly” hobson wrote in her chapter in sandberg’s lean in for graduates “when i think of my career and why i leaned in it comes down to basic survival”dorothy ashley was a strange mixture of “brutal pragmatism and optimism” says hobson who remembers returning at the age of seven from a birthday party where she was the only black child “how did they treat you” her mother asked “because they won’t always treat you well” but her mother also instilled in her daughter both confidence and independence “my mom would say ‘you have a birthday party to go to well you can’t go unless you’ve planned how to get there and how to get a present’ she wouldn’t do that for me i found my own orthodontist my own high school i set up interviews and did college trips despite her incredible concern and caring my mom didn’t have the capacity for that it was outside her experience and she knew i was on top of it” says hobsonwarren buffett and hobson “mellody made the decisions for her whole life” says hamel who also remembers that her sister never got a spanking and that her family always believed she would be successful “she knew what she wanted to do and how she wanted to do it” hamel also says that hobson was “very very thoughtful about her future and about the kind of people she allowed in her life”in high school at chicago’s saint ignatius hobson recalls she was a “joiner” “i wasn’t with the cool kids but i could be” she says “i was accepted” her friend peter thompson a selfdescribed jock whose grandfather is richard j daley the former longtime mayor of chicago says that while hobson was more of a nerd in school he got to know her on a retreat “what’s notable about mellody is that she’s always one of the more earnest people in the room” he sayshobson does not try to hide the fact that she tries her fifthgrade teacher miss falbo would record weekly spelling tests by having students score their neighbor’s exam and read the grade aloud “if everyone got  percent then each person in the entire class would get two girl scout cookies” hobson remembers “but if one person missed there would be no cookies for anyone” and the words were like “concatenation” she pauses in her story to define the word for me the linking of events in a chain then she recalls the moment miss falbo said “ ‘hobson  percent’ i missed a word i’m mortified i’m praying i need someone else to miss or i’m toast at recess they get to the last person alphabetically adam yaseen and no one else has missed miss falbo looks at me ‘hobson i’m not going to punish the whole class because of your incompetence’ she says ‘you can step into the hallway while we enjoy our girl scout cookies’ the door was  feet away and i’m thinking to myself don’t cry don’t cry i’m looking into the room through the glass door at everyone eating their girl scout cookies and i say to myself ‘never again i will never ever fail at something related to school ever again’ it unleashed my obsession”her stellar academic record attracted offers from top colleges including harvard she was going to go there but decided at the last minute on princeton instead that decision began with a recruiter john rogers who is  years older than hobson and who founded ariel when he was just  rogers had attended princeton where he played basketball with craig robinson michelle obama’s brother his parents john rogers sr who was a tuskegee airman and jewel lafontant met the first day of law school at the university of chicago where she was the first africanamerican female graduate she also became the first female deputy solicitor general of the united statesrogers’s father sparked his interest in the stock market by giving him stock certificates in lieu of toys starting when he was  after working as a stockbroker for a few years he raised money from friends and family—including from the parents of future obama presidential adviser valerie jarrett who were neighbors—and launched ariel “i grew up in a world where a strong dynamic woman could achieve anything” says rogers today “and when i saw mellody i saw this bright brilliant person who could indeed achieve anything”through rogers hobson was invited to a business persons’ breakfast with basketball great bill bradley then a us senator from new jersey it was the beginning of a remarkably formative friendship “we started talking and i don’t remember the name of one other person at the breakfast” says bradley todaythat moment highlights another of hobson’s gifts “someone once told me that the secret to success is being the person who other people want to see succeed” says parsons “it’s more important than talent brains or luck and mellody is the person others want to see succeed”to her friends in college hobson seemed like a normal kid but she was preternaturally aware in a letter to her sister pat at the start of freshman year she talked about her “incredible day” spent volunteering at a princeton nursing home “it really made me think about how scary it is to age especially for mommie and how unfair we as americans are to the people who raised us and who have practically built this country by hand” she wrote she added “talking with the elderly also does wonders for my communication skills” and she wrote this to her sister who had helped raise her “although i don’t have much yet what i do have is yours”after college she returned to ariel where she had done a summer internship “i was desperate to understand money desperate for financial security” says hobson “i felt like financial security would be the biggest gift i could ever have ever” she became an unofficial chief of staff to rogers a role in which she’d challenge herself by seeing if she could anticipate his answer—and then by seeing if she had a better one in  rogers who oversees the investing side of the business named her president she hustled laurence kandel a vice president at obermeyer asset management in colorado says he’d see her on the sales circuit drumming up business “she’s at things i wouldn’t expect things where she is by far the most senior person in the room and she’s there doing the handtohand combat” he sayshobson also became both politically and philanthropically engaged at a remarkably early age in the mids she and rogers founded ariel community academy a public school on the south side of chicago that includes course work on financial literacy in  ariel launched the black corporate directors conference to bring together board members from fortune  companies hobson was an early supporter of barack obama’s and in  she helped with bradley’s presidential run “even when mellody was really young people would say ‘i see this woman everywhere’ ” says peter thompson whose aunt maggie daley also became close to hobson “she started cracking this scene early on”the bradley campaign also helped hobson formulate her life’s motto she remembers a fundraising trip to st louis with louis susman the former us ambassador to the uk “i said ‘lou what do you want’ he said ‘i want to have an interesting life and be surrounded by good people’ i said ‘that’s it’ i added a third one to leave the world a better place” she says though that this has caused her some cognitive dissonance “a coach at ariel said to me ‘mellody everyone doesn’t want what you want’ this was shocking to me it took me a long time to work through it i thought not everyone wants to be around interesting people no some people want to have two weeks’ vacation and to go home at five pm”but it is ariel that has been the anchor in her life she likes to note that she’s been told she is the only person from her class at princeton who has had the same work number since graduation through stock grants as well as purchases she’s made some by borrowing money when she was only in her s hobson has become a significant shareholder in ariel—a stake that is worth tens of millions of dollarswhich helps explain why the financial crisis of  was such a difficult time for her the firm had sailed through the dotcom crash delivering aboveaverage returns to investors but in the  financial crisis the stocks it owned were some of the hardesthit—and hobson had met an obstacle she couldn’t outwork ariel’s flagship fund fell almost  percent that year and clients began pulling their money the firm’s assets under management peaked at  billion in  and fell to just  billion in  “every single day clients would call and fire us” hobson says “people who you’d known for years and years it felt so personal” she and rogers had to lay off  percent of the person staff “john was asking ‘shouldn’t the product be better’ ” says hobson “i was saying ‘i haven’t explained it well to clients i didn’t do a good job’ we both owned it”hobson early in her career  stuart rodgers photographyearly one morning during the crisis global markets were plunging hobson doesn’t usually focus on daytoday fluctuations but this day she was staring at the tv hyperventilating she and lucas always talk at  am chicago time when they’re in different cities “george said ‘what do you know better than anyone else because you live in chicago’ ” she recalls “i said ‘george i have no idea i’m not interested in mind games’ he said ‘the one thing you have in chicago is snowstorms what do you know about snowstorms in a snowstorm when you’re trying to get from one place to another place you never look up at the storm you watch your feet if you look up at the storm you will fall’ ” hobson says “i went to work and thought we must stay focused and watch our feet we must just do the work”ariel got through the crisis partly because hobson and rogers had left capital in the firm instead of paying it to themselves and partly because they didn’t change their investing style although morningstar analyst kevin mcdevitt points out that the crisis has dented ariel’s longterm record since then the firm’s main fund has dramatically outperformed the market assets under management have risen to  billion “postcrisis being privately owned allowed them to stick to their knitting and both owners and clients benefited in the end” says bill lee the chief investment officer at kaiser permanente who has given ariel money to manage he adds “when you see the intensity of the work ethic from the owners you know they are still building their business and don’t have to worry about them calling in rich”ariel isn’t yet where either rogers or hobson wants it to be “we are still david” rogers says “we are proud of what we’ve done for  years but we are the little guys we want to be a major moneymanagement firm” he continues “there have been breakthroughs in other areas but not in the financial world when it comes to being taken seriously in the parts of the world where wealth and power are being created today i do not think there are other mellodys”hollywood endingmellody hobson was one of the lowerprofile people at her own wedding she and lucas who met in  were married in the summer of  at lucas’s skywalker ranch which is just outside san francisco bill bradley walked hobson down the aisle and journalist bill moyers officiated “i recognized almost everyone there” says thompson and indeed the guest list included steven spielberg oprah winfrey samuel l jackson and harrison ford according to people magazine then the couple had a larger party at chicago’s promontory point which offers the city’s best view of lake michigan that ceremony featured a performance by prince“i’ve known george a long time and i’ve never seen him this happy including the night that star wars opened” says david geffen who is another of hobson’s fans “i love her” he sayshobson and lucas’s is not a relationship that is obvious to outsiders and some of her friends were at first concerned “we were sitting on the couch with our shoes off when she told me george had invited her to another dinner” recalls arianna huffington who first met hobson in the early s on the board of do something an organization that promotes social change “i said ‘you can’t go’ i thought he was a ladies’ man” lucas and his first wife film editor marcia lou griffin divorced in and yet huffington adds there’s a “kismet” to their relationship at their wedding hobson made a comment that surprised her friend joshua cooper ramo the journalist turned vicechairman of kissinger associates she said that as unlikely as it might seem she and george were the same person when lucas was in his late teens thinking he’d be a racecar driver he had a terrible accident resulting in a long hospital stay he would go on to make american graffiti ramo likens that to the one moment when hobson met bill bradley “they both had a moment when the panorama around them adjusted radically” he says “and they both responded similarly”‘these are two hugely serious people” says leigh bienen a criminaldefense lawyer who is a senior lecturer at northwestern she and hobson first met when mellody was a student and bienen was teaching at princeton’s woodrow wilson school “they are not kids probably mellody was never a kid in the sense of being carefree and careless and perhaps george wasn’t either” she adds “they are both people who for very good reasons do not have low opinions of themselves they are not mockhumble you never feel arrogance you never see unkindness but there is a glinty eye there they are not fools and they are not fooled by anyone the other side of the coin is that they both recognize and respect other serious people”when i ask hobson what makes the relationship work she says “we have the same values star wars was written for yearold boys to teach them right and wrong” she adds “by values i mean what’s right and what society expects of us”she and lucas who has signed the giving pledge—created by warren buffett and bill and melinda gates—committing himself to giving away half his fortune before or upon his death have already given  million to the university of chicago laboratory schools to support the construction of an arts building and have announced that they will give another  million over five years to a chicago nonprofit called after school matters which was founded by late chicago first lady maggie daley and where hobson is chairmanlucas hobson and everest may  from gertrude  mabel photography hobson says that their shared values are also about normalcy “george says to me ‘we are normal’ and we are we go to movies every weekend he likes to have the same experience that others do so we don’t watch in a screening room closed off to the world we go to the local theater in whatever city we are in” she tells me about one friday night when they ate at sizzlereven so hobson’s life is not exactly what one would call normal at one prewedding party she seated howard schultz with another longtime friend oprah winfrey “we got into a whole discussion about tea” schultz recalls “one thing led to another—and that was the beginning of the creation of teavana oprah chai tea” which starbucks launched in april on the surface hobson’s circle of friends has the slightly artificial feeling of a consciously curated group of very important people but she says “i have worked very hard to have my relationships be substantial” and that seems to be true “she’s not a networker she’s a magnet” says dambisa moyo “she is a wisdom seeker and a mentor seeker” says ann davis vaughan “she is a sponge always looking to soak up other people’s words to live by advice about how the world works how to develop character how to build an organization it isn’t just to get ahead it’s on a deeper level she is always seeking this profound wisdom”hobson’s connections have shaped her life it is through bill bradley that she first met howard schultz which resulted in her joining starbucks’ board in  schultz who then served on the board of dreamworks animation introduced her to katzenberg in  mellody joined that board “she’s the kind of person that if you called her at three in the morning and asked her to get something impossible done she would have it done—at sunrise” says schultzhobson’s friends also cite her humor her ability to listen her clear sense of right and wrong—and her candor “neither mellody nor my wife attended the graduate school of diplomacy” says dick parsons “she is appropriate and polite but she leans toward the pole of candor and rightbetweentheeyes rather than sugarcoating people say about me that i can fire them and they leave thinking they got a raise that’s not a risk with mellody”her candor can be jarring and when it isn’t accompanied by the warmth she shows those she has chosen to befriend it can give her an icy quality “i am very direct” she says “it is not well received by all i play better with people who can take it those who are selfconfident but i know that limits my world which is not good so i’m trying to be more cognizant of that” she adds “people can be crushed by my point of view now more than ever you get this mystique and your words have more consequences than you intended”the flip side of her honesty is that she’s not jaded she recalls going to david geffen’s house for the first time for a dreamworks animation board meeting “it is moguls r us” she says of her fellow board members “i walk in and say ‘this is the nicest house i’ve ever been in’ then i think what am i saying you all have really nice houses but to pretend that it’s not a big thing isn’t right even if saying it made me look like a country bumpkin i am still in awe of the life i lead i don’t ever want anyone to think i take it for granted i am amazed by it”and that points to her most remarkable trait she is part of many different worlds the financial world the social world the political world hollywood but she hasn’t lost herself in any of them “even in that very highpowered group of amazing and intimidating people mellody is mellody” says thompson “to be the same person no matter what that is very rare”this past spring hobson was invited to give a ted talk the ultimate sign of inclusion and recognition among those who pride themselves on their smarts she’s long been passionate about financial literacy and often says her lifetime goal is to make the stock market a regular topic of dinnertable conversation for every africanamerican family and so she wrote two separate ted talks one was on financial literacy the other was on raceshe began the talk on race by recounting a story about helping to organize an editorialboard lunch for harold ford jr when he was running for the us senate in tennessee in  “so harold and i went to the party and we arrived at the event in our best suits looking like shiny new pennies” she said they followed the receptionist not paying much attention “until suddenly we end up in a stark room and the receptionist turns to harold and me and thinking we were the waitstaff asks ‘where are your uniforms’ ”hobson has always been outspoken about race “in private settings people do not talk about differences” says sandberg “she does and always did she does it in such a way that people are able to hear it and she does not mince words”even so some of her friends thought a talk about race wasn’t a wise ideabut hobson has always remembered her mother’s question how did they treat you and then she read a story about a woman who would always tell her child “be brave” “i had one of those moments where i said ‘this is it’ ” she says she titled her speech “color blind or color brave” and she said “my challenge to you is simply this observe your environment at work at home at school and if you don’t see any diversity work to change it” “i am not a oneissue person” she says “but it is important to me and i feel incredibly uniquely positioned to talk about it ‘if mellody is saying it maybe we need to think about it’ ”and if there’s anyone who can blow stereotypes to bits and get people to listen it is mellody hobsonshareemailfacebooktwitteryou might liketrump claims “complete power” to begin issuing pardonsvanity fairhas

freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted triples freebasewikidata mappings license citing freebase triples this dataset contains every fact currently in freebase total triples  billion updated weekly data format ntriples rdf license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the rdf data is serialized using the ntriples format encoded as utf

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
