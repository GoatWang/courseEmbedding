and random vomiting constant nausea balance problems excessive hight growth menstural problems debilitating back pain delayed response times and other odd symptoms over the years i was diagnosed with mono many times polycystic ovaries chronic anxiety manic depression bulimia hypochondria fibromyalgia among many other diseases i ended up getting my tonsils out for one reason or another at the age of  and had to get a brain scan before this could be done the mri was sent to weingart and the surgeon there was a golfball sized tumor clearly on the mri which was not reported by the radiologist eitherit just said to follow up there was no follow up at the age of  my neurological symptoms and back pain skyrocketed and i began having seizures i finally ended up getting another scan of my brain that showed a que ball sizwd tumor in my right frontal lobe i dont blame all of this on dr w but he should have done a lot more to assess my symptoms in the first place i have had  open craniotomies now and have a stage  oligoastrocytoma brain cancer i recently had an mri of my back that also shows a completely collapsed disc one of the drs pas had seen a prior mri at the age of  and told me there was nothing wrong i will be getting surgery on my back in  month and i am only  years old by ashley martin xxxxxx july     report this review ive never waited more than  minutes to be seen appointments have always been easy to schedule not requiring several days to be seen by dr weingart i have found the staff to be professional courteous and attentive this family medicine practice sees patients across the spectrum agewise and the staff knows many by name how rare i never really had the opportunity to read magazines while waiting because my wait was always very brief dr weingart is a caring physician who makes suggestions regarding steps he thinks his patient should take and is very thorough in his explanation for why he thinks they would be prudent decisions i would highly recommend dr james weingart as a primary physician by r j anderson january    view all reviews recent polls   report this review do you feel that you could have received better service somewhere else
