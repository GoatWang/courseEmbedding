private cloud openstack public cloud security customers racker culture newsroom home racker culture why i’m leaving rackspace racker culture why i’m leaving rackspace by taylor rhodes  may   this morning i announced to my fellow rackers the toughest decision i’ve ever had to make i’m leaving the company that i love where i’ve worked for the past decade and made lifelong friends and where it’s been my honor to serve as ceo my friend jeff cotten now rackspace president will step up as interim ceo our board has launched a search for a longterm ceo and it considers jeff a strong candidate for that position kelley freeman a local author who has worked as a coach to some of our executives observes that “the last act of leading is leaving” what he means in the context of a ceo is that when you’ve taken your company as far as you can given your particular strengths and skills it’s time to let someone else with different strengths step up and take it farther that’s how i feel today i’m proud to have led rackspace through a hinge in its history as we seized the leadership of the young and fastgrowing market for managed cloud services and as we went private under the ownership of apollo global management and its partners we recently reported strong fourthquarter results to our bond and debt holders and  is shaping up to be even stronger as we’re exceeding almost all of the financial targets we established with apollo and our board i know i’m leaving the company in good hands with jeff as its new leader and a strong bench of leaders around him he and i have been friends and colleagues since we worked together at eds i’m proud to have recruited him to rackspace over the past eight years he has held a series of increasingly challenging leadership roles across key areas of the company from customer support to sales and new business development he spent several years based in london and zurich growing our international business which now produces about a third of our  billion in annual revenue and he played a pivotal role in developing and scaling our new services for customers who want us to run workloads for them on the infrastructure of amazon web services and microsoft azure — and in the near future on the google cloud platform these new services are market leading and our customers are expressing their love for them through rapid growth and high net promoter scores in each of his roles jeff has inspired his teams to succeed he commands deep respect throughout rackspace i leave with confidence that he and a new generation of rackspace leaders will bring fresh eyes to the company’s challenges and opportunities what’s next for me i’m going to become the ceo of a smaller private company it’s based in another city it does not compete with rackspace i’ll be able to talk more specifically about it in a couple of weeks but for now let me just say that it’s about the size rackspace was when i started here  years ago — and it’s growing about as rapidly it’s using cloud technologies to disrupt what has been a very lowtech industry the company is going through growing pains and needs a ceo who has been through those challenges before this opportunity fits my strengths and skills and i think it will provide a reinvigorating change this new job at a smaller company will also give me more control over my schedule and more time with my kids before the two oldest who are now in high school leave home for college i’ll miss rackspace and the rackers i love and my family and i will miss san antonio but we plan to stay in touch with the great friends we’ve made here we’ll always be fans of the city and the spurs and rackspace and we’ll be watching and applauding all three from afar go rackspace go share this posttweet  comments good luck on your new endeavors reply wishing you continued success taylor a leader who truly inspires and demonstrates what it means to succeed and make things happen best wishes on your next venture reply good luck taylor you provided business and ethical leadership to a lot of people over the years reply taylor this is shocking as much as sad i left rackspace a year back and have enjoyed every minute working with you i wish you the very best and hope our paths cross again even though i am in a different continent now i am sure you will lead from the front wherever you are headed next reply

proud to have recruited him to rackspace over the past eight years he has held a series of increasingly challenging leadership roles across key areas of the company from customer support to sales and new business development he spent several years based in london and zurich growing our international business which now produces about a third of our  billion in annual revenue and he played a pivotal role in developing and scaling our new services for customers who want us to run workloads for them on the infrastructure of amazon web services and microsoft azure — and in the near future on the google cloud platform these new services are market leading and our customers are expressing their love for them through rapid growth and high net promoter scores in each of his roles jeff has inspired his teams to succeed he commands deep respect throughout rackspace i leave with confidence that he and a new generation of rackspace leaders will bring fresh eyes to the company’s challenges and opportunities what’s next for me i’m going to become the ceo of a smaller private company it’s based in another city it does not compete with rackspace i’ll be able to talk more specifically about it in a couple of weeks but for now let me just say that it’s about the size rackspace was when i started here  years ago — and it’s growing about as rapidly it’s using cloud technologies to disrupt what has been a very lowtech industry the company is going through growing pains and needs a ceo who has been through those challenges before this opportunity fits my strengths and skills and i think it will provide a reinvigorating change this new job at a smaller company will also give me more control over my schedule and more time with my kids before the two oldest who are now in high school leave home for college i’ll miss rackspace and the rackers i love and my family and i will miss san antonio but we plan to stay in touch with the great friends we’ve made here we’ll always be fans of the city and the spurs and rackspace and we’ll be watching and applauding all three from afar go rackspace go share this posttweet  comments good luck on your new endeavors reply wishing you continued
