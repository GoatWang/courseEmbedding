redwood city ca   phone    fax   history – sooch foundation sooch foundation improving lives through education history sooch foundation was founded by navdeep sooch founder and chairman of the board of silicon laboratories a mixedsignal chip design company headquartered in austin texas nav was born in punjab india he moved to detroit michigan at age ten where he attended detroit public schools and the university of michigan he completed his graduate work at stanford university nav credits his personal success chiefly to the educational opportunities afforded him he believes that education can be the single biggest factor in an individual reaching a level of full selfsufficiency for this reason when nav decided to start his own private charitable foundation he made it a highest priority to find entities willing to help open the doors of better educational opportunities to the poorest of the poor as a product of us public schools nav acknowledges that the public and private school system in the us is still among the best in the world while at the same time realizing that an equal education is not available to all the foundation is committed to helping economically disadvantaged people achieve better access to the strengths of the system with the ultimate goal of helping them reach financial independence for themselves their families and their descendants through betterment of their education since silicon laboratories is founded and centered in austin sooch foundation limits its funding to educational programs located in this community and serving austinites previously the foundation also supported projects in india in honor of nav’s heritage semitough facebook  email  more pinterest print twitter semitough semiconductor whiz navdeep sooch is one of the hottest entrepreneurs alive but hed rather not talk about it by ellise piercefebruary comments press spacebar to see more share options the first thing to understand about navdeep sooch is that he does not do things casually there is always a purpose a goal when he decided to take up golf four years ago it wasn’t because he wanted to drink beer with friends at the nineteenth hole his objective was to qualify to play in the buckman cup an elite annual tournament at austin’s barton creek resort and club so he took private lessons he hit balls at the driving range four times a week his score dropped precipitously and that spring he not only qualified to play in the buckman—a remarkable feat for a rank novice—but also won his flight in the club championship tournament sooch would never share such a story like most of the other interesting details about him it comes from his wife but this sort of determination is precisely what has pushed him and his company silicon laboratories to the forefront of one of the hottest industries in the world specialty computer chips when sooch now  cofounded silicon laboratories in  he left a  job and took no salary for six months betting everything he had on a new type of chip design today as silicon labs’ chairman and ceo his shares in the company which designs chips that make modems and cell phones more efficient are worth  million those shares were worth as much as  million last year—which landed sooch on fortune‘s “america’s forty richest under ” list that was before the hightech armageddon in the stock market began in april in spite of the market drop industry analysts are confident of silicon labs’ future and even at the lower valuation it’s not a bad haul for three years’ work the second important thing to understand about sooch is that he would rather do almost anything than say something revealing about himself his strippeddown secondfloor office in a nondescript building in southwest austin tells you little about the man other than that he is spartan precise and—this he will admit—”no nonsense” he wears sensible black slacks and a beige cotton sweater small neat stacks of manila folders line the top of his desk where there is but one item that could be considered personal—a handpainted coffee mug that his daughter kelly made for him for father’s day when she was three he never uses it though because he rarely drinks coffee his recent award from ernst and young as the area’s entrepreneur of the year doesn’t hang on the wall neither does the framed stock certificate from when silicon labs went public on march   and which quickly boosted his net worth above half a billion they’re both at home decorating his wife’s office he refuses to let her order the plaques for the  patents he has received “no selfrespecting engineer would put those things up” he says “it’s too pretentious” his silver bmw i and red porsche carrera however are apparently not too pretentious cars are his one weakness as it turns out and it is comforting to know at least that he has one he drives both cars at speeds that sometimes top  miles per hour along the curvy hilly twolane road from his fivebedroom westlake hills home to his office this detail does not come from sooch either it is related by his wife who has heard the breathless accounts of their three children who have been along on some of the joyrides when asked to describe what exactly he does sooch leaning forward over his desk is immediately evasive “my role is   ” he says pausing for a moment and smiling coyly “i’m the leader so i don’t do anything” this will no doubt delight his shareholders who have already watched the price of their shares fall from a high of  in march of last year to a low of  in january of course he’s lying silicon labs is not a flybynight dotcom and didn’t grow from zero to  million in annual revenues in just four years’ time—up  percent over last year—with a chief executive who does nothing at all walking past an empty office on a monday afternoon sooch hesitates for a moment as if he really has forgotten that he’s the leader and then slips in he picks up a plastic container resting on the desk where a single black chip just threeeighths of an inch long is nestled in gray foam this is one of his products “here’s one” he says and angles the chip toward the light a bit of real enthusiasm creeping into his voice “see where the plastic is etched off that’s the actual silicon it’s beautiful” navdeep sooch was born in amritsar in northern india in  the second child of shangara and pritam sooch both had been raised on farms in the agrarian state of punjab and after their marriage they wanted to break free from the country’s rigid caste system they went to college then moved to detroit as it turned out degrees from india didn’t help them find work in the us so they both enrolled in wayne state university while nav and his sister jasdeep stayed behind in amritsar where they attended catholic boarding school a few years later when sooch was ten he and his sister joined their parents living in a small apartment in an area known as the cass corridor one of the city’s roughest neighborhoods he became more fluent in english picking up slang to go along with it his mother worked as a high school librarian his father was a systems analyst at michigan bell they lived frugally and within a few years the family had saved enough to buy a modest house in the suburbs sooch attended the university of michigan and majored in the closest thing to electronics that he could find—electrical engineering he quickly learned the language of ones and zeros but he found digital design unchallenging he focused instead on the rarest and most difficult type of electronic circuitry design—socalled mixedsignal—which takes analog signals like sound and radio waves and converts them into finite digital numbers for computers after graduating at nineteen sooch worked for att bell laboratories and went to graduate school in electrical engineering at stanford university where he sometimes skipped classes and borrowed notes from another electrical engineering student janet harman within three years he got his master’s degree married harman and received four patents for integratedcircuit chips in  sooch took a job with the austin startup crystal semiconductor because he was so impressed with dave welland an mit graduate who instead of conducting an interview argued with him for hours over the finer points of mixedsignal design they also found a common bond in their favorite baseball team the detroit tigers at crystal sooch worked as both a design engineer and as a vice president of engineering and watched the company’s austin site grow from twenty employees to a thousand fastforward eleven years to the summer of  sooch welland and another mit grad jeff scott whom sooch had met at att left the office of what was now cirrus logic’s crystal semiconductor for what was to be a defining lunch all three were unhappy with the company’s growth and missed the excitement of what was once a smaller closeknit organization “it wasn’t as much fun as it was in the old days” sooch recalls so they drove to homestead bar bq on burleson road and talked about starting their own company “we had gone back and forth for a while about whether we had the guts to leave” says welland who at  is the eldest of the trio “we continued to jalisco’s and lunch became beers” hours later they still weren’t able to reach a consensus “we decided to flip a coin and it came up heads to do it” says welland the three of them turned in their notices and began having meetings around various kitchen tables about what exactly their new company would make “we knew that it was going to be chips but what kind of chip what application we didn’t know” says sooch “i remember we’d have these planning sessions which basically boiled down to drinking a lot of wine” and so with a downtown office given to them by their lawyers they did what any other design engineers would do—they started ripping things apart they dissected cell phones fax machines computers and answering machines searching for components that could be replaced with computer chips or integrated circuits after four months they found what they were looking for on a modem card—”a big bulky transformer and messy electronic relays optoisolators and a whole bunch of crap” says scott this collection of gadgetry had a couple of key functions it provided an isolation barrier which protected the phone line from electrical power surges and it translated the computer’s digital language into analog so that it could travel through the phone lines and vice versa they did an internet search and discovered that this part of the modem was called the daa or direct access arrangement which was regulated by the federal communications commission and something that by law every modem had to have none of them had ever heard of a daa before and they were excited at the prospect of trying to duplicate the process on an integrated circuit which would make modems smaller and cheaper and they figured that since no one had made a more elegant daa it must be difficult to design “that’s the kind of thing that we were looking for” says sooch “things that were really hard that other people had given up on” at the same time welland had discovered another opportunity hidden in a cell phone—a clunky radio frequency synthesizer that assigns a frequency or a channel to each incoming call like the ugly daa on the modem card he figured that this too could be replaced with a smaller less expensive chip in march  with a  million investment from austin ventures and two ideas they were in business they lined up orders with modem manufacturer pc tel and com corporation’s us robotics unit the largest maker of computer modems by the end of  the young company had more than  million in revenues getting a second round of financing for  million was easy by the time the company went public it had  million in revenues and was already making profits last year the company’s thirdquarter revenues alone were  million with profits of  million the company has since improved the daa chip making it programmable to meet international specifications rolled out the rf radio frequency chip to cell phone manufacturers in europe and introduced three more products—a chip that allows satellite payperview boxes to send a bill directly to the phone company a chip that generates ringing at the line’s end at the phone company and a chip that recovers computergenerated data transferred on the internet with nearly a dozen more chips to be introduced this year silicon labs will be that much closer to its rather breathtaking goal—to dominate wireless wireline and opticalnetworking communications with mixedsignal chips and realize  billion in revenues in six years’ time at a growth rate of  percent annually sooch thinks he can do it “i think we expected this” he says nonchalantly in a rare moment of selfdisclosure he adds “but do i look back and pinch myself every now and then yes” get texas monthly daily related content the
