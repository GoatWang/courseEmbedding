volatility  read more breaking news sponsored by home  trading  trading advice  united states oil fund uso is stretched — short it a pullback looms for the uso etf heres how to capitalize jul    pm edt    by tyler craig tales of a technician     commodities have rather enjoyed the us dollar’s recent death spiral greenback weakness has delivered gains to everyone from gold and silver to crude oil but the upside in oil may soon slow and that has me eyeing some contrarian trades in the united states oil fund lp etf nysearcauso with overhead resistance looming close bearish plays in uso may be worth a shot here interestingly enough the relationship between oil prices and the dollar wasn’t very consistent during the first half of the year sometimes they moved together sometimes they moved apart but in the month of july we’ve finally seen the pair revert to their normal relationship with dollar weakness delivering strength to uso as shown below the day correlation between the us dollar index and uso is  which is quite negative source optionsanalytix since bottoming at  in midjune uso has rallied  popping above the day and day moving averages in the process while rising above both smoothing mechanisms would normally count as a victory for the bulls uso hasn’t really been responding to either average its disrespect is likely due to its trendless nature in recent years the sixweek rally has driven the rsi indicator close to overbought territory matter of fact it’s perched at the same level as where the last six oil rallies finally topped out throw it all together and bearish oil trades are starting to look attractive source optionsanalytix short uso calls in timing the entry it’s worth waiting for signs that crude is topping uso has now carved out four updays in a row so we’ll want to see a down candle or at least a break of intraday support before pulling the trigger uso’s overall neutral nature not to mention its small price tag makes it a prime candidate for option selling once we start to see weakness creep in sell the sep  calls for around  cents you can think of it as a wager that uso will sit below  at september expiration but you don’t have to ride it till the bitter end i suggest exiting if you can snatch back the calls near  cents anytime over the duration of the trade as of this writing tyler craig did not hold a position in any of the
