surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using

français register sign in abeona therapeutics receives fda orphan drug designation for eb gene therapy product for patients with epidermolysis bullosa may    et  source abeona therapeutics inc abeona’s third gene therapy program to receive fda orphan designation eb gene therapy for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa rdeb has demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in ongoing phase  clinical trial new york and cleveland may   globe newswire  abeona therapeutics inc nasdaqabeo a leading clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel gene therapies for lifethreatening rare diseases announced today that the fda has granted orphan drug designation odd for abeona’s eb gene therapy program for patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa deb including recessive dystrophic epidermolysis  bullosa rdeb which are lifethreatening genetic skin disorders characterized by skin blisters and erosions that cover the body “abeona is committed to advancing innovative gene therapies that address the unmet needs of patients suffering with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa a devastating rare skin disease  we are grateful that the fda has recognized eb as a rare disease product that may offer a significant therapeutic benefit for patients with dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa including rdeb  eb is abeona’s third gene therapy program to be granted orphan drug designation by the fda an important value driver for the program as it provides seven years of market exclusivity from similar medicines for similar indications” stated timothy j miller phd president  ceo of abeona therapeutics inc typically wounds on patients with rdeb also known as butterfly skin syndrome can remain unhealed for months to years due to the inability of the skin to stay attached to the underlying dermis and can cover a large percentage of the body  in the phase  clinical trial eb was administered to nonhealing chronic wounds on each subject and assessed for wound healing at predefined time points over years the primary endpoints of the clinical trial assess safety and evaluate wound healing after eb administration compared to control untreated wounds secondary endpoints include expression of collagen c and restoration of anchoring fibrils at three and six months postadministration clinical data were recently presented at the society of investigative dermatology sid conference by stanford collaborators and demonstrated that eb treated wounds were significantly healed  for more than  years postadministration the data showed wound healing defined as  closure after eb administration was observed in  treated wounds n subjects at  months   treated wounds n subjects at  months  treated wounds n subjects at  months   treated wounds n subjects at  months  treated wounds n subject at  months postadministration collagen vii c expression c and morphologically normal nc reactive anchoring fibrils – the “zipper” that holds skin onto the underlying tissue and the primary deficit in rdeb patients – were observed in eb treated wounds up to two years post administration importantly data from a supportive natural history study of  wounds from  patients with rdeb established by stanford and ebcare registry were also presented at the conference notably in the natural history study  rdeb patients with a total of  chronic wounds were treated with an allograft product including apligraf® and dermagraft® of these wounds treated with allografts only   treated wounds remained healed after  weeks and   treated wounds remained healed after  weeks this is a meaningful finding of the natural history study as there are no approved therapies for rdeb patients that demonstrate significant wound closure after two months postapplication about orphan drug designation under the fda’s orphan drug designation program orphan drug designation is granted by the fda to novel drugs or biologics that treat rare diseases or conditions affecting fewer than  patients in the us the designation allows the drug developer to be eligible for a sevenyear period of us marketing exclusivity upon approval of the drug as well as tax credits for clinical research costs the ability to apply for annual grant funding clinical trial design assistance and the waiver of prescription drug user fee act pdufa filing fees about eb eb is an
