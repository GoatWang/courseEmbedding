first defiance financial corp’s second quarter conference call last night we issued our  second quarter earnings release and now i’d like to discuss the second quarter results and give you an outlook for the remainder of ‘ joining me on the call this morning to give more detail on the financial performance for the quarter is our cfo kevin thompson at the conclusion of our remarks we will answer any questions you might have overall we continue to be pleased with the sustained momentum toward our strategic goals the second quarter represented the first full quarter of combined results from the commercial bancshares transaction and also included the operating results of corporate one benefits a full service employee benefits consulting organization acquired in april net income for the second quarter of ‘ on a gaap basis was  million or  per diluted common share compared with  million and  per diluted common share in the second quarter of ‘ our second quarter financial results clearly reflect the expected operating performance enhancements from our recent acquisitions as revenues were up  over the second quarter last year the efficiency ratio improved to  from  and pretax preprovisions earning improved by  over the same period last year while higher chargeoffs for credit losses partially offset these improvements in the second quarter we expect the benefits from our mergers to continue elevating our ongoing performance our overall core performance this quarter helped drive a solid return on average assets of  we experienced yearoveryear and linked quarter annualized core loan – net loan growth of  and  respectively second quarter loan growth was impacted by a large payoff in the  million range related to an apartment project we continue to focus our ability to grow our loan portfolio with a balanced approach the lending environment is very competitive with rate and structure pressures relating to terms and conditions in the uncertain economic environment we continue to be disciplined in our pricing approach and purposely pass on lending relationships that would force us what we consider overly aggressive pricing in term concessions we did not see any material movement in local market rates either leading up to the fed hike or subsequently to it with contributions from across our entire footprint and a solid pipeline at the end of the second quarter up from the first quarter end we are optimistic as we are on track to achieve our annual growth goal in the upper singledigits loan originations for the quarter were the highest since the fourth quarter of ‘ and loan yields was about  basis points higher in aggregate than the first quarter this coupled with stronger confidence from segments of our clients concerning economic stability in the economic environment leads us to believe we have positioned ourselves for continued discipline loan growth during the remainder of ‘ we are also very pleased with our margin improvement this quarter over the second quarter of ‘ and on a linked quarter basis the growth in both our net interest income and our core noninterest income revenues on a quarterly basis is a result of contributions from our core business strategies kevin will provide more color on the detail in a few minutes we saw a slight increase in mortgage banking revenues yearoveryear despite a decrease on a linked quarter basis total noninterest expense decreased from the first quarter of ‘ primarily due to merger and conversionrelated costs in the first quarter the efficiency ratio of  in the second quarter reflected some of the benefit of the first quarter’s esb acquisition in the overall expense control the credit quality metrics showed moderate regression this quarter from the second quarter of  on a linked quarter basis nonperforming assets increased to  from  in the second quarter of ‘ nonperforming loans increased approximately  million approximately  of the nonperforming loans continued to make payments we also had a slight increase in restructuring loans this quarter the level of  to  day delinquencies were  of loans for the second quarter of ‘ compared with  at the second quarter of ‘ and  march of ‘ while we are disappointed in the uptick in nonperforming loans and associated chargeoffs we do not believe it indicates an overall trend but more relates to a couple of specific credits believed to be contained we expect to work hard to see stable to improving asset quality trends across the board in the nearterm in regards to our capital management plans we are also pleased to announce a  second quarter dividend of  per share representing a  increase over a prior year and an annual dividend yield of approximately  i will now ask kevin thompson to provide additional financial details for the quarter before i conclude kevin thompson thank you don and good morning to everybody as don stated net income for the second quarter was  million or  per diluted share and these results reflect the first full quarter of operating results inclusive of both our commercial savings bank or csb merger and our corporate one benefits agency or corporate one merger the quarter also included  per diluted share impact from merger and conversion expenses primarily for the corporate one acquisition which was essentially offset by securities gains of  per diluted share the quarterly results compared to prior year’s second quarter results of  million or  per diluted share as don also indicated while disappointed in the higher nonperforming assets and credit costs this quarter we are much more satisfied by our performance in all other areas of our financial results even with our higher credit costs our return on assets for the quarter was a very respectable  now turning to the details and starting with the balance sheet the second quarter total loan growth was  million which was net of a large  million payoff right before the end of the quarter average loan balances grew  million on a linked quarter basis mostly due to the full quarter impact of our csb merger on the other hand total deposits reflected a decrease of  million from march  to june  the decline resulted from a runup in deposits of nearly  million right at the end of the first quarter and those deposits exited the bank by the end of the second quarter the growth in average deposits of  million on a linked quarter basis was again mostly due to the full quarter impact from the csb merger compared to june  a year ago organic growth excluding the csb merger shows loans have grown about  million or  and deposits up about  million or  we would expect to maintain these growth rates at a minimum as well as our strong earning asset mix low cost deposit funding and profitable margin going forward which leads us to the income statement our net interest income was  million for the second quarter of  up from  million in the linked quarter and up  million or  from the  million in the second quarter last year the increase over the prior year includes the addition of csb for the full quarter as well as some benefit from recovered interest of prepayment penalties collected which totaled  in the second quarter  versus only  in the same period last year allin our margin this quarter was  up  basis points from last quarter and up  basis points from  in the second quarter last year on a linked quarter basis our yield on earning assets was up  basis points as our loan portfolio yield rose to  boosted about  basis points to  basis points by the recovered interest and prepayment fees our cost of interest bearing liabilities was up  basis points on a linked quarter basis impacted by both rate and mix as we grow our balance sheet we are very pleased with the strength and stability of our margin and our interest rate risk position which remains basically neutral and well balanced for our expectation of continued action by the fed total noninterest income was  million in the second quarter of  down from  million in the linked quarter which included  million enhancement gain on a fully purchased as well as seasonal contingent insurance commission but it was up from  million in the second quarter of  the second quarter  did include  of securities gains while the second quarter last year included  of securities gains excluding the securities gains quarterly noninterest income up yearoveryear about  million or  other than the gains on sale of nonmortgage loans we had increases in all categories of fee income which were predominantly due to the contributions from the csb and corporate one mergers regarding mortgage banking revenues for the second quarter were  – up in the second quarter of  were  million up only  from the linked quarter and up  from the second quarter of  the second quarter mortgage banking originations were  million compared to  million last quarter and  million in the second quarter  gain on sale income was  million in the second quarter compared to  million on a linked quarter basis of  million in the second quarter last year in addition the second quarter included a positive valuation adjustment to mortgage servicing rights of  compared to a positive adjustment of  last quarter and a negative adjustment of  in the second quarter of  at june   first defiance had  billion of loan service for others and the mortgage servicing rights associated with those loans had a fair value of  million or  basis points of the outstanding loan balances serviced total impairment reserves which were available for recapture in future periods totaled  at quarter end as for noninterest expense second quarter expenses totaled  million down from  million in the linked quarter which included  million of merger and conversion expenses but up from  million in the second quarter of  while the second quarter  did include about  of acquisition costs for csb and corporate one the bulk of the increase was attributable to the additional operating costs from those mergers we were very pleased to see the improvement in our efficiency ratio with this quarter cost synergies were the key driver in the csb merger and our efficiency ratio of  in the second quarter of  versus  in the second quarter last year reflects this benefit regarding asset quality provision expense in the second quarter of  totaled  million compared to a provision of  last quarter and  in the second quarter last year provision expense increased or the increase resulted from the downgrade of two larger credits in the quarter and net chargeoffs recorded totaling just under  million or  basis points annualized this compared to net loan chargeoffs of  basis points in last quarter and net recoveries of  basis points in the second quarter a year ago our allowance for loan loss at june   was  million up  versus march  and basically even with a year ago allowance to loan ratio at june   remained at  the same as last quarter but down from  last year the decline in the ratio from last year was primarily due to the addition of the acquired csb loans which were discounted and recorded at fair value with no allowance the csb acquired loans are currently carried at a discount of  million or  of balances as for the asset quality numbers with the two large downgrades totaling  million nonperforming loans increased this quarter to  million from  million on a linked quarter basis and from  million at june   our oreo balance remained low this quarter at  compared to  last quarter and  million in the second quarter last year overall nonperforming assets ended the quarter at  million or  of total assets up from  million or  of total assets at june   our troubled debt restructured loans this quarter were  million up from  million last quarter and  million a year ago as a result of the increase in npas at quarter end the allowance coverage of nonperforming assets was  compared to  at june  a year ago while the numbers are impacted by the two downgrades on which the losses were taken we are confident that the quality of the remainder of the portfolio continues to reflect strengthened asset quality from a year ago looking at our capital position total period end stockholders equity finished the quarter at  million up from  million at june   reflecting the acquisition of commercial bancshares unless our capital position remains strong the quarter end shareholders equity to assets of  up from  last year the banks total risk based capital ratio is approximately  at june   our healthy capital position continues to support our growth and shareholder value enhancement strategies so in summary our balance sheet remains solid the acquisitions of csb and corporate one are delivering the expected benefits our core operating profitability is strong we believe the credit events this quarter are uncharacteristic of our asset quality and thus our outlook remains clearly positive that completes my financial review and i will turn the call back over to don don hileman thank you kevin to achieve our goal of being consistently high performing community bank we have recognized that it involves more than numbers on the balance sheet it takes balancing high performance with strong values earlier this year we introduced our new missionvision and value statements that evolved from employee and customer feedback our mission statement now states as a high performing community bank are engaged in value employees provide smart solutions to our clients and communities this key statement explains what we do and why we are here which above all else is to provide our clients and community with solutions that fit their needs and add value to their lives and goals by delivering these smart solutions we help achieve our vision of remaining a high performing community organization with our new missionvision and value statements we believe we have reenergized our teams and now more than ever have a synergy when working to accomplish our goals as a result we have made significant progress on our initiatives to retain and attract top talent grow our customer base build an environment that fosters innovative solutions for internal process enhanced client experience our steady performance client focused values and our engaged employees blend together to deliver exceptional results to our shareholders first defiance leverages these principles to keep us moving forward as we look to expand our branch and agency networks through mergers and acquisitions and to deeper relationships within our footprints especially in our metal markets we continue to pursue organic growth in fort wayne indiana and toledo and columbus ohio and we are seeing increased activity in these areas we still have confidence that a high singledigit growth rate is achievable for the remainder of the year despite the previously noted competitive lending environment loan growth and an overall – and an increase in loan yields will be fueled by our model building relationships and relationship pricing not just performing transactions when we did see an improvement in the metro market loan growth rate this quarter we understand we will be challenged to grow loans and maintain yield management where the asset yields continue to outpace liability costs yearoveryear however we believe our delivery and service model was effective and contributing to a solid margin growth performance growth in our insurance and wealth management revenues will continue to be a focal point in our overall strategic plan this was evidenced by our recent insurance acquisition of corporate one benefits and its contribution to revenue growth this quarter we believe these revenue sources help in our ability to grow noninterest revenues in an environment without any pressures on nsf fees and other deposit related fees we are also pleased with the steady increase in wealth management and trust revenues our teams have made significant progress in enhancing our client experience within the next quarter we look forward to adding convenience the way our clients bank with us by offering people pay a digital payment solution use smart atms at selected locations and improved online mortgage experience with first insurance group a new app that allows clients to handle multiple aspects of their insurance relationship these advancements give our customers additional flexibility and net value as they look to bank beyond our branch stores to continue this progression we have dedicated resources working to expand operational capabilities and enhance the organization’s overall efficiency stability and productivity we are introducing new data management software that will allow us to deepen our understanding of our customers banking relationships and behaviors to deliver more personalized banking solution as the banking behaviors of our clients change we will focus on adapting our service and sales models for a mere convenience or more convenience better client banking experience for all our customers these strategic initiatives lead our focus and commitment to improving our results

consistently high performing community bank we remain strongly committed to our customers and shareholders and we appreciate the confidence you have placed in us do work to make first defiance a company known for providing smart solutions to our customers and communities thank you for your interest in first defiance and we thank you for joining us this morning we will now be glad to take your questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question comes from matthew forgotson of sandler o’neill  partners please go ahead matthew forgotson hi good morning gentlemen don hileman good morning kevin thompson good morning matt matthew forgotson just i am wondering looking for a little bit more color here on the two large credits that moved on to the nonaccrual can you give us a little color about the loan type whether or not they are not paying as agreed where they are marked and then i guess just lastly any additional credit outstanding to these borrowers don hileman the credit that we took the large chargeoff was in the ci portfolio we have entered into for balance agreement with that particular borrower and they will be continuing to make payments on that particular credit so we think we have got it appropriately marked with the chargeoffs that we have took this quarter on that and the other is in the commercial real estate portfolio and we believe that’s the timing issue on that credit matthew forgotson okay so it sounds like you are clearly positioning these as oneoff events and it sounds like we should expect a remediation ie lower level of nonperforming loans in the not too distant future is that a reasonable expectation don hileman that’s our expectation that we want to work to that now these two credits they are not going to cure themselves next quarter but we do not anticipate an increase higher level of nonperformings going forward we looked at this similar circumstance as we looked at some larger credits deep dive to get ourselves comfortable that this isn’t a trend that these are like you said categorized more as a oneoff and that’s what we really believe at this point matthew forgotson okay just out of curiosity were they ag credits or small manufacturers or which industry were they don hileman they were not ag one is in healthcare facilities and the other is more of a smaller operating units that provides services to utilities industry matthew forgotson okay great i guess and can you just zoom out one of your teams coming out of the credit cycle was the commitment to managing proactively and with that approach we sense that you have got a pretty good pulse on the credit market and so forth as you think through your portfolio are there any areas where you are paying more attention just in light of what we have seen in auto for example or some incremental softening in ag how are you feeling about those two books and any other pressure points don hileman we clearly are spending a little bit more focus on ag we have seen some early indications of some stress especially with the smaller ag credits and we are looking at the most recent wet midwest here we have had and that impact on our client we don’t see any material losses in that portfolio at this point of time but we are – spend a little more attention to the ag portfolio related to the other general question about other concentrations i think we will continue to focus on some of the markets the potential overbuilding of multifamily and how that relates to our portfolio and where we stand with that feel comfortable at this point but i think that will be some possibly constraining of growth opportunities in that in certain markets as we go forward the auto industry we are not very correlated with that as far as our direct relationships we have several very indirect auto relationships that are providing a small part in the overall process but generally we are not really dependent on how the auto industry goes other than from the employment standpoint but don’t really see any other sectors that we are overly concerned with now individually for us matthew forgotson great okay i guess last for me and then i will hop out but average loan growth was strong end of the period loan growth just a little bit sluggish in large measure due to the repayment you have made – you cited however yeartodate organic loans are up only about  on an annualized basis by my math and i guess to get the upper singledigit implies a pretty steep ramp from here in the back half of the year so when you say upper singledigit are you thinking call it    and is it really reasonable to get there kevin thompson when i look at the numbers matt and i know that pay off it happens so you can’t totally ignore it but organic growth in the first quarter was about  million second quarter we are showing  million but it is just that  million by the  ph it would be  million which would be  with the size of our current pipeline which is at like an alltime high over the last  years we are feeling pretty confident about being able to deliver in that mid upper singledigit growth over the remainder of the year don hileman we have realized that we have to execute on that front our indications are targeting our loan people and our market area presidents and that they are feeling – that is not just don and kevin think of we can do it they are the ones driving our decision and our communications kevin thompson but our momentum has certainly been building as don indicated our loan originations were way up in the second quarter so our outlook is that that is a very doable number for us matthew forgotson thank you very much kevin thompson sure operator the next question comes from damon delmonte of kbw please go ahead damon delmonte hey good morning guys how is it going today don hileman good how are you doing damon delmonte good thanks good good just to kind of tack on to the loan growth question the loans that you guys have been putting on that you are seeing in your pipeline are these all selforiginated loans or are you guys participating in many shared national credits don hileman no no new originations and shared national credit kevin thompson right all originated by us don hileman by us we just have one shared national credit that we are involved in damon delmonte okay is that a local loan or is that a loan lender that is outside the market kevin thompson yes no the loan and the business is inside our market footprint damon delmonte okay great okay and then with regards to the margin i think we are in a roughly  basis points of a benefit from the interest recoveries so if you look at like call it a orso as your core margin for this quarter kevin how do we kind of frame that going forward just given the two recent rate hikes and kind of what youre seeing on loan pricing kevin thompson right i do not see anything pushing it down at this point as the rate increases have been coming through that’s generally had a slight benefit to us as loans have repriced in the portfolio the pressure on the funding side has not been felt todate we are not sensing that there is anything imminent that’s going to change that either at this point so we think the margin should remain strong as we finish out the year damon delmonte so no change in the pricing dynamics like larger banks are changes the rates at all which is putting pressure on the smaller guys kevin thompson yes not anything that is affecting our business damon delmonte okay and then i guess just lastly with the insurance agency acquisition is first quarter still your seasonally high quarter for insurance i think can we  we can expect something in the  to ish  range for the next couple of quarters as like your normal run rate kevin thompson correct damon delmonte okay okay great that’s all that i had thanks a lot don hileman alright thank you operator the next question comes from daniel cardenas of raymond james please go ahead daniel cardenas good morning guys don hileman good morning dan daniel cardenas just a couple of quick questions here going back to the two nonperformers that were added on this quarter were those kind of from the legacy portfolio or were those from some of the recent acquisitions that you guys have completed don hileman no they were our origination not related to the acquisition at all one was – one of them i would categorize as a fairly new credit to us that had issues and that’s the one we took to chargeoff but that was we originated those kevin thompson not part of the acquisition at all daniel cardenas okay perfect and then with people pay could you maybe give us a little bit of color as to what impact if any thats going to have on operating expenses going forward don hileman it is in very minimal operating expenses it is just another service in our mobile and our electronic banking suite to allow customers more of a flexibility to pay individuals and other payments outside of electronic banking so they do not necessarily have to have an account with us to receive a payment now which is we think is a very – what we’re seeing in the industry and then something that was very convenient for our customers and theyve kind of asked for but the additional incremental expense is going to be very minimal daniel cardenas okay and then the – kind of the core operating expense number that we saw this quarter is that a good run rate to build off of for the second half of the year kevin thompson i would say yes absolutely we did have about  of onetime cost for the merger but as we finish out the year and continue to grow so i would expect that number very similar to what we had this quarter as we go forward don hileman yes we do have some additional facilities adds for expansion but that is going to be later in the fourth quarter so it really won’t affect our run rate here i think we mentioned we are going expand the facilities in toledo daniel cardenas okay great and then just kind of last question i know you guys just completed the commercial but maybe whats your appetite for additional acquisitions and then whats the market like right now in your footprint is there a lot of activity lot of noise or is it fairly quiet don hileman yes it is some place in the middle i would not say there is a lot of activity but there is activity there is still a lot of questions going on there is – we are receiving books to look at i would say our – the appetite is we feel good about our ability where we are today of absorbing csb with anything  we probably serve our people some are readying and some are saying “well let me digest and finish up some of the things i didnt get done before you want to do another one” but i think generally our organization feels good about what we accomplished with the csb we feel really good about the integration process the management of that integration and the corresponding results and like kevin said we are seeing those integration benefits right now so we will be receptive to looking at another transaction in the near term to – and if the outright opportunity comes along daniel cardenas okay great perfect thanks guys don hileman all right thank you operator the next question is from christopher marinac of fig partners please go ahead christopher marinac just wanted to ask a little bit more on the credit picture that beyond the comments said it earlier do you have a sense of kind of directionally what happens with substandard and classifieds when you file the key will those be directionally higher or was a lot of that sort of curtailed by taking the chargeoff in the quarter kevin thompson no they’ll be directionally higher due to these two adds they are going – they are both classified and substandard right christopher marinac okay and i may have missed earlier in your remarks about were those ci loans or what was the history on those two deals don hileman the one we took the chargeoff chris was the ci loan and the other one is cre christopher marinac got it okay so one of each all right don hileman one of each yes but the chargeoffs were related to the ci portfolio christopher marinac and then excluding those two credits are there other trends that you see that would indicate higher issues or just more downgrades in the future or again is these really isolated as you said don hileman i think there is early indications that the potential for more credit stress and we are not necessarily see in it and i cant say this credit and this credit but i sit in communities and we sit and talk about things a lot of that indications when we get the yearend financials coming in and some of those are a little  maybe not as strong as you would think in our environment so thats kind of an indicator that maybe things arent as strong as what you would hope so it is things like that chris it is not necessary to say that we are seeing obvious deterioration trends but i think we are maybe not seeing as much of the improvement with a hope to seeing based on getting in some of the yearend financials for some of our client set i would have hoped at this point in time kevin thompson i would agree with that comment but again i don’t know if anything that notes but the only area that might have anything in my mind is the ag that is – and even there our collateral positions are very strong and we do not see losses but we do see – the customers have had a little more distress if you will over the last couple of years so thats the only thing that maybe is a little bit of issue in my mind otherwise i do not think the trends are really very different than what we see christopher marinac and kevin as you mentioned ag it is not necessarily ag alone it is within for us to find us more that the customers has potential issues and that impacts other pieces of the portfolio is that the fair interpretation kevin thompson i suppose on a broader sense sure don hileman yes christopher marinac okay great and then i guess a separate question a different topic just on the people pay program did you have to pay survey per user or just curious if that ends up being a better economics for you than some of the other sort of and other things that the banks are starting to adopt don hileman well this is easier one for us at a lowercost entry point for us to get into this because of our relationship with our core provider and that made this an easier less costly relationship kind of a way to get into this  that market of the people pay chris we do  i believe we do have a set cost on this program by user but it is not as dramatic as some of those other ones that may be have more bells and whistles than our product but we are excited about at least having a good product that we can offer our customer and will continue to look at that but you would not necessarily match it up completely from a cost structure with some of those other products christopher marinac sounds great thank you for the back on there guys appreciate it don hileman all right appreciate it thank you operator operator instructions there are no additional questions at this time this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to tera
