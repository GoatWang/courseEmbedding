picks for best of chicago edit module edit module edit module kraft foods’s brand new world sanjay khosla learned to woo customers the oldfashioned way—by selling soap off a handcart in the countryside of india now at kraft foods khosla is hailed as a globalization guru his biggest win so far translating oreos into chinese by victoria lautman published june   page  of  “sanjay has changed the culture at kraft” says a colleague “before everyone drove their own agenda now the level of teamwork is so high that we’ve exceeded some ambitious expectations”  sanjay khosla is ruminating about “the journey” tossing out profound thoughts on trust belief the soul and human potential the quasiinspirational spiel is part deepak part oprah part obiwan but enlightenment is not on the table here we’re talking about oreos they may be the united states’ most popular cookies celebrating their th birthday in  but these days khosla has found his own history intertwined with that of the iconic treat since becoming president of the developing markets division for northfieldbased kraft foods in —ten years after oreos debuted in china—khosla has seen the brand ascend from unpopular bottom feeder to the biggest fish in the chinese cookie pond and in a country of over  billion people that’s a lot of cream filling “when i started at kraft four years ago oreos were doing so poorly in the chinese market that we were about to remove them completely” muses the yearold executive who was born and raised in india “i said ‘wait a minute why not try a different approach’” for khosla who oversees nearly  billion of business in over  countries “wait a minute” translated into a creative hubbub that included hundreds of oreo ambassadors on bicycles doling out samples in various chinese cities and the towering basketball star yao ming explaining in commercials the traditional “twist lick and dunk” technique for enjoying the cookie above all there was a massive overhaul that tailored the oreo to local tastes making it smaller and less sweet with nonwestern flourishes like greenteaflavored filling and wafer rolls today china is the secondlargest consumer of oreo products after the united states and khosla has clearly earned his transcendental cookie discourse for the moment let’s put aside questions about pushing a calorieloaded confection with little nutritional value on hundreds of millions of chinese children and consider khosla’s triumph with another aging american product tang in the united states the onetime powdered drink of nasa astronauts had also languished in kraft’s developing markets for years then it got the khosla treatment overhauled packaging innovative distribution and locally adapted flavors that put the original american orange to shame—lemon pepper pakistan tamarind mexico and soursop brazil today tang ranks as one of kraft’s most profitable products with sales growing  percent a year over the last two years even if few north americans seem interested in quaffing it khosla had earned stars as a marketing wizard well before landing at kraft though he had largely hovered under the radar that began to change last year when he took a major role in kraft’s noisy  billion acquisition of the venerated british candy maker cadbury a deal that counts heavily on kraft expanding its markets for sweets around the world then last fall khosla and mohanbir sawhney a professor at northwestern university’s kellogg school of management published a conventionbusting manifesto “growth through focus a blueprint for driving profitable expansion” distilling the strategies khosla has honed throughout his career khosla and sawhney’s recipe eschews complexity and mindnumbing powerpoint presentations in favor of a lessismore approach that would make mies van der rohe proud since publication of the article in the marketing magazine strategy  business the authors have been in demand at business schools and corporate meetings “i read ‘growth through focus’ and then invited sawhney as our keynote speaker to talk about it” says laura hackett general manager of commercial learning and development for millercoors “the idea that you can line up a company behind a few key priorities and will progress further or that companies don’t have to become more complex but can be stripped down for clearer focus    it’s very inspiring” of course none of this would mean much if khosla didn’t deliver in his own right but kraft’s developing markets business has more than doubled under his watch now representing  percent of kraft’s global portfolio leading the ceo irene rosenfeld to gloat “our developing markets business is the growth engine for our company we’re so glad sanjay now calls kraft foods his home” rosenfeld lured khosla from new zealand to chicago six months after she took over the helm at kraft in  when profits from the developing markets division were flat as a wheat thin at the time khosla was managing director of fonterra a large dairy cooperative headquartered in auckland “i was lying on a beach in paradise at the last bus stop on the planet when the call came in from freezing chicago with an offer i couldn’t refuse” he recalls i first met sanjay khosla socially oblivious to his lofty corporate status but captivated by his tales of übersuccessful marketing strategies he was like scheherezade in the arabian nights only his spooledout exotic narratives featured cookies and teas soaps and detergents one anecdote involved a prekraft european product he helped develop that targeted horny adolescent boys eager to attract girls khosla and his team figured out how to play on the boys’ desires as well as their insecurities inspiring them to douse themselves in body products with names like dark temptation and rise aromas that permeated my own home until recently when my son outgrew the phase these sagas seemed epic transformational subtly and delightfully fiendish but it’s safe to say that if there’s a kraft product in south america indonesia australia russia or any of the dozens of other countries in his orbit khosla has been losing sleep over it auguring how to sell it better

teams while handing blank checks to otherspodcast insight in person listen download interview feed itunes store more podcasts »how can your business achieve focused growth sanjay and mohan sat down with kellogg insight to discuss the sevenpart process “focus seven” that they develop in their book this interview has been edited for length and clarity for a longer version of our conversation check out the accompanying podcast kellogg insight sanjay you spent years in charge of developing markets for kraft foods can you explain some of the difficulties kraft was experiencing when you joined in sanjay khosla kraft has always had some phenomenal brands built over generations and some phenomenal talent and people one of the reasons it was underperforming at that stage was it was planting too many flags all over the world—probably doing too much and spreading itself too thinki mohan your experience as a consultant to both established firms and startups led you to a similar conclusion about the importance of focusing growth effortsmohan sawhney i saw a very similar manifestation of that problem with technology companies and that is what we call sku proliferation or product proliferation a small company like skullcandy that makes headphones has  models a company like microsoft creates literally tens of thousands of units of products and services a company like cisco goes into plus adjacent markets all at once—and then they start to stumbleso the problem is of complexity and lack of focus i found that a startup company can get unfocused before it has even a single product because there are so many opportunities before itki you advise companies “put your efforts where you have the best chance of winning big” how does this work upper management is being asked to predict the future that can’t be easykhosla the important part is to take a few bets one example is oreo the numberone biscuit in the world it’s  years old but for  years it was spectacularly unsuccessful outside the us we decided to take a bet on it we got a few people around the world working as a collaborative network and took a  million business and made it a billion dollar business in five yearssawhney it isn’t just prediction that management needs to do there are some scorecards we point out in our book what we call the three m’s that can help to prioritize where you’re going to place your bets those three m’s are momentum that’s where you’re getting traction in the marketplace where you’re getting market acceptance you’re finding that customers are responding to your value proposition margin can we make money how profitable is this opportunity is it above margins materiality how big can this be for the company if it’s a very interesting and highly profitable business but it’s really small it can only be two percent of your overall revenues—that’s not very materialki another phrase in your book involves tapping into a firm’s human resources you write that the same ideas that apply to strategy apply to people “bet on fewer people bet bigger on them and be bold in letting them run with their dreams” whom do you bet on and how do you set these employees up for successkhosla one of the phrases we use is “giving blank checks to people” i’ll give you a story of a colleague of mine george zoghbi who was running a global food service and dairy company called fonterra we gave him a blank check we gave him complete freedom to do what he wantedthe normal response to a blank check initially is skepticism it then goes to fear and panic you also realize if you don’t focus on a few things and do them well you’re not going to achieve anything in the timeframegeorge did a phenomenal job he met some impossible numbers in a short period of time he fell at times learned from it got up and moved on he has recently been appointed vice chairman of kraftsawhney one thing i would say is that these are not always the people who are in the obvious places in your organization so this is actually a key task of leadership to find the people who are emerging as stars there is a fair bit of human judgment involved in sitting face to face with somebody and saying that’s a person i’m going to take a bet on ever since i became familiar with sanjay’s use of blank checks i’ve been using that with the company that i’ve been advisingki as companies focus on new markets particularly international ones you stress the need to “go glocal” what do you mean by thiskhosla it’s very simple it’s a question of how do you get the balance right between hopelessly local and mindlessly global take the case of kraft china for years kraft invested a lot of money and got a lot of skills and people but it was caught in a vicious cycle of low growth low gross margins declining market shares and making no money more importantly there was no hope of making moneyso the approach that we took was be very clear about what needed to be done locally in china—things like sales market activation local product development—while leveraging the tremendous expertise in terms of procurement manufacturing and rd of a company like kraftsawhney what sanjay meant by “mindlessly local” is basically having a bunch of subsidiaries that are operating pretty much independently where you lose the benefits of scale but on the other hand if you’re “hopelessly global” then what you have is onesizefitsall and that’s in fact the problem that kraft had in china and the oreo cookies that sanjay was talking about they were not right for the chinese market they were too sweet they were too big they were too expensive but you wouldn’t know that you had to go to the villages and the streets of beijing and shanghai to figure out what the chinese consumer wanted it had to be the local talents so it’s really a combinationkhosla and then in terms of execution you need enough nimbleness and agility and flexibility to keep learning as you’re doing so in the case of oreo the team came up with things like green tea oreo and wafer oreo some of these new products failed and that’s fine so long as you quickly learn and move on but at the same time there was some great technology in terms of rd and processing cocoa that was then used in all these markets around the world to great advantageso the basic pieces of the focus seven model stand get strategy clear cocreate and align people around the world behind a simple idea be very clear about what the priorities are unleash the potential power of people to all the teams and then measure progresssawhney leadership just needs

leadership blank checks is all about trust trusting leaders to do the right thing to take ownership and yet be accountable for results how do these blank checks really work there are three guidelines the first is you select the leaders whom you really trust and the teams and give them a really big target let them dream big and these targets have to be achieved in a very short period of time the second is the leader and the team puts together a short business proposal asking for the resources that would be needed along with clear deliverables and milestones and the third guideline is to nurture these teams make sure that they have an environment where they can succeed and then monitor progress against milestones bumper case study oreo let’s take an example let’s take the case of oreo now oreo is the number one biscuit in the world by far oreo is over  years old but for  years oreo was spectacularly unsuccessful outside the us — and certainly not for a lack of trying so we called the oreo team and we said “we know currently it’s not doing well in countries like china and indonesia and various other parts of the world — it’s not doing well just figure out what do you want to do what resources do you want to use take a blank check and go” and then they realized why is it that it’s not selling so well in various countries around the world like china and they found that very often the american oreo was too sweet too big the price points were too different and they started experimenting then with a number of different products like green tea oreo wafers half these products failed and that was okay that was really okay because the whole idea here was to give them freedom within the framework of keeping the oreo essence core around the world but then getting local products which delight local consumers as a result of that blank check oreo went from a revenue of about  million dollars outside the us to over a billion dollars in revenue in six years more importantly gross margins outside the us were very healthy bumper three lessons from blank checks so what are the lessons that one can learn from giving blank checks and again this is equally applicable to small companies and large companies the first is you get people you trust people to do the right thing and you make them act as owners the second is that this signal of trust goes all over the organization of empowerment but yet they are accountable for results and the third is not all blank checks succeed very often they fail because if everything is going well something’s horribly wrong the important part there is if a blank check experiment fails not to penalize the leader or the teams provided they’ve learned the lessons from the project that again is a signal of trust — trusting people always to do the right thing and making sure then you celebrate not only successes but also celebrate and learning from failures over years of experimenting with blank checks we found that in companies you have a choice you can either be cozy or you can trust people and get them to fly view video load more the trust project at northwestern university contributors sanjay
