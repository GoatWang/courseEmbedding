the boston globe tweet share globe file  george scangos by robert weisman globe staff  july   the next chief executive of biogen inc will inherit a company that is financially sound and a powerhouse in multiple sclerosis drugs but the new leader will also be challenged by waning sales growth and limited nearterm prospects for new blockbuster products that was the view of analysts after the cambridge company said thursday that ceo george a scangos will step down in the coming months scangos  is credited with leading a turnaround in the six years since he took the top job at the largest masssachusetts biotech company advertisement scangos said more than once over the past year that he had no plans to retire in an interview he said his decision grew out of discussions with the company’s board that “got concrete relatively recently”“the board thinks it’s a good time for a transition” scangos said “i agree” get talking points in your inbox an afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news delivered weekdays sign up thank you for signing up sign up for more newsletters here biogen has recently installed new senior research commercial and technical operations executives as it prepares for a transition to a new era scangos will stay until biogen names a successor a process that could take four to nine months “george is leaving the company in good health” said eric schmidt a biotech analyst at investment bank cowen  co “but this company which wants to be a leader in treatments for neurodegenerative diseases has a lot of wood to chop to strengthen the pipeline”many on wall street say biogen needs to be more aggressive in buying smaller biotechs with drugs that can revive its growth prospects in the next five years as it presses forward with developing highrisk therapies for alzheimer’s spinal muscular atrophy and other neurodegenerative diseases for which there are now few if any effective treatments advertisement “the company is going to have to deploy capital to acquire the next wave of great drugs coming in the next few years” said michael yee analyst for the investment bank rbc capital markets if it doesn’t analysts warned biogen could become a takeover target itselfbiogen announced scangos’s planned departure along with secondquarter quarter financial results that showed revenue increasing  percent and earnings  percent from a year earlier the company also said it would buy back up to  billion of its common stock over the next three yearsshares of biogen climbed  percent thursday to in the interview scangos said he hasn’t had time to consider his plans but has no intention of retiring he said he’ll move to the san francisco bay area where his children and grandchildren live but will remain active in biotechnology and won’t rule out running another company“i’m not ready to sit on a porch with a mint julep or whatever people drink” scangos saidhe will also remain chairman of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america a national trade organization for the drug industry but he’ll leave that position when he leaves biogen because the group requires that its chairman be the head of a drug companya veteran biopharma executive who previously led exelixis inc in south san francisco calif scangos a native of lynn was named chief executive of biogen’s predecessor company biogen idec inc in june  the company’s board which had added activist directors upset with what they saw as an unfocused approach to research and development had asked his predecessor james mullen to resign raising questions about the company’s future scangos moved quickly to restructure biogen divest its idec cancerdrug division refocus its research on neurology and hematology and move its headquarters back to kendall square from suburban weston he also presided over the rollout of a halfdozen new drugs including the multiple sclerosis pill tecfidera one of three ms medicines in its portfolio that each generate more than  billion a year in saleslast october scangos unveiled a restructuring plan to cut about  jobs including 00 in massachusetts in recognition of biogen’s slowing sales growth and in may he disclosed plans to spin off its hemophilia drug franchise which sells two drugs to treat the bleeding disorder as a separate publicly traded company biogen’s earnings more than tripled and its revenue more than doubled during scangos’s tenure partly through product introductions and partly through price increases for existing drugs its stock price has surged more than  percent compared with a rise of about 0 percent by the nasdaq biotechnology index though it is down more than  percent from a year ago the company is now among the most valuable biotech companies in the united states with a market capialization of  billion biogen has the secondhighest market value in massachusetts after lab supplies giant thermo fisher scientific inc of waltham “george joined biogen at a very challenging time” biogen chairman stelios papadopoulos said in a company statement “he reorganized operations and he oversaw the enrichment of our product pipeline and the launch of several products”biogen’s growth over the next five years is projected to be slower than most biotech firms said max jacobs an analyst at edison investment research “their franchise is very focused on ms most of their products are old and they need something with nearterm potential to buttress them but it’s not clear what that is”ali fattaey chief executive of lexington biotech company curis inc who has known scangos since they both worked in california said he has mentored and inspired executives on both sides of the country “he’s a man who can create drugs for patients and focus an organization” fattaey said “i learned from him in that regard and that’s part of his contribution to the field”reflecting on his time as chief executive scangos said “i feel really good about my six years here i’m proud of the company we introduced six new drugs i think i’ve had an impact on the culture here and the way people work    there’s a lot of mixed emotions for me i love this company i love the people but it’s time to move on”robert weisman can be reached at robertweismanglobecom follow him on twitter globerobw real journalists real journalism subscribe to the boston globe today one free article

violent vietnam war protests he was sympathetic with the antiwar protests civil rights movement and other challenges to the establishment scangos says he didn’t have much direction then and just tried to have a good time but he also says he became a lot more socially aware “a lot has been written about the boomers about their unwillingness to accept the status quo the status quo was not good it was not a country where it was equal for everybody and not everybody had a voice” scangos says “to some extent it’s still not although it’s way better than it was i fit in well with a sense of iconoclasm and wanting to do things a bit differently” around the time when he was due to graduate in 0 his student deferment from the draft was about to expire he and a couple dozen friends huddled around a radio and listening in suspense as draft cards were drawn based on birthdays he drew a favorable number which meant he had gotten lucky and wasn’t going to be shipped off to southeast asia “that was a big night everybody went out and got drunk” scangos says “you either were happy you weren’t going or you were drinking because you were that was a dramatic time” after graduating from cornell scangos didn’t know what to do next he took an entrylevel job as a lab technician at mit stayed about a year and got bored the next challenge was as a sales rep for a lab supply company which gave him access to some of the top labs at harvard and mit and plenty of other labs in new england the science at those top institutions fascinated him even it was over his head at the time and he soon realized sales wasn’t for him “after about a year i really came to the conclusion that i didn’t care whose product these people bought our products worked a competitor’s product worked my life i thought was being wasted on spending all my time working on things that didn’t matter” scangos says so he got serious about learning biology and that meant graduate school he had good grades from cornell but the epiphany hit him in august  long after most fall classes were fully enrolled still he felt so strongly about this new direction that he got in his car with a copy of his undergraduate transcript and drove to umass amherst it was a school he thought he could afford and where he thought he could get started in microbiology he figured he’d probably transfer somewhere else after a year that all seemed reasonable until scangos ran into secretary who told him he was basically nuts trying to get in that late like when he was able to miss the draft scangos got another good break this time scangos says the department chair overhead the conversation and called him into his office scangos says he pleaded his case telling the professor he had good grades and strong recommendations and would be a terrific student the department chair listened then told him that a student had just dropped out creating a vacancy if scangos follow up with proof of recommendations and an official transcript he could be admitted as a provisional student for one semester with a chance for permanent enrollment if he did well that was all it took scangos had never taken a microbiology course at

boston who’s made good october  0 by george scangos ceo of biogen this week george scangos was named as one of the world’s ten best performing ceos by harvard business review in january the company he leads biogen idec was ranked as the  most sustainable company in the world beating out 00 companies with a market cap of over  billion he first made news as a young postdoc attracting notice as the cocreator of a transgenic mouse today he spends much of his time in an office about 0 miles from the working class greek neighborhood in lynn ma where he grew up you could say he’s come a long way in those 0 miles the kid who didn’t speak english until he went to elementary school and who didn’t get serious about biology until his mid0s is now leading new england’s largest independent biotech company “i’ve spent a lot of time here it feels like home in a lot of ways” says scangos  during this indepth interview with xconomycom at his office in kendall square in cambridge ma scangos’s path to the top job of one of massachusetts’ leading companies began in a lowermiddleclass section of lynn where his paternal grandparents had immigrated from greece and had settled down with what became a family of 0 kids there were about 0 cousins nearby some of whom still live in massachusetts scangos says his father was an accountant at what later became exxon while his mother stayed at home to care for george and one younger daughter the family spoke greek in the home and young george never learned english until it was time to go off to school scangos moved with his parents to connecticut when he was in elementary school and attended public schools there until it was time for college he says he didn’t work very hard at academics other than french class “you know how at the back of your high school yearbook where it lists people who were the best at various things” scangos says “i had two of those one was in typing which has turned out to probably be the most useful skill i learned in high school the other was in french i won the award for the best french student in the state” he went on to win scholarships to attend cornell university he thought about majoring in french and only took science classes to fulfill graduation requirements even then he was initially planning to take physics until a classmate urged him to try biology because it was easier “i hated bio in high school didn’t have a good teacher” scangos says “i had to be talked into it” freshman biology at cornell as taught by the professor and textbook author william keeton was “unbelievably good” scangos says it was interesting enough for him to take another class in genetics which he found similarly fascinating so that was the end of french—scangos was hooked on biology specializing in courses that concentrated on the neurological basis of behavior things like fight vs flight response to be at cornell in the mid0s meant that scangos was exposed to some serious and occasionally violent vietnam war protests he was sympathetic with the antiwar protests civil rights movement and other challenges to the establishment scangos says he didn’t have much direction then and just tried to have a good

harvardtrained biologist the work he was given was challenging enough that scangos never felt the need to transfer he got his doctorate in  as genetic engineering was picking up after getting his phd scangos set off for postdoctoral work in the lab of renowned geneticist frank ruddle at yale university scangos’ claim to fame as a young postdoc was when he and another of ruddle’s charges jon gordon created the first mouse with foreign dna that could be passed on to offspring—a transgenic mouse this was an historic advance which made the front page of the new york times and the major newsmagazines scangos was in baltimore when the times’ story broke interviewing for a faculty job at johns hopkins university ruddle was in europe “i got a call from frank and he said ‘you better get back to new haven there’s going to be a big press conference’ i had no media training what did i know as a postdoc but i got on a train to back to new haven there were 00 reporters asking questions” gordon got most of the credit for the advance but it didn’t hold back scangos’ academic career he took a faculty job in biology in  at johns hopkins where he stayed full time for six years the biotech business was gaining momentum in the early to mids but scangos was only dimly aware of it as proof he says he and gordon didn’t file any intellectual property claims on the transgenic mouse work the lure of biotech finally got to scangos in  his old mentor ruddle was part of a team starting a company originally called molecular diagnostics in new haven with financial backing from bayer scangos took a yearlong sabbatical from hopkins to join them “i had a safety net i could try it and if it was awful i could say thank you very much and go back” to hopkins scangos says once he resettled in at new haven with people he knew from his earlier days in the ruddle lab he was hooked “it was so much fun the science was really good we did very highlevel science i thought it was compelling to try to develop drugs not just for the knowledge but to use it for a practical purpose” scangos says so he stayed resigning his faculty position colleagues in academia predictably weren’t pleased but scangos didn’t look back within three years by  he was tapped for bigger things invited to come get some international experience at bayer headquarters in germany the goal for bayer was to have scangos help modernize its labs there while also offering him some valuable management experience by this time scangos and his wife had two young daughters and his wife was finishing her doctorate and embarking on her own career so there were factors to consider besides his own advancement scangos remembers discussing the move after the kids went to bed only to be peppered with a bunch of questions by his yearold who knew something was up scangos says his daughter wanted to know how long they’d stay  years he promised whether the schools were good yes whether they’d come back to new haven yes and whether they’d move back into their old house yes family approval was secured two years later as promised scangos was back in the us taking on increasingly bigger roles in bayer rd by the mid ’0s bayer was increasing its bets on biotech and the place to be was berkeley ca scangos’ older daughter was entering high school and his younger daughter was entering junior high they extracted a promise if they moved to california no more moves until after they graduated scangos agreed a couple years later the human genome project was starting to rev up huge amounts of information was transforming biology and scangos says he didn’t think pharma companies were in position to take advantage of it once again the action was in academia and biotech in  he was wooed to lead a cambridge mabased startup called exelixis that was seeking to industrialize genetic research by knocking out genes in fruit flies to see what effect that had on disease processes the thought then was that this would provide valuable information for drug development scangos loved the concept but didn’t like the fact that exelixis was in cambridge he had promised his daughters he wouldn’t leave california so soon he declined the move but the board wanted him so badly that exelixis moved to california—almost all of its  employees anyway—to set up shop with scangos at the helm there it was at exelixis that scangos cut his teeth as a biotech ceo raising money recruiting talent and switching strategy when it became clear that selling information wasn’t as good a business as developing drugs over the next  years scangos oversaw the building of a broad and deep pipeline of new cancer drugs and struck a number of big pharma partnerships scangos initially says he wasn’t interested when a recruiter called him to gauge his interest in being ceo of a large independent biotech company in boston but the recruiter persisted saying the board really wanted to meet scangos scangos ultimately warmed up to the board’s pitch after all few biotech companies ever get to biogen’s position with thousands of employees a multibilliondollar valuation several drugs on the market lots of infrastructure for science and manufacturing loads of cash in the bank and a long history of profits and the kids were out of the house so that was no longer an issue “it’s such a unique company and a unique opportunity i figured i’d be crazy not to take it” scangos says the story of biogen’s renaissance since scangos took over in mid has been welltold he made a big round of cuts in his first few months recruited a couple of wellrespected former ceos to his senior management team and decided to move biogen’s headquarters from the suburbs back to cambridge next to the company’s scientific core and where it had been until just before he took over those moves reflect a philosophy that scangos has been forming on his journey he’s been around long enough to know that drug development is a major gamble despite all the advances in our understanding of biology one minute you might be the hero while the next minute people will be calling for your head to hear him talk about how he approaches decisions he sounds pretty humble he quoted another former mentor of his from bayer “horst mayer once told me ‘as you rise up in management you know less and less about more and more then you become the ceo and you know nothing about everything’” scangos says “what he meant by that is you have to recognize the limits of your own knowledge” that means a scientist like him needs to recognize that other people know more about things like reimbursement sales marketing and manufacturing a ceo at a big company like biogen needs to oversee all of it defer to the subject experts but also have a good “bs filter” as he put it “you have to have big picture you have to know the issues and you have to ask tough probing questions” those who work with him closely say his leadership style has also played a role in bringing renewed focus to biogen “george’s leadership style is open welcoming of input and fairminded in his decisionmaking he has the ability to be your peer and your manager in a simultaneous and seamless fashion” says fran heller who previously worked for scangos as head of business development at south san franciscobased exelixis “he is often referred to as the most lovable ceo in our industry and deservedly so”     george scangos the boy from working class boston on his road back to lead biogen idec the story of biogen’s renaissance since scangos took over in mid has been welltold biogen has mounted a turnaround during his first year as ceo this was no small feat given that scangos was hired to be a change agent at a company that hadn’t introduced any new marketable drugs since
