international us  roszel road princeton new jersey  httpwwwtycocom ■ edward d breen took over as president and ceo of the troubled tyco international in july  made notorious by scandals that included questionable accounting practices and former ceo dennis kozlowskis unwarranted personal use of company funds tyco had become known as one of americas most corrupt companies according to industry analysts breens reputation as a man of honesty and integrity as much as his standing as a successful worldcaliber executive at both general instruments and motorola landed him the position at tyco edward d breen getty images  proves capabilities at general instruments breen grew up in suburban pennsylvania and attended grove city college a small christian school just north of pittsburgh he began his career with general instruments gi where he sold cable television converter boxes breen was successful enough as a salesman to be appointed senior vice president of sales at gi in  in this position he oversaw the worldwide sales organization for the companys terrestrial products an organization that encompassed sales personnel and activities in the united states canada latin america europe and asia pacific breens managerial capabilities led to a series of appointments as the head of several subdivisions at gi including the broadband networks group and eastern operations for the communications division he was eventually appointed executive vice president of terrestrial systems where he directed the sales of terrestrial products worldwide and managed the divisions strategic business units including the distribution and telephony units in  he took over the reins as chairman and ceo at gi during his career at gi breen was credited with many of the companys successes he led gi through the digital broadband revolution and expanded the companys market share in cable settop boxes according to one of his former bosses at gi hal krisbergh breens salesmanship led the company to dominate the cable settop box market which expanded from  million to  billion within  years one of the keys to breens success in this area was his ability to persuade customers to sign up for multiyear contracts which effectively shut out rivals in an interview with john kador for electronic business  krisbergh noted stars shine early and ed breen was no exception february  a short stint at motorola in january  motorola bought gi primarily because the former company had been attempting to enter the broadband business without much success after the merger breen was named executive vice president of motorola and president of the companys broadband communications sector he quickly set out to integrate the two companies cable businesses having established himself as a key executive within motorola breen was made head of the companys network sector in october  he was named motorolas president and on january   he assumed the additional duties of coo over time breen acquired a reputation for instituting costcutting and other programs to make operations more efficient and effective for example when he first joined the company he promptly disposed of overlapping modems and discontinued unprofitable models during his time at motorola breen was credited with playing an instrumental role in leading the company back to profitability tyco calls although he was seen as the heir apparent to motorolas chief executive christopher galvin in late july  after seven months as coo breen decided to accept the job of ceo at the troubled tyco international he had previously turned down the top jobs at lucent technologies and nortel networks corporation industry insiders were surprised by breens decision to take over the helm of a company that not only was carrying  billion in debt but also was suspect for its overly acquisitive growth strategy some analysts speculated that breens decision had more to do with personal ambition than with dissatisfaction at motorola where the ceo was many years away from retirement age breens reputation soon caused tycos stock to soar  percent adding  billion to its market value within two weeks of the announcement of his taking over the position of ceo he quickly developed specific plans to further repair the reputation of the company in lightwave  breen was quoted as saying that one of his top priorities was to restore confidence in tyco with our employees suppliers customers and the financial community and enhance and strengthen the core businesses october  one of the first steps he took toward this end was to oust most of the top personnel from the previous administration in an interview with len boselovic for the pittsburgh postgazette  breen noted i went in with two thoughts i needed to replace the board and i needed to replace most of the senior management november   despite breens belief that some of the companys directors were worth keeping investors persuaded him to make a clean sweep he eventually replaced the entire corporate board and  of tycos top  executives he also created the monitorial position of senior vice president of corporate governance breens next move was to start clearing up tycos financial mess which included  billion of debt and a market value that had declined by some  billion by the time he assumed control of the company part of breens plan for mending tyco was to shift the companys growth strategy away from dependence on acquisitions toward maximization of the profitability of existing businesses he focused on reducing the companys debt load in part by selling off some of the holdings the company had obtained during its overly aggressive acquisitions binge on november   breen announced his intention to sell tyco global network a  billion undersea fiberoptic network that had been built during the height of the telecom boom he also produced plans to sell  smaller businesses and lay off  of  employees and he greatly reduced executive compensation limiting bonus payouts for executives to  million in  compared with the  million executives had received the year before breens announcement of these strategies drove tycos stock up  percent on november   to  the highest price the stock had reached since he took over management style emphasizes integrity according to industry analysts breen had many attributes that make a good manager in electronic business  his former boss krisbergh noted he is quickly able to identify strategic impacts of decisions he recruits well and he can manage large organizations through major technical innovations february  breen was also well regarded for his willingness to cut losses and abandon projects that he saw as being ultimately unprofitable breen had had a reputation for being able to change the dysfunctional aspects of a companys culture which was one of the main reasons he was hired by tyco hightech market analysts note that breen had the hustle and conviction to make a bet on products and then program and move forward quickly breen also placed a strong emphasis on customers—some analysts say to the point of reverence perhaps the greatest aspect of breens importance to tyco was his integrity as evidenced by traits such as his dislike of ostentatious management perks in a place where the former ceo notoriously had spent  on a shower curtain although he received a high salary for his duties he was modest by nature and told melanie warner in an interview in fortune that when he first saw his own office which included a kitchen the size of some new york city apartments he thought this is embarrassing april   he has since moved the corporate headquarters from new york city to more spartan facilities in new jersey ralph whitworth of relational investors summed up breens qualities to warner in fortune this way ed is full of energy and has impeccable integrity april   the battle continued breens effort to restore tycos image and profitability was an ongoing battle as the securities and exchange commission and the internal revenue service continued to probe tyco in  concerning accounting improprieties nevertheless breen remained confident that he could spur tyco to regrowth his goal was to increase earnings by  to  percent to approximately  billion in  he said that once tycos operations had become more efficient he would look back into the prospect of making acquisitions see also

leadership tyco’s edward breen when leadership means firing top management and the entire board nov   north america twitter facebook linkedin google email print comment quote twitter facebook linkedin google email print comment quote supports kws leadership content edward d breen understood that he was taking on one of the toughest jobs in corporate america when he agreed to become chairman and chief executive officer of tyco international in july  the former ceo had resigned and was under investigation for stealing hundreds of millions from the company then hours before breen was to announce his new position cnbc reported that tyco might file for bankruptcy the company’s stock fell  that day “i knew i was going to be in the fire” breen recalled during a recent talk on campus as part of the wharton leadership lecture series “but you never know the intensity until you are really there” intensity may be an understatement tyco was on the list of notorious companies gripped by greed and accounting fraud along with enron worldcom and global crossing its former ceo l dennis kozlowski has since been sentenced to up to  years in new york state prison for plundering the company in addition to a top layer of managers with questionable ethical bearings tyco was saddled with debt and struggling to integrate  acquisitions made during the previous five years breen dug in he fired  of the company’s top  executives then he turned around and fired the board that had just hired him he closed tyco’s posh manhattan offices and moved to west windsor nj he ordered consolidations throughout the company paid down debt and lately has begun to focus on growth rather than simple survival breen told his audience that the courage to make decisions — right or wrong — along with the talent to both cut expenses and increase revenues are the hallmarks of a great chief executive and most important he said managers need to show passion and compassion to lead successfully “i keep in mind that any problem can be resolved it might be ugly but that’s the mindset i went into this with i’m not afraid to make decisions and i’m not afraid to make a few mistakes along the way” today he manages a company with  billion in revenues and  employees worldwide tyco operates five main businesses fire and security including the adt brand electronics healthcare engineered products and services and plastics and adhesives making the tough decisions at  breen was already a seasoned executive when he came to tyco as president and chief operating officer of motorola breen had made painful cuts following a dropoff in technology spending after  prior to that he had engineered the buyout of general instrument corp which he had joined fresh out of pennsylvania’s grove city college and where he rose to become chief executive in  at age  his experience at those companies gave him the confidence to take on deeply troubled tyco he thought “okay so it’s just a bigger problem… it’s not as if i’m a gambler” breen said “i went in thinking ‘ i can pull this off  i can’t’ whether it was logical or not that’s the way i thought” the situation at tyco required swift and bold decisionmaking he noted “as a leader you need to be willing to make the tough decisions it’s not always pleasant it’s not always easy but at the end of the day we’re paid to fix problems the higher in the company you are the more problems you hear about” according to breen too many corporate executives are so fearful of making a bad decision that they study and analyze a problem until they become completely stymied that can be just as bad for a company as a wrong decision typically eight out of ten decisions turn out to be right he estimated and one of the two others can probably be fixed breen said his decision to sack his entire top management and board made life difficult but was necessary to restore credibility to the tainted tyco name “people were concerned that we weren’t going to make it it was decisions like this that started to tell people it was a new day — that we were serious it set the tone that gave us the breathing room to fix the company” breen’s most immediate problem was  billion in debt — including  billion due in the next  months the stock’s downward spiral following the bankruptcy rumors pushed the company out of compliance on loan agreements “a lot of things happen you don’t think about” he said “our accounts payable skyrocketed our suppliers asked us to pay cash or cod you owe  billion and there is no cash in the bank the system was seizing up on us we had some big customers and it is amazing they stuck with us” the cnbc bankruptcy report he added was plausible “it wasn’t happening but there was some semblance of truth that it might” the company pared down operations closing  facilities amounting to  million square feet of real estate “what we realized was there’s a lot of waste here we said ‘we can make it profitable just by focusing on the waste while we try to grow the company” breen recalled growth would need to come from within at least for a time  “a lot of management people around the world love doing acquisitions i said ‘no acquisitions for three years’ that wasn’t a pleasant conversation for people i wanted the company to be operationally fixed then when we add acquisitions on top of it we have the right systems in place” after severing the company’s entire top management breen hired outsiders to perform specific jobs in his early days at tyco “it’s very difficult at our size and complexity but what we did was rent a department” he hired accountants lawyers and a public relations firm to manage the company he also commissioned an executive recruiting company to serve as tyco’s human resources department “i had a cadre around me of very senior respected talent that had been through many wars in their lives what i liked about it was nobody got rattled” when it came to remaking the tyco board breen pointed to the arrival of jack krol former chairman of dupont co and jerome york who had worked with kirk kerkorian at chrysler corp as critical ingredients “once i had those two things started to fall into place and we got to build the team” given the company’s scandalous recent past breen focused intently on building new governance structures “a leader needs to be transparent if you’re not it will catch you over time” he noted adding that sometimes doing the right thing is not even good enough “the leader must not only always do the right thing but the leader must be perceived to be doing the right thing” underlings too have responsibilities “a point we stressed more than other companies — because of where we came from with the problems a few people had created — is that there’s a leader imperative and a follower imperative” said breen “if you see something you don’t like ‘speak up’ that’s important for you that’s your integrity in life and that’s vitally important for the company going forward” by his second year at tyco revenue was up from  billion to  billion and net income was up from a  billion loss in  to a profit of  billion in  passion is number one once tyco was stabilized breen could begin to think about growth “a lot of ceos are great at coming into companies and cutting costs” he pointed out “i love that part and for a lot of ceos that’s what they know is within their control and it improves the numbers” other ceos have the opposite bent “some think ‘grow grow grow’ and they have an inefficient company but to me the great ceos get the operating intensity piece and they also get the growth piece they are not mutually exclusive” at tyco the company has a clearly defined growth plan he said and managers are asked to invest for growth and are measured by their success tyco executives are often asked whether the company’s divisions would be stronger on their own “that’s the ageold conglomerate question” said breen “you have to be really honest with yourself and constantly ask that question what is the corporate shell adding in value otherwise the divisions should be on their own” breen noted that in most of the recent business debacles companies wound up working their problems out in bankruptcy court enron worldcom and global crossing all filed for bankruptcy court protection not tyco “what normally happens in a case like tyco the company has to file for a prepackaged bankruptcy that’s how you get out of these problems i’m really proud we never did that” said breen although “we got close” after paying down tyco’s debt breen said some investors are now concerned the company is not leveraged highly enough he recalled that following a call from analysts his staff had asked him why he didn’t lay out more details about how the company will deploy its cash to defuse analysts’ concerns “it felt so good to hear that question” breen told them “i wanted to hear it a few more times” breen stressed that ceos and managers at all levels must feel passion and compassion “these are the two words i always keep in my mind even though they might seem like soft words coming from a hardhitting ceo” whenever he interviews a job seeker breen can tell within five minutes if the candidate possesses a passion for work “if they have passion you see it in their eyes it’s just something that bubbles up passion to me is the numberone thing” compassion is also important he said especially in today’s business environment where ethics are more appreciated than in the prebreen days at tyco “as you move up you need to be a team player you need to care about other people if you don’t you won’t move up… believe me people see they know who the team players are and who the individual players are” breen recalled an early meeting with employees where a woman stood up and said she was embarrassed to wear her tyco tshirt to her child’s soccer games he had to tell her “i don’t blame you” breen estimated tyco is now in the third inning of a turnaround that will take nine innings but he is starting to see employees wearing tyco shirts when he visits corporate locations “our employees went through the depths of despair through no fault of their own” he said “and they are happy to be back” supports kws leadership content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to quote for
