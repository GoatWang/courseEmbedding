or a joint inventornot applicablebackground of the invention technical fieldthis invention relates to recycling containers background artcited us patent documentsjuly mongiellojune morganfebruary lewisnovember hart bjune delmerico bapril sholinder bdecember dembowiak options for recycling containers that allow visibility of its contents available currently include very simple inexpensive and portable models as in fig —unit types  and  more complicated and expensive and somewhat less portable units as shown in fig —unit type  and much more complicated and expensive units like in fig —unit type  which are not readily portableeach of these options forces the user and the producer to make the following tradeoffs visibility of the contents protection of contents from weather and use security of the recycling materialscontents long term rigidity and durability of the unit from weather and use or general use or abuse simplicity of assembly for the user or producer cost to design and manufacture the parts and the product ultimately the cost to the userthe models shown in fig —unit types  and  have excellent visibility of the contents and are very low cost are easy to assemble but are not ideal for applications for continuous long term use because they have poor structural rigidity fig —unit type  does protect the contents from weather while in fig —unit type  does not do so at all neither one of them does anything to address the security of the contents either to the manufacturer obviously the cost to produce are pretty low although there is specialized tooling required to form the parts these tradeoffs make these units best for temporary use were lowest cost is important and for areas where weather and tampering of the contents are not important factorsthe next design shown in fig  unit type  is more robust than fig  unit types  or  with regard to securing its contents but is at a higher expense while the design does show its contents it is less visible than the prior two designs because the wire mesh interferes with visibility while better than unit types  and  shown in fig  tampering with the contents is possible and weather protection is still very limited also due to the nature of the assembly it is not very rigid and this type of unit design and manufacturing is more costly than the prior designs assembly for the user is more complicated although would probably still be considered relatively simple the tradeoffs here limit this design to moderate levels of duty where security is somewhat important and relatively long periods of use are requiredfig —unit type  is similar to fig —unit type  but improves upon protecting and securing its contents but with significant reduction of visibility of the contents at a much higher unit cost and more complexity for the user or producer to assemble the product the cost to design the product is also much higher and the manufacturing cost will be relatively high as well and specialized specific to this product the rigidity is improved substantially but the assembly requires the use of hardware this requires the assembler to be able assemble and line up the holes and then install the hardware which may work loose also it is general practice in the industry that units like this are sent to the customer preassembledfig —unit type  uses a channel cutout in the plasticpolymer components for putting a clear panel for protecting its contents while maintaining visibility to its recycling contents this unit can provide good protection from weather and from intrusion on the contents from the side like unit type  the unit is moderately rigid and durable and likewise is held together by hardware or specialized components development design costs and manufacturing costs are much higher than the other unit types  also it is general practice in the industry that units like this are sent to the customer prefabricatedfig —unit type  conceptually is very similar to unit type  in that it uses a channel to capture the panels in this case the panels and structure are made of polycarbonate which use forming and other specialized processes that are very expensive and only cost effective in the highest of production volumes the units are fairly rigid and the components of this type snap together or use hardware or specialized components or a combination of bothin general for the “enclosed” units some variations of unit type  and unit types  hardware is used and is the key to the “part to part” structural strength and rigidity and of the overall units themselves andor “snap together” and other specialize hardwarecomponents are used hardware usage in general requires holes hardware tooling and the alignment usually of multiple components at the same time to properly fit the pieces together further even with the typical use of locking hardware split lock washers inner and outer star washers etc fasteners tend to become loose and may even corrode these fastener solutions also concentrates stress forces caused by the use environment such as wind or weather or people pushing leaning sitting or placing objects on the units applied to the unit at the hardware or joints of the assemblies this causes wearing out of the components or rounds out or strips threaded holes or weakens the components that hold the units together at the jointsthe recycling container disclosed in us pat no  is a typical recycling container design modified for a new application in this case the design adds an aperture to the side panels to provide visibility for inspecting the recycling container contents while this provides some visibility to the contents the remaining construction substantially obscures the view requiring a close proximity to inspect the contentsthe number of parts for the design is still quite complex difficult to assemble and costly to manufacture the components proprietary nature also further adds to the cost to manufacture this recycling container the recycling container is constructed including an internal structure as means to collect recycled materials in addition to the external structure this extra internal device adds cost and complexity to the recycling containerthe design requires mechanical hardware such as screws and bolts which are unreliable tend to come loose concentrate structural forces at said hardware locations and prone to stripping or corrosion due to wear and use in the environmentthe recycling container disclosed in us pat no  is similar to us pat no  in cost complexity and restricted view this design provides a means for advertising on the recycling container this addition requires yet more hardware complexity and costtherefore it is a primary objective of the present invention to greatly simplify the means to produce and assemble a recycling container while preserving the features of visibility robustness and performanceit is a further objective of the invention to provide greater visibility of the contents allowing inspection from a significant distance from the recycling containerit is a further objective of the invention to provide a recycling container wherein signage or other displayable can be added without additional hardware fasteners or complexityin accordance with the present invention a recycling container in its simplest form may contain five different parts corner connectors vertical frame poles horizontal frame poles for the top and bottom frame structure panels and a high friction material as a “gasket”there exists a need by consumers for a recycling receptacle with high visibility to its contents with protection from weather and tampering and security of the contents placed in the unit with long term rigidity and durability by eliminating the hardwarejoint design weakness simplicity and ease of assembly with minimal use of tooling and hardware at a reduced cost compared to the higher end units fig  unit types  and  to make this available to consumers producers need a low cost means for designing and manufacturing of the product design and manufacturing is straight forward requiring general equipment saws mills other cnc or non cnc type of tooling versus highly specialized costly equipment and tooling that is often product or part specific and use readily available parts and materials that eliminates or minimizes design manufacturing or rd coststhe present invention shown is a recycling receptacle which has the following benefits maximizes visibility of the contents by using clear panels and a slim yet strong frame contents are protected by polycarbonate panels or similar clear panels which are securely contained in the channel in the structure of the frame rigidity and shock absorption is created by using strong materials which use a high friction created by the gasket material inserted between the panels and frame structure simplicity of assembly is achieved by eliminating hardware or specialized connectors and using readily available corner connectors that can be pressed or hammered into place with a common rubber mallet or framers clamp panels simply drop into place within the track of the frame and the gasketglazing can be installed with ones fingers or a straight edge design and manufacturing costs are minimized by using common architectural aluminum corner connectors and flat rectangular pieces of polycarbonate materials and readily available gasket material tools for cutting and mitering aluminum are common and basic and readily available the same is true for cutting polycarbonate panels design allows for shipment in a disassembled state—further reducing cost to deliver the product to the consumer customized sizes and shapes are readily achievable at minimum incremental cost extreme ruggedized versions are readily achievable at minimum incremental cost units are easily adapted to other applications customized signage or repaired through simple replacement of side panelsbrief summary of the inventionthe present invention provides an optimal solution that maximizes visibility of the contents while creating a rigid durable shock absorbing structure at minimal cost where prior solutions required a consumer and manufacturer to compromise on these factors the present invention solves these compromises by using high friction gasket material inserted between panels and frame structure without use of hardware or proprietary components or materials or specialized tools to assembly or manufacture the present inventionbrief description of the several views of the drawingfig  is an isometric view of the preferred construction of the present invention in which the above advantages and features are clearly disclosed as well as others which will be readily understood from the following description of the illustrated embodimentfig  is an isometric view of one example of other alternative constructions of a recycling center in accordance with the present inventionfig  is a crosssectional views where the top most view depicts the preferred location of the gasket materials for the preferred embodiment of the invention the other views show alternative constructions of the embodiment in accordance with the present inventiondetailed description of the inventiona recycling center in accordance with the present invention is generally portrayed in fig  in fig  the assembly referred to as “assembly” consists of a triangular top sign referred to as “sign” a lid referred to as “lid” with two cam locks referred to as “lock for lid” of which one is on the hidden backside top surface of lid which is not fully visible and a single hole opening referred to as “insertion hole” for depositing recyclables four clear panels referred to as “clear panel” a structure referred to as “structure whole of framing and connectors” consisting of eight threeway high durometer corner connectors referred to as “connectors” of which four are obscured by the lid and are not visible that connect each of the  metal frame tubes referred to as “frame” and where the top of the frame is obscured by the lid together the frame consists of  metal frame tubes referred to as “frame” with four not visible under the lid each with uchannel shaped flanging for capturing the clear panel and high friction gasket materials referencing fig  the base of the recycling center consists of four identical metal frame tubes where the four frame tubes are connected together by a high durometer threeway corner connector being inserted into each of the frame tubes once assembled the base frame of the structure forms a square an identical such assembled frameconnector square which is not shown since it is obscured by the lid is the top of the structure the top and bottom assembled frameconnector squares are connected to four identical vertical frame tubes that are similar to the base frame tubes except that they are longer by inserting said tubes onto the heretofore unused flanged of the three way corner connectors the assembled whole of the framing and connectors constitutes the said “structure” but the top part of the structure frameconnector square is not installed until the panels are inserted into the uchannel first each panel consists of an inside and an outside the outside of the panel faces the outside of the recycling container and the inside of the panel faces the inside of the recycling container on the outside perimeter of each of the four panels a high friction gasket material is applied to each of the four panels to their entire outside perimeter where it will contact the inside face of the uchannel flange that captures it this gasket material is the width of the uchannel flange on the frame and no wider the four panels are inserted into the uchannels of the partially assembled structure consisting of the bottom frameconnector square and the vertical frame tubes that are connected the top frameconnector square is then installed so that the top edge of the clear panels inserts into the uchannel part of the top frameconnector square and the unused flange of the corner connectors are inserted into the vertical frame tubes on the inside interface between the clear panel and the uchannel of the frame ie inside the recycle container structure interior additional high friction gasket material is inserted by pressing into the interface around the complete inside perimeter of each panel by finger or straight edge thereby compressing all gasket materials on the inside and outside perimeter of the panel in the uchannel a lid is on top of the said structure and is secured to the frame of the structure by two cam locks and lid has a triangular sign that is secured over the opening a base pan is secured to the bottom inside edge of the flange by double sided industrial tapefig  depicts an alternative embodiment of a recycling center in accordance with the present invention whereby the structure and base pan is identical to that of drawing the lid lock and sign are deleted from this construction and replaced by a top referred to as “hinged top” that is connected by a hinge the hinged top is comprised of eight threeway connectors referred to as “connector”  opaque panels with an insertion hole in each panel referred to as “opaque panel with insertion hole” for inserting recyclables one panel on the top side of the hinged top and  frame tubes referred to as “frame” whereby the frame tubes are connected together with the threeway connectors in the same fashion as they were in the description for fig  and the panels gaskets and panels assembled in the same fashion as the description of fig  with the result of the structure shown as the “hinge top” in fig referencing fig  the top example of a cross section view depicts the methodology used in fig  where the referenced “gasket material adhesive applied to panel” is applied to the outside perimeter of the panel before the panel is installed and the referenced “gasket with additional ribbing to grab extrusion lip” is applied to the inside of the panelflange interface after the panel is installed the other examples depicted in the bottom portion of fig  shows other alternatives to the preferred embodiment referenced in fig  in one case as shown in the bottom portion of fig  a uchannel gasket material is used and on the second flange only  gasket material is usedfrom the foregoing description it will be apparent that the invention provides a greatly improved and very advantageous recycling container construction as will be understood by those familiar with the art the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof   previous patent apparatus for
