advertisement supported by business day pound your fist if you must but make me listen corner office by adam bryant june   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story this interview with paulett eberhart president and chief executive of cdi an engineering and technology professional services firm was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq were you in leadership roles early ona after i graduated from college i was hired as a billing office supervisor of about  peopleq that’s a big step for a first management rolea it’s one of those moments where you show up at the right time and they needed someone and i think my college education was important to them i had the good fortune of working for a woman who taught me a lot most of the people who worked there were older than me and they certainly had a lot more experienceso how do you deal with that you have to learn to become very humble and you have to recognize that they know a lot more than you do i spent a lot of time walking around getting to know them spending time sitting with them learning what they were doing how they were doing it i think they appreciated that advertisement continue reading the main story q you said your boss at the time was a good mentor how soa she knew that i really wanted to learn i was dedicated and i was working really hard i have found that if people think you’re working really hard and trying then they’ll spend extra time with you i learned very early that you’ve got to ask for help you’ve got to go in and say “look i’ve got this situation and i’m not sure what to do i want to run it by you” if people think you’re really trying they’ll go the extra mile to help you continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q tell me about some aspects of your leadership style todaya i tell my team that i expect them to be very honest brutally honest with me but in a respectful way i like to have strong people around me and they have to be very open and very honest and very candid so you can’t just tell me once and assume that i grasp itif it’s critical and important you’ve got to come back you’ve got to tell me you’ve got to come into my office and shut the door i don’t care if you have to pound your fists on the table and say “paulett i don’t think you’re comprehending it i want your full attention listen to me this is what i am telling you” we at a minimum need to discuss it or whatever the situation isand so i encourage them to be very aggressive with me because i work and i run at a fast pace and sometimes you have to stop and take five minutes you’ve got to invite them in and sit down and say “ok what are the issues you’ve got my full attention let’s talk about it”q you were brought into your current company to turn it arounda the board decided it needed someone from the outside who could bring more of a growth culture which is a lot of what i like to do i like transforming businesses and then figuring out how do we get a new strategy and start really growing a lot of that goes back to my early days at eds because we grew so quickly there photo paulett eberhart president and ceo of cdi an engineering and technology professional services firm wants her team to be brutally honest with her if the issue is important she says youve got to come into my office and shut the door credit chester higgins jrthe new york times q what have you done to change the culturea i was surprised to learn how many people in the company really didn’t know the company’s history so i had some people recreate the history and we put together a video because i think it’s good to know the past that leads you into the futurei also saw a company that had really talented people but they didn’t really talk to each other a lot they were in different silos and there were actually a lot of silos given the size of the company one of the things i heard from talking to our clients is that people from cdi don’t even know who each other are that told me we weren’t maximizing our opportunities with the client newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking

privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime so we tore down a lot of the barriers and really got people to think that if it’s good for the client and good for cdi then we’ve got to figure out a way to make it happenthe other thing that i really focused on was accountability you have to be accountable for your actions and if you sign up to hit an objective whatever that objective may be then the rest of the organization and your client or whoever else it may be are counting on you to hit that goal i felt we needed to push that more culture is a hard thing to change it takes a long time but you’ve just got to keep repeating things and practicing what you preach advertisement continue reading the main story q  i’ve heard a lot of leaders talk about the importance of repetitiona people don’t spend enough time communicating people love to know what’s going on and you’ve got to keep communicating day in and day out sometimes i’ll think i’ve said this so many times — surely people would get it but then you’ll go into a meeting and you’ll think wow ok they don’t get it yet so we’ve got to continue reinforcing itq how do you hirea i try to get them to talk about what’s not on their résumé part of it is just getting a sense of the person i’ll say that we’ve all had a lot of successes in our life but we’ve had some things that we’ve learned from as well so what are some of thoseand i’ll ask them “if i were to talk to a group of people who’ve worked for you in different roles what would they say that’s good about you and then what are the two things they would change about you” and so it’s not so much about the answer — it’s just how thoughtful were they about it and were they really honestq what career advice do you give peoplea i think accountability is important people have to be able to count on you to deliver on what you committed to deliver whatever that isi also talk to people about what i have learned in my career and what i would do differently in some areas one of the things i should have done earlier in my career is network more i thought just keep your head down and keep working and everything will work out and i’ve done well so i have no complaintsbut the advice i give people is to really keep those networks alive and truly stay in touch with people continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this
