recreational cultivation license in oregon  newswire futureland corp futl progressing toward its first recreational cultivation license in oregon futureland enters the billion dollar oregon cultivation market press release  aug   denver colorado august   newswirecom  ​​​​​​​futureland corp otcqb futl a leading provider of strategic real estate investment grow facilities and solutions to the global cannabis industry provides an update on its progress and direction of the company originally futureland corp’s primary focus was on pursuing land leasing opportunities in states such as colorado and washington  however realizing the enormous opening of the medical and recreational cannabis sectors we decided to expand the scope of business to include medical and recreational cannabis cultivation   looking to the future it seems natural to include the purchase of dispensaries and infused product licenses where vertical integration is possible while not all states currently allow publically traded companies to have ownership futureland foresees that opportunity for ownership is on the horizon and stands ready to take full advantage  initial expansion efforts are already underway with initial advances just outside the city limits of grants pass in southern oregon futureland corp purchased  ownership of  acres from hspendleton llc together with john miller of groovy groves plans are underway to file for a recreational license in josephine county and build out a recreational grow facility with a fully integrated supply chain which consists of a sophisticated onsite cultivation facility and its portfolio of proprietary strains the estimated forward proforma month gaap revenue for grants pass oregon will be over  million  based in oregon grants pass is strategically positioned to capitalize on the recreational cannabis market in oregon which is expected to significantly expand in  and  todays announcement is a continuation of that vision and i am confident this acquisition will enable futureland to achieve rapid growth for the benefit of its stockholders says ceo mr cox “also our partners already have another site  miles away from grants pass where they possess a recreational cultivation license and about  acres in wolf’s creek oregon  futureland holds a first right of refusal on the property and opportunity the purchase of this property alongside grants pass will increase our estimated forward proforma month gaap revenue from  million to  million” concludes mr cox always seeking additional advances the company has not stopped looking at opportunities in jamaica california other parts of oregon washington kentucky hemp canada puerto rico and more  included in this are some targeted acquisitions that could set the stage for an uplist to a higher exchange  additionally futureland is still working closely with hemptech otc htco and tinkerer’s obsession labs to get  grow pods placed around the us and canada for native tribes

the companymarketwiredjanuary  reblogsharetweetsharedenver comarketwired  jan    futureland corp  otcqb  futl  a leading provider of strategic real estate investment grow facilities and material solutions to the global cannabis industry announces today a renewed and revitalized vision and direction for the company ceo cameron cox explainsfutureland became a public company in mid after spinning out of futureworld corp fwdg a cannabis incubator since that time a few things have become abundantly clear to us first we need to be where the plant is we need to touch the plant rotate the plant and posit the plant into the marketplace while at the same time finding a way to syphon out all the goodness it has to offer meaning that how great and to what extent the various parts of the plant can aid with many human ailments on the pharmaceutical side have yet to be determined but more and more data is pointing to the fact that we are just beginning to scratch the surface and this work needs to be donefutureland began with the idea of land leasing and grew into a need for cultivation and an eye for extracts and dispensing we believe that a focus on the plant is key to our future success in addition to these very important components to our business model we are also looking to add a few items that compliment it in fantastic ways it is futurelands belief that the science of genetics as it pertains to cannabis and to mapping out the pharmaceutical exchange which is now underway will play a very important role for future industry control the company has this very much in the forefront of its mind as it plans its growth and targets strategic acquisitionsthe company has identified specific categories of business that we intend to drill down on and develop in this race the first leg of our journey is land currently we hold  separate parcels  acres in colorado  acres in oregon and another  acres in oregon we believe in real estate and the value of this limited commodity as an investment and its ability to provide us with access to grow marijuana the second leg is licensing particularly licensing to grow marijuana and to dispense the product to the people who need it and want it futureland currently owns a license in oregon for cultivation and is planning to make application for a second license soon in the same state the third leg is extracts and all that they entail meaning cbd and thc infused edibles and drinks naturally futureland will need licensing for the thc this market has taken off in recent years and we believe that there is plenty of room for futureland corp the fourth leg is cannabis supplements which is not yet a welldefined category in the space but we intend to flesh this out in the coming months the fifth leg and perhaps one of the most important is biosciences both genetics and deliverythe company is preparing to build something great and with the growth of any powerful company personnel will need to be added we want to start off by getting some very good people on our advisory board to help us keep our attention on the prize at the end of the race  to help shepherd the company to facilitate effectively everything it envisions for its future growth we will begin assembling that team in coming weeksthis is what futureland is about this is what we will be engaged in while building the company and this
