county the “derivative action” against each of the other directors of the company including ellen and margaret cotter for breaches of fiduciary duty including the duties of loyalty care andor disclosure and for aiding and abetting fiduciary breaches mr cotter amended his complaint twice adding allegations about subsequent events dismissing one by then former director without prejudice and adding as defendants two individuals subsequently added to the company’s board of directors the “board”   the pending second amended complaint the “sac” in the derivative action alleges that certain of the director defendants including ellen and margaret cotter threatened to terminate mr cotter as president and ceo of the company if he did not enter into an agreement with ellen and margaret cotter to resolve the trust litigation on terms satisfactory to them which terms included making margaret cotter the sole trustee of the reading voting trust the sac further alleges that after mr cotter failed to acquiesce to the threats of termination certain of the director defendants terminated him as president and ceo of the company the sac further alleges that when ellen cotter was appointed interim ceo upon the termination of mr cotter as ceo she pressured mr cotter to resign from the from the board by falsely claiming that his executive employment agreement required him to do so and by threatening to terminate certain employment benefits including the health and medical benefits the company then provided mr cotter and his family if he did not resign from the board when mr cotter did not resign ellen cotter terminated such benefits and caused the company to commence an arbitration against him as described under “employment arbitration” below   the sac further alleges that individual director defendants acted to entrench themselves in control of the company including by forcing a noncompliant director to “retire” and by adding to the board two persons with no experience in the company’s businesses or as directors of a public company who were family andor personal friends of ellen andor margaret cotter the sac alleges that certain director defendants acting as members of the board’s compensation committee in derogation of their fiduciary duties authorized ellen and margaret cotter as executors of the estate to exercise the option to acquire  shares of class b common stock that the company previously had reported to be held by the trust the sac also alleges that ellen and margaret cotter failed to make timely and accurate sec filings and caused the company to make materially misleading if not inaccurate sec filings in furtherance of the alleged entrenchment scheme   the sac also alleges that in late  and early  certain director defendants including margaret cotter aborted the then ongoing search using an outside recruiting company to find a new permanent ceo of the company and then with the other director defendants appointed ellen cotter as ceo notwithstanding the fact that she did not meet the search criteria previously agreed to and used to identify ceo candidates the sac also alleges that the director defendants in the spring of  made margaret cotter a highly compensated senior executive at the company responsible for development of its valuable real estate assets in new york city notwithstanding the fact that she had no prior real estate development experience                the sac further alleges that the director defendants failed to take actions sufficient to make an informed good faith decision in response to a cash offer by third parties including patton vision to purchase all of the stock the company at a price in excess of the price at which it traded in the open market and instead rejected the offer and refused to engage with the offerors because that is what ellen and margaret cotter indicated that they wanted   discovery in the derivative action is substantially complete certain writ proceedings are before the nevada supreme court and no trial date presently is set   employment arbitration   on july   the company filed and served a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association under mr cotter’s employment agreement entered into on or about june   “ employment agreement” by the arbitration the company seeks declaratory relief determining “that mr

dismissing one by then former director without prejudice and adding as defendants two individuals subsequently added to the company’s board of directors the “board”   the pending second amended complaint the “sac” in the derivative action alleges that certain of the director defendants including ellen and margaret cotter threatened to terminate mr cotter as president and ceo of the company if he did not enter into an agreement with ellen and margaret cotter to resolve the trust litigation on terms satisfactory to them which terms included making margaret cotter the sole trustee of the reading voting trust the sac further alleges that after mr cotter failed to acquiesce to the threats of termination certain of the director defendants terminated him as president and ceo of the company the sac further alleges that when ellen cotter was appointed interim ceo upon the termination of mr cotter as ceo she pressured mr cotter to resign from the from the board by falsely claiming that his executive employment agreement required him to do so and by threatening to terminate certain employment benefits including the health and medical benefits the company then provided mr cotter and his family if he did not resign from the board when mr cotter did not resign ellen cotter terminated such benefits and caused the company to commence an arbitration against him as described under

“retire” and by adding to the board two persons with no experience in the company’s businesses or as directors of a public company who were family andor personal friends of ellen andor margaret cotter

the estate to exercise the option to acquire  shares of class b common stock that the company previously had reported to be held by the trust the sac also alleges that ellen and margaret cotter failed to make timely and accurate sec filings and caused the company to make materially misleading if not inaccurate sec filings in furtherance of the alleged entrenchment scheme   the sac also alleges that in late  and early  certain director defendants including margaret cotter aborted the then ongoing search using an outside recruiting company to find a new permanent ceo of the company and then with the other director defendants appointed ellen cotter as ceo notwithstanding the fact that she did not meet the search criteria previously agreed to and used to identify ceo candidates the sac also alleges that the director defendants in the spring of  made margaret cotter a highly compensated senior executive at the company responsible for development of its valuable real estate assets in new york city notwithstanding the fact that she had no prior real estate development experience              the sac further alleges that the director defendants failed to take actions sufficient to make an informed good faith decision in response to a cash offer by third parties including patton vision to purchase all of the stock the company at a price in excess of the price at which it traded in the open market and instead rejected the offer and refused to engage with the offerors because that is what ellen and margaret cotter indicated that they wanted   discovery in the derivative action is

actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or underlying our forwardlooking statements are the following with respect to our cinema operations o the number and attractiveness to movie goers of the films released in future periods o the amount of money spent by film distributors to promote their motion pictures o the licensing fees and terms required by film distributors from motion picture exhibitors in order to exhibit their films o the comparative attractiveness of motion pictures as a source of entertainment and willingness andor ability of consumers i to spend their dollars on entertainment and ii to spend their entertainment dollars on movies in an outside the home environment and o the extent to which we encounter competition from other cinema exhibitors from other sources outside of the home entertainment and from inside the home entertainment options such as “home theaters” and competitive film product distribution technology such as by way of example cable satellite broadcast dvd rentals and sales and so called “movies on demand” with respect to our real estate development and operation activities o the rental rates and capitalization rates applicable to the markets in which we operate and the quality of properties that we own o the extent to which we can obtain on a timely basis the various land use approvals and entitlements needed to develop our properties o the risks and uncertainties associated with real estate development o the availability and cost of labor and materials o competition for development sites and tenants and o the extent to which our cinemas can continue to serve as an anchor tenant which will in turn be influenced by the same factors as will influence generally the results of our cinema operations with respect to our operations generally as an international company involved in both the development and operation of cinemas and the development and operation of real estate and previously engaged for many years in the railroad business in the united states o our ongoing access to borrowed funds and capital and the interest that must be paid on that debt and the returns that must be paid on such capital o the relative values of the currency used in the countries in which we operate o changes in government regulation including by way of example the costs resulting from the implementation of the requirements of sarbanesoxley o our labor relations and costs of labor including future government requirements with respect to pension liabilities disability insurance and health coverage and vacations and leave o our exposure from time to time to legal claims and to uninsurable risks such as those related to our historic railroad operations including potential environmental claims and health related claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos or other substances now or in the future recognized as being possible causes of cancer or other healthrelated problems o changes in future effective tax rates and the results of currently ongoing and future potential audits by taxing authorities having jurisdiction over our various companies and o changes in applicable accounting policies and practices the above list is not necessarily exhaustive as business is by definition unpredictable and risky and subject to influence by numerous factors outside of our control such as changes in government regulation or policy competition interest rates supply technological innovation changes in consumer taste and fancy weather and the extent to which consumers in our markets have the economic wherewithal to spend money on beyondthehome entertainment given the variety and unpredictability of the factors that will ultimately influence our businesses and our results of operation no guarantees
