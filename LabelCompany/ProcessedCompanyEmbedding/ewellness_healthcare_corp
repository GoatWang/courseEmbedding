stock being registered for resale by the selling stockholders named in this prospectus we may however receive proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of the warrants if all of the outstanding warrants were exercised for cash at an exercise price of approximately  per share subject to adjustment we could receive up to a total of approximately  however the holders of warrants are only obligated to exercise such warrants for cash if the underlying warrant shares have been registered for resale under a current registration statement declared effective by the sec under the securities act of  as amended and there can be no guarantee they will exercise any warrants we intend to use any proceeds we may receive from the cash exercise of the warrants for working capital and other general corporate purposes there is no assurance that any or all of the warrants will ever be exercised or that additional shares underlying the warrants will be registered for resale to date we have not identified any other program that is designed to provide distance monitored physical therapy telemedicine program that has been specifically designed to help prevent prediabetic patients from becoming diabetic although we compete against typical brick and mortar physical therapy practices they are limited significantly by the number of patients that can be seen in an  hour shift and do not offer any telemedicine products the national average is approximately  patients per day per physical therapist “pt” or pt assistant “pta” once we launch our dmpt services our pts and ptas are anticipated to be as high as  patients per day we anticipate being able to deliver up to  more patient volume per pt and pta additionally existing telemedicine physical therapy businesses do create and sell exercise videos but such business is not insurance reimbursable and there is little patient engagement accordingly we believe that we are firsttomarket with the innovative service and program we seek to provide company description ewellness was incorporated in nevada in may  following a share exchange we completed in april  pursuant to which ewellness corporation a nevada corporation became our wholly owned subsidiary we abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing ewellness corporation’s historical businesses and proposed businesses our historical business and operations will continue independently ewellness is an earlystage los angeles based medical technology company that combines digital physical therapy with progressive inhome exercise programs that includes active realtime monitoring and assessment by physical therapists our services are provisioned through our distance monitored physical therapy dmpt program utilizing our proprietary wwwphziocom telemedicine platform initially to prediabetic cardiac and health challenged patients through contracted physician practices and healthcare systems and inoffice visits based on today’s insurance landscape our main revenue source shall come from a combination of inoffice and telemedicine visits amid ongoing challenges and changes within the healthcare industry telemedicine is emerging as an increasingly attractive tool for delivering quality medical services as of the date of this registration statement we have one patient who is fully monitored on our wwwphziocom platform with limited insurance reimbursement to date however our wwwphziocom platform is fully operational we have completed an week patient inhouse study in los angeles and as of april   we are provisioning our wwwphziocom program to patients in los angeles through a cooperation agreement with evolution physical therapy “ept” to date we have not identified any other program that is designed to provide insurance reimbursable distance monitored physical therapy telemedicine that has been specifically designed to help prevent prediabetic patients from becoming diabetic and therefore believe that once adequately funded we will be the first to market with our specific innovative service and program our program combines inoffice directcontact physical therapy evaluations reevaluations and physical performance testing with an online telemedicine exercise program this business model allows us to bill for traditional inoffice patient visits and when insurance companies allow for our telemedicine exercise program sessions too we also intend to offer to enroll our patients in a nocost online healthy living nutrition and meal planning platform to be developed in the second quarter of  assuming we receive sufficient financing to do so we intend to start servicing patients in the second fiscal quarter of  in the los angeles metropolitan area when we also anticipate rolling out our wwwphziocom platform as an innovator of certain services we are aware that the proposed dmpt services will be launched in an industry with deeply established and regulated billing approaches for this reason we designed a business model to succeed in the current billing environment by anticipating that the only reimbursement available to us for the next three years will be generated by using procedures and codes that insurance providers currently accept even though we believe insurance companies will start providing more telemedicine reimbursement prior to such time given its benefits currently depending on each patient’s insurance coverage existing codes cover up to  inoffice visits andor up to  remotely monitored physical therapy sessions during our sixmonth program today some insurance companies do not reimburse for any physical therapy sessions whether or not they are monitored and none of the insurance companies within our patient base provide codes that reimburse nonmonitored physical therapy sessions our plans and goals factor in these nonreimbursed sessions as part of the overall cost of goods sold cogs we still believe that we can earn revenues and generate profit based solely on the services for which insurance companies currently provide reimbursement in light of current insurance practices we configured four separate reimbursement plans designed to maximize the needs of today’s patient base our dmpt system is currently configured to deliver a sixmonth therapy program with at least three sessions per week using a combination of  remote monitored andor remote nonmonitored therapy sessions and  to  inoffice visits number of office visits depend on insurance coverage this assures us that we will be able to deliver a consistent service to the patients and achieve our internal operating goals without any innovation in the insurance industry codes while the current somewhat archaic reimbursement standards do not reimburse for some aspects of our six month program based upon feedback from industry leaders we believe that the regulatory and insurance environment is trending towards a payment structure that will be more favorable to remote monitored and nonmonitored programs within the telemedicine sphere although there can be no guarantee such trend will be realized part of our current plan is to compile six months of compelling patient outcomes in the form of a clinical study to submit to the insurance agencies to encourage the trend towards remoteservices based reimbursement and enhance our reimbursement opportunities regardless our business model suggests that we will be able to generate revenues and sustain a profitable business however there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate any revenues or realize any profits as we have yet to launch any of our services if the insurance industry recognizes the advantages telemedicine can provide to patients medical professionals and insurance companies and then more readily provides reimbursement for same we will stand to earn significant more revenues our distance monitored physical therapy “dmpt” program including design
