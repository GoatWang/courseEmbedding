company today provided a product update for vibativ® telavancin the companys proprietary fdaapproved bactericidal oncedaily injectable lipoglycopeptide antibiotic the company detailed plans for additional vibativ clinical studies its strategy for increasing the scope of us commercial efforts and new study analyses presented at recent scientific conferences underscoring vibativs in vitro potency and activity todays announcement is being made in conjunction with the th interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy icaac being held september   in washington dcvibativs proven efficacy against difficulttotreat infections has been demonstrated in several large multinational registrational studies which involved one of the largest cohorts of patients with methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa infections studied to date given the increasingly urgent need to combat the growing public health threat of antibacterial resistance we are undertaking a proactive program designed to expand vibativs product profile strengthen physicians awareness and increase their utilization in the right patient populations said frank pasqualone senior vice president development and operations at theravance biopharma our plans to conduct a phase  registrational trial in staphylococcus aureus bacteremia a large observational use patient registry study a targeted and strategic expansion of our us commercialization efforts and to build a global network of partnerships to commercialize vibativ worldwide provide clear evidence of our ongoing commitment to building vibativs success and playing a leadership role in the broader antiinfective marketvibativ is approved in the us for the treatment of adult patients with hospitalacquired and ventilatorassociated bacterial pneumonia habpvabp caused by susceptible isolates of staphylococcus aureus when alternative treatments are not suitable and for the treatment of csssi caused by susceptible isolates of grampositive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus both methicillinsusceptible mssa and methicillinresistant mrsa strains vibativ which was discovered and developed internally is a bactericidal oncedaily injectable lipoglycopeptide antibiotic with in vitro potency and a dual mechanism of action whereby telavancin both inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and disrupts bacterial cell membrane functionphase  registrational study in staphylococcus aureus bacteremiaas part of its effort to explore additional potential infection types in which vibativ may offer patients therapeutic benefit theravance biopharma plans to initiate a phase  registrational study for the treatment of patients with staphylococcus aureus bacteremia bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream and represents a serious medical condition that can lead to the spread of infection throughout the body as well as the potentially fatal conditions of sepsis and septic shock the condition represents a significant unmet medical need with only two antibiotic treatments currently approved for bacteremiatheravance biopharma believes that vibativs demonstrated in vitro potency dual mechanism of action and efficacy in resolving difficulttotreat infections position it as a potentially medically important treatment for staphylococcus aureus bacteremia it is important to note that vibativ possesses a dual mechanism of action which differentiates the product from the two singlemechanism antibiotics currently approved for staphylococcus aureus bacteremiathe registrational trial will be a multicenter randomized openlabel study and is expected to enroll its first patient by the end of  the study is designed to evaluate the noninferiority of vibativ in treating staphylococcus aureus bacteremia as compared to standard therapytelavancin observational use registry tourtheravance biopharma is also planning to conduct an observational use registry study designed to assess the manner in which vibativ is used by healthcare practitioners to treat patients by broadly collecting and examining data related to vibativ treatment patterns clinical effectiveness and safety outcomes in the real world the company aims to create an expansive knowledge base to guide future development and optimal use of the drugread morenamed telavancin observational use registry tour the study is designed as a multicenter observational prospective study that will enroll approximately  patients from about  sites in the us as a noninterventional study all treatment decisions will be at the discretion of the patients healthcare provider the company is targeting enrollment of the registrys first patient in the fourth quarter of commercial program expansionduring the past year theravance biopharma has undertaken a carefully planned phased commercial strategy for vibativ in the us this strategy has focused on a limited number of geographic territories across the country and has succeeded in achieving the goals of the company therefore theravance biopharma is undertaking a targeted expansion into additional regional territories by the end of the decision to expand is informed by the companys analysis of treatment patterns in its initial target markets interactions with healthcare practitioners have shown that as they gain more experience with vibativ their utilization of the treatment expands to broader usage in the products approved indicationsexpanded clinical data supporttheravance biopharma is committed to conducting important research designed to further elucidate the potential therapeutic benefit and utilization of vibativ results from several new study analyses that further supplements the welldocumented evidence of the drugs in vitro potency and activity were presented recently at the th interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy icaac and the  international symposium on staphylococci  staphylococcal infections isssicombined data from these presentations confirm the previously demonstrated in vitro potency of vibativ against a broad collection of difficulttotreat clinical pathogens using a revised fdaapproved susceptibility testing method these data demonstrated greater in vitro potency for vibativ as compared to vancomycin against a variety of difficulttotreat isolates with reduced susceptibility to the approved antibiotics vancomycin daptomycin and linezolid these isolates included a range of staphylococcus strains such as mrsa mssa vancomycinresistant staphylococcus aureus vrsa and methicillinresistant staphylococcus epidermidis mrse as well as various biofilmrelated infectionsfurthermore in a number of in vitro studies results with the revised testing method indicated that the activity of vibativ is greater than previously reported providing a new reference for the drugs potencytheravance biopharma believes that these latest findings combined with previous study results provide confirmation that vibativ is a key alternative for patients in those instances in which vancomycin is not effective or appropriate for treating infections that are susceptible to vibativ therapytheravance biopharma is dedicated to patients requiring antiinfective therapy and committed to investigating the potentially broad utility of the compound as is well documented in the medical scientific and popular media there is a critical need for antibiotic research and development given the growing threat from resistance to current therapies and we believe that vibativ will play an important role in helping to address this serious medical problem stated rick e winningham chairman and chief executive officer we are proud to be the only company to discover develop secure approval for and commercialize a currently available branded antibiotic product this demonstrates that theravance biopharma is not only committed to the antiinfective area today but has been for nearly two decadesabout vibativ® telavancinvibativ® was discovered by theravance in a research program dedicated to finding new antibiotics for serious
