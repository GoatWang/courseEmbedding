especially important for project managers find out why decisions and dilemmas project management is driven by decisions often dozens or more per day some decisions are small and barely noticed while others are prominent some require deep thought because they involve people resources and the environment and sometimes these factors are in conflict creating a dilemma and perhaps significant risks while project managers normally know what to do how to do it can become a puzzle — especially when stakeholder interests conflict like all leaders project managers build trust by the way they make decisions here again the “how to do it” can be puzzling yet is instrumentally important ethics is the discipline of “how to do it best”  to guide behavior and help with tough decisions we’ve crafted a

refers to paints shininess when deciding on paint sheen consider the condition of the wall and whether the area is highlow traffic heres a partial list to get started flat or matte sheen provides great depth of color and is ideal for lessthanperfect surfaces eggshell pearl and satin sheens are light easy to clean work great in high traffic areas and reveal color with a softly polished glow
