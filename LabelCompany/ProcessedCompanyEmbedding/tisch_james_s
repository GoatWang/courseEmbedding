james s tisch the president and chief executive of loews corporation are giving  million to the new york public library to expand and strengthen its education programming from early literacy classes to technology trainingthe tisches’ gift will create a position for a director of education reporting to the library’s president tony marx while whoever is hired for that job will ultimately shape the vision for how to use the gift dr tisch said in an interview that she hoped the library would be able to expand popular offerings like english language classes as well as to add job training courses afterschool homework help and programs aimed at exposing students to the rich holdings of the system’s four research centersin the digital era libraries are increasingly becoming community centers where people come for many reasons including for classes or simply to access the internet“if we get the right director and hopefully we will” dr tisch said “this becomes a blueprint for what urban

potential to build out what early literacy and family literacy is”for example a pilot program being offered at the inwood library in manhattan called the bilingual family literacy breakfast program provides workshops to parents of prekindergarten students at a local school about how to supplement what their children are learning at home most of the parents are spanish speakingthe library system

the standards and the evaluation system led to a massive test refusal movement since dr tisch left the board last year the regents have begun to undo some of her legacy lowering standards for high school graduation and preparing to eliminate one of the new teacher certification examsdr tisch has not commented on the board’s actions and she did not break that streak in an interview this week instead she laid out a new political agenda for herself she said that along with her gift she planned to push the mayor to increase funding for the library system so that more branches can open on sundays currently only eight of the system’s  locations are open seven days a week almost all others are open six days as a comparison dr tisch pulled out a print out of programs at the scarsdale public library showing its long opening hours including evenings monday through wednesday and five hours on sunday advertisement continue reading the main story “you don’t need to be a genius to know
