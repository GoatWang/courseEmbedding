and strong of limb burlingame is a multipurpose font family that started out as a single typeface with a more specialist purpose there’s a clue in the name it was originally intended for a game identity it has found a wider purpose following pioneering investigations by monotype into the legibility of vehicle displays the research revealed a set of optimum criteria for dashboard display fonts large counters and xheights simple shapes and a loose spacing of characters  … more a search of monotype’s own library turned up nothing that fitted the bill exactly so carl crossgrove was asked to develop his game font burlingame with its open clear shapes into a family of faces that could meet the highperformance demands his refinements increasing the xheight loosening the spacing and paring down the corners improved the clarity and led to a design in two widths and nine fine weight grades suited to a wide range of uses from packaging and publishing to game and motion graphics glyphs refined for clarity suited for diverse use highly legible at small sizes optimized for displays striking characters strong headlines clear numerals for tabular use  except as otherwise noted
