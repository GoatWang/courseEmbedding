taco in part one of this discussion we left off with the questions how do you set yourself up for a victory with local field law enforcement and avoid the courts moreover how do you not get caught up in national housing issues remember that hud reference which will cost you nothing but time money and heartache let’s jump right into it with the old adage “if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it’s probably a duck” translated if you are running a campground that looks like a mobile home park and functions like one expect to be treated like a mobile home park especially when it comes to your field law enforcement and the courts what are some specifics to remove you from the duck mobile home  trailer park category and get you to looking more like a swan transient  tourism venue if you have no agreement governing your extended stays that’s a problem if you are using a standard ‘rental agreement’ that also puts a landlordtenant bullseye on your back you should adopt some form of site services agreement and embrace the mentality that you are providing monthly service hookups water sewer electric and not ‘renting a site’ furthermore if you have some form of a minipost office set up in your front office and you receive daily mail for your guests not tenants that is problematic  if the primary address you have on file for your guests is your park – that’s a big nono please tell me your guests don’t have your address on their driver’s license – yikes that’s an eviction nightmare waiting to happen even if you aren’t doing the things i just described and you are trying to run a good transient operation there are some pitfalls out there remember our conversation about the latest hud law where it is now a federal violation to discriminate against someone by not allowing extended guests in your park if they have criminal backgrounds under the recent obama administration they decided that there are an unfair number of folks being incarcerated and therefore an unfair number of folks being discriminated against who have criminal backgrounds so now if you use any form of an application format you cannot simply decline a guest not tenant because they have a criminal
