point to success for sean e reilly of lamar advertising company     lamar advertising company ceo pensacola fl founded  lamar advertising’s story of success began with the dissolution of a business partnership and a coin flip that awarded a simple pensacola fl sign company to charles w lamar it was considered to be the losing end of the deal but over the years this onetime small family business has been the leader in innovative ideas and concepts for the industry and ceo sean e reilly has been at the epicenter of its evolution among his accomplishments sean has overseen the acquisition of notable advertising firms debuted digital printing created an emergency alert system that displays amber fbi fema and other emergency alerts led the energyefficient transformation for billboards that now house solar panels and led lighting and introduced and promoted roadninja lamar’s free interstate travel map all while producing d billboard enhancements that have revolutionized the outofhome display advertising market sean is a staunch believer in empowering lamar’s management team establishing a flat organizational structure that vests autonomy for decisions about pricing newsite development hiring and operations among its  local managers with limited oversight from lamar’s management team the message it sends is that lamar trusts its managers to make the right call ultimately cultivating an organizationwide entrepreneurial spirit that extends well beyond family leaders cumulatively these actions have helped to firmly establish lamar as a member of the “big three” in outofhome advertising who really lost that coin flip   entrepreneurs make a difference  ey  united states ey client portallibraryabout usour valuesour global approachour leadersglobal
