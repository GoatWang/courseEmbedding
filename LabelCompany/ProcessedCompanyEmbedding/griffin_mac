or a couple of larger cables and the biggest anchor can hold thicker cables like those for cameras and other electronics the weight of the guide bases will keep them in place but theres also a nonskid

contact support support videos test test imic setup for mac how to convert vinyl to digital in garageband using imic downloads final vinyl manual pdf format download final vinyl for mac os x  and  download imic manual pdf format download can i connect two imics will they work at the same time pc input   you can connect them windows should see both imics and you can choose between them you cannot currently input from both simultaneously output   the popularity of dj software has resulted in an increasing number of programs that will allow you to use the imic output as a cue device those programs allow you to select both imic usb audio system and via audio wave and assign them separately currently that is only possible in programs that have been configured to do so i think ive installed it correctly but i cant get sound pc go to startcontrol panel and open sounds and audio devices click on audio and verify you’ve selected imic usb audio system under sound playback be sure you have your computer’s internal speakers selected as your output or playback device if you’re having problems recording also verify you’ve selected the imic under sound recording if you’re still not getting sound go to start programsaccessoriesentertainment and open sound recorder choose new under file click the red record button and speak into your microphone you should see the green line move in sound recorder actually the representation of the waveform click on play and listen to what you’ve recorded you can also double check your audio settings by going to audio properties under edit at this point you’ve verified the imic is working if you’re having further problems check your software manual or contact the manufacturer when using my usb hub the imic disappears mac and pc every manufacturer of usb gear wants you to plug their product directly into the computer and they usually state the device may or may not work well with all usb hubs in general the way to troubleshoot hub problems is to remove the hub make sure the device is working and then reconnect to the hub generally a powered hub which has its own ac power supply will work fine what is the imic is it a microphone mac imic is not a microphone but rather an inputoutput device using a mm jack that lets you connect standard audio products such as microphones headphones home stereo equipment vcrs musical instruments and virtually any other linelevel or miclevel audio device it’s basically a “sound card on a cable” that allows you to record and play digital audio using your usbequipped computer some computers like the macintosh ibook g cube titanium powerbook and numerous pc laptops rely on usb for complete audio support others have limited or no audio hardware for these computers imic can be used for audio input and output is the imic a digital input is it bit khz mac the imic is an ad analog to digital converter and a very good one for the price it will convert your analog input signal to digital and vice versa on output the imic itself does all internal processing at bit resolution but the mac os currently has a more narrow range of options topping out at bitkhz third party usb asio drivers will allow the imic to support up to bit resolution what macs can i use the imic with mac the imic is compatible with any mac that has builtin usb ports and is running mac os  or later as for earlier versions of os x the imic will probably work but you may need an earlier version of final vinyl or other recording software contact us if you need a version of final vinyl not available on the imic support page note usb audio should be supported from os  on we’ve had reports of successes and failures in  and you may or may not be able to accomplish what you want in that version does the imic support input and output at the same time mac and pc the imic’s inputs and outputs always work at the same time so no configuration is necessary what software drivers do i install for the imic mac you do not need to load any external drivers for the imic to work in os x all of the software that drives the imic is built right into the mac os so no other software is required for it to be seen by the operating system there is no software in the imic that transfers to your computer what kind of software can i use with it mac virtually any software capable of playing or recording audio on your mac should be compatible since the imic uses the mac’s builtin audio drivers most mac audio applications support these drivers and should work normally programs that work include final vinyl logic garageband audacity ableton live reason etc how do i use the imic in garageband mac  imic setup to select the imic as an input device go to system preferences and choose sound click on the input tab and select the imic then connect your microphone and speak into it if you do not see the input level move try pushing the switch toward “mic” to enable the internal preamp once you see a level click on the output tab and choose “builtin audio” if you want to hear the audio through your computer speakers if you are going to be listening to headphones or speakers connected to the imic’s output select the imic as the output device instead  audio midi setup open audio midi setup applications  utilities in the system settings default input popup menu select imic usb audio system in the properties for popup menu select imic usb audio system under audio input make sure that format is set to hz chbit  in garageband open garageband and select preferences from the garageband menu click the audiomidi icon in the preferences window select imic usb audio system in the audio input popup menu and close the preferences window select new track from the track menu click the real instrument tab then select basic track  no effects alternately select the type of instrument you want to record as well as whatever effects are available set the format to stereo and set the monitor to on if you want to monitor your audio as you are recording click ok and start recording how do i use a stereo microphone with the imic mac and pc stereo microphones can be confusing because there is such a wide range available from inexpensive camcorders to professional audio models they usually come in two major connection types either two separate connectors or a single stereo plug generally if yours has two connectors xlr or ″ you’ll need to route them through a mixer microphone preamp tape deck etc to properly amplify the signal that signal is then sent to the imic using stereo line out if your microphone has a single stereo plug it may or may not need preamplification be sure to read the microphone manual or contact the manufacturer to determine if your particular model requires preamping if it does treat it as if it had two connections – connect it to a mixer preamp tape deck etc and route it to the imic through the stereo line out if it doesn’t require preamplification simply connect it to the imic ive plugged in my  mic and it doesnt work mac and pc the imic was configured for mic and line level devices such as standard computer microphones and tape decks those devices and there are many types typically are high impedance products that connect via unbalanced cables many if not most professional or higher end microphones are low impedance products that connect via balanced cables those types of devices require preamplification to bring them up to line level this can be accomplished by using the preamps of mixing consoles or by using an impedance matching transformer if you don’t have a mixer the transformers are readily available at electronic supply houses and consumer outlets such as radio shack how do i get the songs ive recorded into itunes burn a cd mac if itunes has not been set up to burn discs as audio discs it might be making a disc of mps instead which will play fine in a dvd player or computer but not in a simple cd player to make sure that itunes is configured to burn audio cds open itunes and then itunes preferences which you can access from the itunes menu in the menu bar or by holding down apple and pressing  comma click on the advanced tab and choose the import tab click click on the burning tab and make sure itunes is set to burn an audio disc to get an audio file that you’ve saved to your desktop into itunes choose import from the file menu and import the track make a new playlist and drag the track from the library to the playlist then select the playlist and click “burn disc” or you could drag your audio file into itunes directly onto the word “library” create a new playlist and drag your recorded songs from the library to your new playlist then click “burn disk” why cant i play the burned disc of my recordings mac if itunes has not been set up to burn discs as audio discs it might be making a disc of mps instead which will play fine in a dvd player or computer but not in a simple cd player open itunes and then itunes preferences which you can access from the itunes menu in the menu bar or by holding down apple and pressing  comma click on the advanced tab then the import tab click on the burning tab and make sure itunes is set to burn an audio disc to get an audio file that you’ve saved to your desktop into itunes choose import from the file menu and import the track make a new playlist and drag the track from the library to the playlist then select the playlist and click “burn disc” or you could drag your audio file into itunes directly onto the word “library” create a new playlist and drag your recorded songs from the library to your new playlist then click “burn disk” i want to use the imic but my cables are too short mac and pc there are various ways to extend your reach when using the imic you can use a highquality usb extension cable to increase the distance between the computer and the imic you can use ″ extension cables between your input device for example a microphone and the imic’s input jack other solutions would be the use of usb hubs acting as repeaters or special types of usb extension cables that have an “amplifier” built in so they can be made much longer than normal usb cables why use imic if i my mac has linein mac you certainly can use your builtin audio but you may get better results with the imic the mac’s builtin audio hardware typically does not perform at professional quality levels introducing noise and distortion the inside of a computer is a very noisy place electrically the power supplies are full of transient noise from the cpu hard drives cd drives and other computer components the builtin mac audio hardware can transfer that noise into the audio io inputoutput the imic stays outside of your noisy computer system attaching via the external usb interface normally this will provide improved performance for audio recording and playback i have a pci usb card in my older mac can i use the imic not as far as we know apple says that usb audio is only supported on machines that have builtin usb ports a usb card installed in older macs may support other usb functions but according to apple it won’t support usb audio what about apple plaintalk mics mac the plaintalk connector is an older proprietary connector used only by apple there have been only a handful of microphone models made that use the plaintalk connection and it appears apple will use usb audio for future offerings therefore we decided to make the imic with the ″ connection accepted as standard for the thousands of other microphone models on the market what are the exact technical specifications on the imic mac and pc  we’re not trying to be flip here well maybe a little bit but there’s a reason in order for us to develop and supply a  audio device it was necessary for that product to be specification independent because it’s not a professional device which would require exact specs for demanding pros but rather a consumer device that fills a very definite need and price for nonprofessionals we have to be able to adjust to changes in the raw materials markets otherwise the extremely low price of the imic could potentially fluctuate and we might have to deal with unnecessary shortages so our engineers made the decision to keep the imic within certain basic parameters and not release a detailed spec sheet the imic will always do  bit ad and da conversion internally and it will record and playback at  bit  khz the quality of the imic has never before been available at anywhere near its price and we’re extremely proud of it having said that we feel if exact specifications are that crucial to your project you might be better served with one of the products costing hundreds of dollars more what drivers do i install for the imic pc there aren’t drivers necessary for the imic if your operating system is usb audio aware xp does this best your mixer will see the imic as an inputoutput device simply go to sounds and audio devices in your control panel and select the imic as your recording device and your computer’s sound card as your playback device what software can i use with the imic pc the imic is fully compatible with xp versions of many audio software programs it appears in the mixer and can be utilized for input and output by all xp compatible programs such as the included sound recorder and windows movie maker or go to the sounds and audio devices icon in control panel and simply choose the imic as your recording device and your computer’s sound card as your playback device then you can use the imic with many software applications such as audacity sound forge cakewalk pro audio steinberg cubase vst emagic logic audio syntrillium cool edit pro and sek’d samplitude studio to name a few is the imic a digital input is it bit khz pc the imic is an ad analog to digital converter and a very good one for the price it will convert your analog input signal to digital and vice versa on output the imic itself does all internal processing at bit resolution but the os currently has a more narrow range of options topping out at bitkhz if you’re using the imic with a standard windows compatible program your optimum recording resolution will be at bitkhz third party usb asio drivers will allow the imic to support up to bit resolution what is the imic is it a microphone pc the imic is not a microphone but rather an inputoutput device using a mm jack that lets you connect standard audio products such as microphones headphones home stereo equipment vcrs musical instruments and virtually any other linelevel or miclevel audio device it’s basically a “sound card on a cable” which allows you to record and play digital audio using your usbequipped pc some windows machines rely on usb for complete audio support others such as some laptops have limited or no audio hardware in these cases the imic can be used for audio input and output i have a pci usb card can i use the imic pc the imic works with pci usb cards the question of compatibility is not between the imic and the card but rather between the imic and the version of windows xp is recommended for windows users im hearing a low hum coming from my turntable this is probably evidence of a grounding issue make sure you have the computer and turntable plugged into different outlets or power strips if there’s a grounding wire hanging off the back of the turntable try attaching this to the grounding screw that is on the back of most amplifiers this can also be wrapped around a metal chair or table leg this should properly ground the turntable and eliminate the hum the recordings sound like chipmunks when played back in itunes check your audiomidi setup open your applications folder from the finder and scroll through the applications down to “utilities” select that and then choose “audiomidi” from here set the “properties for” or “settings for” to imic usb audio system then set both the input and the output to bit  channel hz when launching final vinyl it just bounces in the dock if you are unable to open final vinyl successfully it usually indicates you are missing a java or quicktime update on your computer go to system preferences click on software update and run all the available updates even those that you think you don’t need restart your computer and try to launch final vinyl one more time there seems to be a delay in the sound coming out of the computer currently most if not all usb audio devices seem to suffer a small amount of “latency” a delay from the time audio is input until the time audio is output from the computer this delay is measured in milliseconds and varies slightly depending on the configuration of your mac generally disabling virtual memory and file sharing will shorten the delay significantly but even with reduced latency you may not be able to do realtime monitoring and recording if you don’t require realtime monitoring recording from vcr turntable etc latency is of no concern using imic to record with minimum latency is possible through the use of an external mixer the mixer doesn’t have to be fancy but it will need at least three preferably four outputs brand name mixers such as midiman or samson can be purchased for less than  here’s how to handle latency plug the “main outs” of the mixer into your receiver or powered speakers plug your instrument keyboard guitar microphone etc into the mixer ie “input ” or if stereo “inputs   ” and route the signal to the main output of the mixer you should be able to play and hear your instrument as you do when you’re playing live plug imic’s “audio out” into the mixer you might have to use an adapter on the cable to make this work it’s recommended that you buy a dedicated cable with the right connections as adapters are prone to all sorts of problems assign the inputs that your instrument is on to a “submasters” ie submaster  or  if your mixer doesn’t have a submaster you could use an “auxiliary send” such as the one you would use to send a signal to a reverb or delay unit any way that you can get out of your mixer without using the “main outs” will work whatever output you choose connect it using the appropriate cable to imic’s input in the sound control panel set the input to “imic usb audio” make sure you turn off the sound playthrough or passthrough in your audio recording software that way you won’t hear your input as it comes out of the computer you don’t want to hear the sound from that source because it will be delayed and you’ll be out of sync with your prerecorded material instead because you have assigned your instrument to play directly out of the mixer you are playing in real time with the prerecorded material all tracks will be in sync on playback i cant get my imic to work with skype mac and pc mac if you are using a headset mic then you first need to connect the mic and speaker cable into the in and out ports on the imic toggle the imic to mic go to your system preferencessound preferences on both the input and output tabs select imic from the list of devices open your skype preferences and choose audio select the imic as both the audio input and output the same applies if you are only using a computer desk mic with no headset the difference is that you choose the built in audio for the system preferencessound and skype output pc if you are using a

can i use the imic with a cisco server this is not a supported use of the imic and has not been tested by griffin however the griffin imic usb sound card continues to be supported by cisco for use as an moh live feed source with cisco callmanager release  and later and with microsoft windows  os  version  or later cisco supports the imic on all cisco mcsxxh or mcsxxi servers with  ghz or greater processor for help on using the imic in these environments please contact the cisco technical assistance center tac or cisco customers can contact the tac at one of the following numbers usa

restart your computer finally download a fresh copy of final vinyl from our website and reinstall   can you explain in plain english how to record lps onto my pc first connect your device let’s say it’s a turntable to imic’s input then flip imic’s switch to the “line” position if you’re using a lineout of your receiver that would be the red and white rca type connectors or to the “mic” position if you’re connecting the wires directly from the turntable “mic” mode engages imic’s internal preamp which you’ll probably need to boost the signal of the turntable plug imic into a usb port on your computer in your control panel go to soundsaudio devices make your soundcard your playback device and imic your recording device next you’ll need some recording software for pc users we recommend a program called audacity which you can download here once you’ve downloaded and installed audacity open the program and go to preferences which you’ll find under edit in the menu bar or you can just hold down the control key and press p click on the audio io tab and make your soundcard your playback device and imic your recording device choose  channel stereo and be sure to check the box that says “software playthrough” close preferences now you’re ready if you click pause and then click record you should be able to now hear audio come through your computer speakers and you can cue up your tape record etc the controls in audacity are pretty simple red circle is record brown box is stop etc just be sure that when you save a file you actually choose “export” under file and export it as a wav audacity will ask you to name the file and say where you want it to be saved we recommend that you save it to the desktop so that you can just drag it to itunes if you want to burn a disc my imic will not work in vista the imic hardware is not compatible with the microsoft vista operating system   does the imic work in mac os  yes it works with our latest version of final vinyl version  which you can download here the imic is also compatible with many other recording programs such as garageband and audacity when choosing my device in final vinyl i dont see the imic final vinyl  if you do not see the imic as a device option in final vinyl’s preferences just quit final vinyl and reopen it when making a recording with the imic in final vinyl  the imic needs to be selected as the recording device in the final vinyl preferences if you do not plug the imic in before opening final vinyl it will not appear under preferences you can see a full demonstration on how to setup the imic here when should i use eq and other filters in final vinyl in final vinyl eq and other filters should only be used after the recording is finished if you try to use those filters before or during a recording they will have no effect i can no longer cut copy or paste in final vinyl  unfortunately final vinyl  was broken by an update to a key component of the software if you are runing mac os  or later we recommend updating to final vinyl  available from the imic support page if you’re running mac os  then we recommend that you check out audacity a fantastic open source recording program that we’ve recommended for our pc users for years can i use final vinyl in lion mac os  final vinyl is not currently supported for use in lion apple’s au audio effects do not appear to be working properly when final vinyl is run in os  other than those specific effects though the other basic functions of finyl vinal work just fine in lion these include recording editing and exporting audio files final vinyl’s own effects and filters such as eq volume and normalize also work ive downloaded final vinyl but mountain lion says it cant be opened mountain lion includes a security feature called gatekeeper which prevents certain applications downloaded from the internet from being installed or opened to bypass gatekeeper so that you can use final vinyl find final vinyl in your applications folder then hold the control key and click on the final vinyl icon select “open” from the menu that appears you’ll get a message from mountain lion asking you to verify that you want to open final vinyl choose “open” you may have to enter your password at this point final vinyl will now open normally you’ll only have to complete this process once this will add final vinyl to gatekeeper’s
