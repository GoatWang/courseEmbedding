economy us economy the fed central banks jobs gdp outlook economist zandi who predicted a lengthy recession under trump now says thats unlikely mark zandi of moodys analytics said in june  that trumps policies would tank growth and cause a surge in unemployment current conditions show an economy neither overheating nor displaying signs of financial weakness he now says trumps detractors a camp in which zandi was last year are overly pessimistic he said jeff cox  jeffcoxcnbccom tuesday  apr    pm etcnbccom shares show chapters moodys zandi jobs market feels good to me    friday  apr    pm et   economist mark zandi has a new take about the state of the economy under donald trump believing that both the presidents supporters and opponents have it wrong during the presidential campaign zandi chief economist at moodys analytics warned that a trump presidency would cause a lengthy recession in addition to the recession zandi and his team figured that the republicans policies would result in  million fewer jobs and an unemployment rate that would zoom to  percent that opinion however was based on the premise that all of trumps proposals on the campaign trail would come to fruition — something that hasnt happened in a new analysis issued tuesday zandis evaluation is hardly a robust assessment of potential growth but the prognosis for the economy doesnt match up to the dire electionseason scenario the reality regarding the economys performance is not nearly as good as trump supporters believe nor as bad as claimed by trump detractors he wrote nothing much has changed for the economy since the election it is expanding at the same pace as it has throughout its nearlyeightyear expansion — real gdp growth of  percent and job growth of about  per month indeed there is plenty of evidence both to support and rebut each sides respective position on the protrump side the stock market has been hovering around record highs confidence is strong across the board and job creation got off to a quick start in january and february his detractors can point to a weak march jobs number hard data that doesnt match up to the high confidence levels and continued weakness in consumer spending many economists though continue to believe that growth will accelerate in fact fitch ratings one of the main competitors for moodys itself said last week that projections it made just a month or so ago for the us economy under trump were too dire in an interview zandi said gridlock is actually benefiting the economys prospects at least compared to what things looked like during the campaign there are a lot of places where this could go off the rails he said mentioning a hard line on immigration or a currency war specifically at the moment it feels like its less of a threat than it was back in the campaign getty images presidentelect donald trump speaks to supporters during a rally at the giant center december   in hershey pennsylvania to be sure the firstquarter growth numbers are not good the atlanta fed estimates that gdp grew just  percent during the period however zandi said first quarters historically have been slow during the recovery so the trump detractors shouldnt read too much into how the year starts trump detractors who believe the new president will quickly drive the economy into a ditch are overly pessimistic he said sustained economic growth is possible but will require that trump supporters and detractors find a way to work together zandi thinks the sentiment surveys also are overstating things enthusiasm over trumps progrowth agenda of lower taxes less regulation and more domestic infrastructure spending could wane now that political realities are getting in the way getting much more growth out of a jobs market that is near full employment also will be tough zandi argued however he doesnt see signs of the recession he forecast in june two conditions would have to be present to make that happen an overheating economy that would cause the fed to raise interest rates faster than anticipated and a significant fault line somewhere in the financial system such as a potential asset bubble in the housing market or in stocks and bonds there are budding imbalances today of which we should be watchful but none appear close to being an existential threat to the current expansion he said zandi projects that economic progress can happen so long as the two warring factions in washington can work together and trump doesnt follow through on his antiimmigration and protectionist rhetoric jeff coxfinance editor to view
