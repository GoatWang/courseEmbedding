companies however applicants request an exemption under section c and e of the act from all provisions of the act except sections  through  of the act and the rules and regulations under those sections  section aa of the act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities applicants believe that the fund will not be an investment company under section aa because the fund will be in the business of investing in and being beneficial owner of apartment complexes not securities  section ac of the act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding  of the value of such issuers total assets exclusive of government securities

consequences and have no value apart from the value of the apartment complexes owned by the local limited partnerships  applicants believe that the twotier structure is consistent with the purposes and criteria set forth in the commissions release concerning twotier real estate partnerships the start printed page “release” the release states that investment companies that are twotier real estate partnerships that invest in limited partnerships engaged in the development and operation of housing for low and moderate income persons may qualify for an exemption from the act pursuant to section c section c provides that the commission may exempt any person from any provision of the act and any rule thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section e permits the commission to require companies exempted from the registration requirements of the act to comply with certain specified provisions of the act as though the company were a registered investment company  the release lists two conditions designed for the protection of investors which must be satisfied by twotier partnerships to qualify for the exemption under section c first interests in the issuer should be sold only to persons for whom investments in limited profit essentially taxshelter investments would not be unsuitable second requirements for fair dealing by the general partner of the issuer with the limited partners of the issuer should be included in the basic organizational documents of the company  applicants assert among other things that the suitability standards set forth in the application the requirements for fair dealing provided by the partnership agreement and pertinent governmental regulations imposed on each local limited partnership by various federal state and local agencies provide protection to investors in units in addition applicants assert that the requested exemption is both necessary and appropriate in the public interest start signature for the commission by the division of investment

interim financial information and with the instructions to form q for quarterly reports under section  or d of the securities exchange act of   accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for complete financial statements  in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included  operating results for the nine months ended december   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending march    for further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the partnerships annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march     organization   wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series  the partnership is a california limited partnership formed on june   under the laws of the state of california and commenced operations on september    the partnership was formed to acquire limited partnership interests in other limited partnerships “local limited partnerships” which own multifamily housing complexes “housing complexes” that are eligible for federal low income housing tax credits “low income housing tax credits”  the local general partners the “local general partners” of each local limited partnership retain responsibility for maintaining operating and managing the housing complexes each local limited partnership is governed by its agreement of limited partnership the “local limited partnership agreement”   the general partner of the partnership is wnc  associates inc a california corporation “associates” or the “general partner” the chairman and president of associates owns all of the outstanding stock of associates  the business of the partnership is conducted primarily through associates as the partnership has no employees of its own   the partnership shall continue in full force and effect until december   unless terminated prior to that date pursuant to the partnership agreement or law   the financial statements include only activity relating to the business of the partnership and do not give effect to any assets that the partners may have outside of their interests in the partnership or to any obligations including income taxes of the partners   the partnership agreement authorized the sale of up to  units of limited partnership interest “partnership units” at  per partnership unit the offering of partnership units has concluded and  partnership units representing subscriptions in the amount of  net of dealer discounts of  had been accepted  the general partner has a  interest in operating profits and losses taxable income and losses cash available for distribution from the partnership and low income housing tax credits of the partnership the investors the “limited partners” will be allocated the remaining  of these items in proportion to their respective investments   the proceeds from the disposition of any of the local limited partnership housing complexes will be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective local limited partnership agreement  any remaining proceeds will then be paid to the partnership  the sale of a housing complex may be subject to other restrictions and obligations  accordingly there can be no assurance that a local limited partnership will be able to sell its housing complex  even if it does so there can be no assurance that any     significant        amounts    of        cash      will    be    distributed      to   the   partnership       should     such       distributions   occur      the     limited     partners       will     be     entitled    to     receive      distributions    equal   to  their  capital   contributions  and          wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series  a california limited partnership   notes to condensed financial statements  continued   for the nine months ended december   and    note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   their return on investment as defined in the partnership agreement and the general partner would then be entitled to receive proceeds  equal to its capital contributions from the remainder  any additional sale or refinancing proceeds will be distributed  to the limited partners in proportion to their respective investments and  to the general partner   risks and uncertainties   an investment in the partnership and the partnership’s investments in local limited partnerships and their housing complexes are subject to risks  these risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the partnership and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to the limited partners if any on liquidation of the partnership’s investments  some of those risks include the following   the low income housing tax credits rules are extremely complicated noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future low income housing tax credits and the fractional recapture of low income housing tax credits already taken in most cases the annual amount of low income housing tax credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person’s last  of taxable income the local limited partnerships may be unable to sell the housing complexes at a price which would result in the partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction  accordingly the partnership may be unable to distribute any cash to its limited partners low income housing tax credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the partnership   the partnership has invested in a limited number of local limited partnerships such limited diversity means that the results of operation of each single housing complex will have a greater impact on the partnership with limited diversity poor performance of one housing complex could impair the partnership’s ability to satisfy its investment objectives  each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness if a local limited partnership failed to pay its mortgage it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure if foreclosure were to occur during the first  years the loss of any remaining future low income housing tax credits a fractional recapture of prior low income housing tax credits and a loss of the partnership’s investment in the housing complex would occur the partnership is a limited partner or a nonmanaging member of each local limited partnership accordingly the partnership will have very limited rights with respect to management of the local limited partnerships the partnership will rely totally on the local general partners neither the partnership’s investments in local limited partnerships nor the local limited partnerships’ investments in housing complexes are readily marketable to the extent the housing complexes receive government financing or operating subsidies they may be subject to one or more of the following risks difficulties in obtaining tenants for the housing complexes difficulties in obtaining rent increases limitations on cash distributions limitations on sales or refinancing of housing complexes limitations on transfers of interests in local limited partnerships limitations on removal of local general partners limitations on subsidy programs and possible changes in applicable regulations  uninsured casualties could result in loss of property and low income housing tax credits and recapture of low income housing tax credits previously taken the value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions including employment rates inflation tax environmental land use and zoning policies supply and demand of similar housing complexes and neighborhood conditions among others   the ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from the partnership is limited the irs may audit the partnership or a local limited partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items the amount of low income housing tax credits and tax losses allocable to limited partners could be reduced if the irs were successful in such a challenge  the alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in the partnership  changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the partnership andor the value of the housing complexes          wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series  a california limited partnership   notes to condensed financial statements  continued   for the nine months ended december   and    note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   no trading market for the partnership units exists or is expected to develop limited partners may be unable to sell their partnership units except at a discount and should consider their partnership units to be a longterm investment individual limited partners will have no recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a vote of the majority of  limited partners   exit strategy   the compliance period for a housing complex is generally  years following construction or rehabilitation completion associates was one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated investments in low income housing tax credits  the initial programs are completing their compliance periods   upon the sale of a local limited partnership or housing complex after the end of the compliance period there would be no recapture of low income housing tax credits a sale prior to the end of the compliance period could result in recapture if certain conditions are not met  none of the local limited partnership have completed their year compliance period   with that in mind the general partner is continuing its review of the housing complexes with special emphasis on the more mature housing complexes such as any that have satisfied the irs compliance requirements  the review considers many factors including extended use requirements such as those due to mortgage restrictions or state compliance agreements the condition of the local limited partnerships and the tax consequences to the limited partners from the sale of the housing complexes   upon identifying those housing complexes with the highest potential for a successful sale refinancing or syndication the partnership expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate them the objective is to maximize the limited partners’ return wherever possible and ultimately to wind down the partnership local limited partnership interests may be disposed of any time by the general partner in its discretion while liquidation of the housing complexes continues to be evaluated the dissolution of the partnership was not imminent as of december   as of december   no local limited partnerships have been sold and one local limited partnership lake village apartments lp has been identified for disposition   method of accounting for investments in local limited partnerships   the partnership accounts for its investments in local limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting whereby the partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the local limited partnerships’ results of operations and for any contributions made and distributions received the partnership reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a local limited partnership for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may not be recoverable  recoverability of such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by management generally consisting of the sum of the remaining future low income housing tax credits estimated to be allocable to the partnership and the estimated residual value to the partnership   if an investment is considered to be impaired the partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any such local limited partnership  the accounting policies of the local limited partnerships generally are expected to be consistent with those of the partnership costs incurred by the partnership in acquiring the investments are capitalized as part of the investment account and are being amortized over  years see note           wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series  a california limited partnership   notes to condensed financial statements  continued   for the nine months ended december   and    note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   “equity in losses of local limited partnerships” for the periods ended december   and  have been recorded by the partnership management’s estimate for the three and ninemonth period is based on either actual unaudited results reported by the local limited partnerships or historical trends in the operations of the local limited partnerships in subsequent annual financial statements upon receiving the actual annual results reported by the local limited partnerships management reverses its prior estimate and records the actual results reported by the local limited partnerships  equity in losses of local limited partnerships allocated to the partnership are not recognized to   the extent that the investment balance would be adjusted below zero  if the local limited partnerships reported net income in future years the partnership will resume applying the equity method only after its share of such net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the periods the equity method was suspended see note    in accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities the partnership determines when it should include the assets liabilities and activities of a variable interest entity vie in its financial statements and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a vie a vie is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets and a vie must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because a primary beneficiary absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses the majority of the expected residual returns or both the local limited partnerships in which the partnership invests are vies however management does not consolidate the partnership’s interests in these vie’s as the partnership is not considered the primary beneficiary the partnership’s balance in its investment in local limited partnerships plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments represents its maximum exposure to loss the partnership may be subject to additional losses to the extent of any financial support that the partnership voluntarily provides to the local limited partnerships in the future   distributions received by the partnership are accounted for as a reduction of the investment balance  distributions received after the investment has reached zero are recognized as income  as of december   one of the investment balances had reached zero   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could materially differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   the partnership considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents  as of december   and march   the partnership had no cash equivalents   reporting comprehensive income   the partnership had no items of other comprehensive income for all periods presented   concentration of credit risk   as of december   and march   the partnership maintained cash balances at certain financial institutions in excess of the federally insured maximum  the partnership believes it is not exposed to any significant financial risk on cash          wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series  a california limited partnership   notes to condensed financial statements  continued   for the nine months ended december   and      note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   income taxes   the partnership has elected to be treated as a passthrough entity for income tax purposes and as such is not subject to income taxes rather all items of taxable income deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns the partnership’s federal tax status as a passthrough entity is based on its legal status as a partnership accordingly the partnership is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a passthrough entity the partnership is required to file and does file tax returns with the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities accordingly these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the partnership has no other tax positions which must be considered for disclosure   net loss per partnership unit   net loss per partnership unit includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss allocated to limited partners by the weighted average number of partnership units outstanding during the period  calculation of diluted net loss per partnership unit is not required   revenue recognition   the partnership is entitled to receive reporting fees from the local limited partnerships  the intent of the reporting fees is to offset in part administrative costs incurred by the partnership in corresponding with the local limited partnerships  due to the uncertainty of the collection of these fees the partnership recognizes reporting fees as collections are made   amortization   acquisition fees and costs are being amortized over  years using the straightline method amortization expense for each of the nine months ended december   and  was    impairment   the partnership reviews its investments in local limited partnerships for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such investments may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total amount of the remaining low income housing tax credits allocated to the partnership and any estimated residual value of the investment for the nine months ended december   and  impairment loss related to investments in local limited partnerships was  and  respectively   the partnership also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in local limited partnerships impairment on the intangibles is measured by comparing the partnership’s total investment balance after impairment of investments in local limited partnerships to the sum of the total of the remaining low income housing tax credits allocated to the partnership and the estimated residual value of the investment during each of the nine months ended december   and  no impairment loss was recorded on the related intangibles            wnc
