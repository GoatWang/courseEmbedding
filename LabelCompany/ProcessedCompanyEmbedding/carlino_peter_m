its good to be in charge at greater berks countys top companies especially on payday executives leading berksarea publicly traded companies brought home a median of  million in  in a time when wages have fallen in pennsylvania locally the toppaid executive was peter m carlino the chairman and chief executive officer of penn national gaming inc wyomissing with a total of  million in pay stock and benefits in  according to a review of financial documents of locally publicly traded companies the firms are required to disclose compensation of the principal executive officer and financial officer plus the top three highestpaid executives coming in a close second is the hershey co president and ceo john bilbrey with compensation of  million trexlertownbased air products and chemicals inc president and ceo j e mcglade was third with  million more than threequarters of top executives at  berksarea publicly traded companies received a raise in  nearly  percent had their pay cut and  percent werent listed in company filing documents last year the paychecks are high but thats the premium companies will pay to find the right executive said aaron boyd director of governance research with equilar a california company that tracks executive compensation companies are getting bigger and bigger and more dollars are at stake he said bringing in the right executive can increase revenue or sales by a billion dollars so companies are willing to pay top dollar executive pay has become a hot topic with the occupy wall street movement the recession and the push to make corporate practices transparent which resulted in the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act passed in  after several years of lower pay most local companies are paying executives prerecession paychecks said chet mosteller president of mosteller and associates a human resources consulting firm in cumru township things are starting to bounce back to what were calling normalcy he said berks county companies in general offer fairly conservative compensation for executives mosteller said top management pay reflects the regions value of rewarding hard work also for smaller companies the boards of directors are typically local businesspeople and are aware of shareholders who live in the same community the firm works with companies throughout the midatlantic to create peer compensation studies mosteller said executives at the areas top companies are paid base salaries plus annual cash incentives based on performance and longterm incentive awards in stock and options there are also benefits such as health and life insurance and retirement funds and perks such as car allowances spousal travel to business events and bonuses for overseas assignments the compensation packages differ from company to company but generally more than half of an executives pay is based on performance compensation is set by board committees and usually based on pay among companies in the same industry or similar size additional performance targets are based on things such as revenue and shareholder return shareholders have a say as well say on pay votes became a requirement for public companies in  and more companies are trying to do a better job to communicate with shareholders about pay boyd said for example penn national spoke directly with its top  shareholders about pay and held quarterly conference calls about the issue youre seeing companies having these conversations and shareholders are explaining what they dont like boyd said last year stockholders approved executive pay at all of the top  local companies most with an overwhelming majority the companies use compensation to attract top managers as well as grow business and shareholder returns incentives are based on goals such as operating margins safety records and individual performance if the thresholds arent met theres no bonus performance pay is often tied to stock including stock that cant be traded for several years that helps retain management minimize risk and connect compensation to the companys financials while in the past local boards may have been more lackadaisical about the metrics more boards are getting better at establishing formulas goals and strategies to set executive compensation mosteller said in addition several of the companies including hershey and teleflex inc limerick require the top executives to own up to five times their salaries in company stock nationally pay is starting to flatten out said equilars boyd but theres a balancing act tween cash bonuses and stock awards cash bonuses have dropped from high levels of  as companies set more aggressive goals at the same time the stock market has improved increasing the value of stock awards in  most executives in the top  list brought home more money at hershey they earned abovetarget incentive awards after total shareholder return hit  percent triple the sp  index susquehanna bancshares inc lititz acquired tower bancorp harrisburg and saw revenues and returns increase nearly  percent top executive salaries grew to fit the new category and they also received  to  more in retirement plans boards also gave special awards at teleflex president and ceo benson f smith received an extra  million in stock to recognize his performance and the significant increase in shareholder value under his tenure at carpenter technology corp andrew t ziolkowski senior vice president of latrobe operations received a special performancebased restricted stock award worth  for his role in the acquiring and integrating latrobe specialty metals inc however because air products and chemicals didnt meet growth targets executive incentive payments were significantly lower than in previous years even terminated executives got a golden parachute richard a meier former executive vice president and chief financial officer for teleflex was terminated in march and received  including  for a car lease and  in executive outplacement services but resignations arent as lucrative wyomissingbased customers bancorp inc chief financial officer thomas r brugger resigned to take the same role at new jesreybased sun national bank with his resignation he didnt get any additional payments and he forfeited his outstanding equity awards also of note just three of the top  executives are women michele buck and leslie turner from the hershey co and sandra l bodnyk at national penn bancshares inc as more baby boomer executives retire mosteller expects to see upper management pay increase traditionally middle managers were trained in a broad range of areas and groomed to become top executives training programs have been drastically cut leaving a smaller pool of qualified candidates as boomers retire another five to  years from now it might be  percent fewer available executives in the marketplace mosteller said contact erin negley  or enegleyreadingeaglecom purchase daily photos
