pickup truck with range extender for fleets news provided by workhorse group inc nov    et share this article cincinnati nov   prnewswire  workhorse group inc nasdaq wkhs an original equipment manufacturer oem of batteryelectric vehicles today announced that it has commenced development of an electric pickup work truck with range extender for fleet usage concept of workhorse w electric pickup truck with extended range expected to be in production  the new workhorse w light duty platform design is an extension of the egen electric technology used in workhorse mediumduty delivery trucks  with an expected  mile battery range using panasonic  liion batteries the workhorse w light duty design expects to provide economical clean and powerful performance  the expected mile range from the battery pack of the workhorse pickup truck is expected to cover the vast majority of miles driven in a day by fleet owners of locally driven trucks if needed the gasoline generator will then operate after battery power has been depleted allowing the driver unlimited range to complete the days tasks as many fleet operators are committed to the greening of their fleet the workhorse w electric truck will be designed to dramatically lower emissions  lower fueling and maintenance costs are expected to deliver lower total cost of ownership tco for fleet managers workhorse has already received nonbinding letters of interest from duke energy as well as the city of orlando municipal fleet for a number of years duke energy along with other electric utilities in the country has been asking manufacturers to build plugin electric vehicles that could replace the highest volume vehicle types within our fleet  the workhorse truck does exactly that in a manner that is expected  to reduce fuel consumption as well as significantly lowering fleet emissions  including proven components such as the rangeextending generator package in the design is expected to ease many of the concerns companies have when introducing new and innovative products into their fleets millions of pickup trucks are sold in the united states each year and pickup trucks are a leading vehicle platform of choice for fleets  the electric powered w represents an opportunity to bring tremendous fuel savings and emissions reduction to the streets of america without sacrificing functionality  additionally the w s goal is to be the safest pickup truck on the market with its large frontal crumble zone and low center of gravity we believe this will be the first plugin rangeextended electric pickup truck built from the ground up by an oem in america its not a conversion vehicle said steve burns workhorse ceo we feel the extended range capability from the combination of panasonic batteries
