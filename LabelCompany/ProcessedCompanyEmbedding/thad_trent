included in the earnings press release issued today ill now turn the call over to hassane hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp thank you colin and thank you all for joining us some of you may know colin born from his time at atheros and qualcomm or more recently gopro he recently joined us as vp of corporate development and investor relations and were glad to have him here from where im sitting he seems pretty excited to be here too and for good reason its a very exciting time for cypress its now been a year since we embarked on our cypress  strategy of for focusing the company on selling innovative and differentiated embedded solutions into markets that are growing faster than the overall semiconductor industry the cypress team has been executing well to this strategy and we are beginning to see the benefits in the form of solid revenue margin and earnings growth in short cypress  is resonating well with both customers and partners establishing cypress as a premier provider of solutions for the rapidly growing world of connected things our q results reflect another record revenue quarter that exceeded our expectations driven by strength across many markets and products including automotive wired and wireless connectivity as well as favorable flash memory market dynamics as you know we exited the commodity memory business and have been capitalizing on strong demand at the higher end of the market the nand and nor flash markets continue to be supply constrained allowing us to focus on revenue growth to drive incremental and sustainable earnings while maintaining our gross margin trajectory as we have discussed in the past cypress is focused on driving growth across three key vectors wireless connectivity usbc and automotive and ill now discuss our progress in each of these focus areas first wireless connectivity which we report as our iot business unit let me start by saying we are the market leader in wireless connectivity solutions for the iot market with the broadest customer footprint and product portfolio and the results to show it its now been just over a year since we acquired the wireless iot technology team and business from broadcom we have been very pleased with the teams strong execution and the financial results over this past year cypress strategic plan behind this acquisition is proving to be very powerful as the team tailors the acquired connectivity technology roadmap towards iot at a platformwide level integrating our wireless connectivity with our microcontroller psoc usbc and memory hardware and software portfolio and then driving this complete product portfolio through cypress wellestablished automotive industrial and consumer channels cypress now has the most compelling and broad semiconductor and software product offering for the rapidly growing iot industry and that is very exciting however continued execution is critical and that is why we are pleased that the integrated team recently achieved the significant milestone of sampling and introducing our first new combo chip as part of cypress this is our first part that has completed its development cycle since the acquisition and there are more to come that will be in production by yearend with leading customers we continue to see broad applicability for our bestinclass wireless connectivity technology and solutions and have had good success in driving demand across a broad set of customers we have doubled our customer count and increased our community users by over  since the acquisition we are driving broader adoption of cypress iot wireless connectivity solutions with the recent introduction of our quicksilver development platform in collaboration with arrow electronics to leverage our wiced studio sdk and wifi microcontroller targeting designs in both the industrial and consumer endmarkets we also updated wiced with enhanced apple homekit support for smart home applications making it easier for our customers to design in solutions and leverage the expanding apple ecosystem including icloud support for streamlined cloud connectivity as a further proof of accelerating design activity cypress wireless connectivity wiced sdk downloads were up by over  in the second quarter compared to the first quarter with another quarter of doubledigit sequential revenue growth the iot wireless connectivity business has exceeded our expectations over the last year just today our customer netgear announced that their arlo ip camera business more than doubled yearoveryear in the second quarter as cypress drives strong adoption of ac and bluetooth into emerging iot platforms the business is well positioned for growth in the second half from a broad set of customers including nintendo while we do expect q to be a peak quarter for wireless connectivity due to holiday build were increasing our annual iot wireless connectivity growth target to between  and  from our pervious target of  to  just to be clear this is only our wireless connectivity incremental to all other revenue from solutions we ship into the same iot end products and customers next usbc the market is beginning to ramp as we expected customers are rapidly adopting usbc to take advantage of the simplicity of a single slim easytouse connector for power data and video while also benefiting from faster charging highspeed data transfer and port consolidation the ecosystem is rapidly developing and cypress is driving this proliferation and fan out into pcs tablets mobile devices cables docks and other accessories beyond these more traditional markets cypress is also leading the charge in driving usbc adoption at automotive and industrial customers the number of customers in production with cypress usbc have grown by over  since last year as we started to see buying in q we recently introduced our newest controller which includes support for intels thunderbolt connectivity to increase the ramp of usbc into notebooks and desktop pcs as well as docking stations additionally a recent teardown of the ipad pro  inch identified our ccg usbc controller for power delivery which cuts charging time by  using usbc to lightning further showcasing the flexibility of usbcs benefit even in existing ecosystems we are starting to see strong customer traction for usbc in automotive and have begun qualifying our usbc solutions for top automotive oems usbc provides faster and higher wattage charging of mobile devices in cars including smartphones tablets notebook pcs game consoles and other electronic – personal electronics these examples illustrate how we are expanding our reach and taking advantage of market adjacencies in usbc with our solutions integration and programmability as a reminder usbc is just starting to take off and is expected to be a multiyear transition we are encouraged by the activity so far and looking ahead to the second half of  and beyond finally in automotive where cypress is the leading provider of embedded solutions we continue to drive content growth in the car of tomorrow in q our automotive revenue grew  to another record for cypress and we are positioned to win as the market leader in instrument clusters connected car adas and infotainment which are all growing faster than the overall automotive market as an example our leading traveo mcu and nor flash memory are enabling a sophisticated graphic solution for denso instrument clusters in the  toyota camry we are at the forefront of the expanding market for autonomous driving solutions with our nor flash as evidenced by our recently expanded collaboration with bosch to provide critical functions to the adas platform finally we are now designed into all of the top eight worldwide automotive oems for wifi and bluetooth connectivity in the car we are pleased to report our most recent win the new audi a the a was recently launched on july  at the audi summit held in barcelona and will appear on the german market in the late fall  cypress is enabling ac connectivity for content sharing hotspot and rearseat entertainment this is the first european car model that offers this capability and is another example of the integrated cypress team completing the production cycle for an iot product in the first year since the acquisition in closing i want to again acknowledge that these results would not have been possible without the strong execution by our worldwide team despite thad and i spending a significant amount of our time on the proxy contest during the second quarter we exceeded our revenue and earnings guidance and give credit to the strength of our team id like to thank our employees customers and partners for their continued commitment and support now ill turn it over thad to talk about our numbers thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp thanks hassane im pleased to report another strong quarter that further underscores our execution of cypress  and our results are reflecting the operating leverage in our model today were reporting another quarter of record revenue in the postsunpower era and the highest eps since q of  q revenue of  million increased  sequentially while we delivered  of eps an increase of  sequentially and  times faster than the revenue growth ill walk you through each of the drivers as we step through the details for the quarter first let me give some color on the demand environment we believe the overall market remains healthy as we saw sequentially growth in all regions and all end market segments driven by content gains in connectivity microcontrollers and memory our automotive business continues to be robust achieving another record revenue levels growing  sequentially and  over q of  the consumer segment of our business also set a record revenue level growing  sequentially driven by strength across iot wireless connectivity microcontrollers and flash memory and as a point of reference auto and industrial segments represents  of total revenue and consumer is  of our revenue during the quarter we saw incremental demand due to limited supply in the flash memory market allowing us to opportunistically engage with customers demand for our broadbased microcontroller and psoc products also exceeded our expectations with ramping of new end customer products in the consumer and communication segments and now turning over to the divisions mcd revenue was  million up  from q as we continue to see strength in our wireless connectivity business as well as microcontrollers as i noted last quarter were building inventory and adding capacity to support end customer demand in these areas and we saw customers replenishing their inventory levels in the quarter revenue in our iot wireless connectivity business increased  over q and nonauto microcontrollers increased  were also beginning to see the ramp of usbc as numerous design wins are starting to go into production we expect more than  pc models to be in production by yearend along with ramping mobile devices power adapters and other accessories mpd revenue was  million up  from q and as i mentioned better than we expected due to strength in flash memory which sequentially increased  on a dollar basis and  on a unit basis as we brought on additional supply to meet this demand we have seen a favorable pricing environment but keep in mind over half of our flash memory business is based on longterm contracts for our embedded customers we are well positioned in the nor market and will continue to drive incremental earnings and cash flow in this environment that brings me to gross margin our q gross margin came in at  the high end of our guidance as we continue to execute on our margin improvement plan the  is a  basis point improvement over q of  ramps in both wired and iot wireless connectivity where margins are at or above corporate average were offset by strength in legacy fujitsu mcu automotive and certain flash products where margins are below the corporate average fab utilization was  and is expected to increase to approximately  by the end of the year we expect q margins to again improve to  plus or minus and we remain on track to achieve the  gross margin target for q let me give you a few numbers for your models our operating expenses for q were  million or  of revenue this included  million of proxyrelated expenses and there is an additional  million of settlement expenses accounted for our gaaponly results our oie was  million which reflects reduced interest expense from term loan refinancing and favorable foreign exchange impact our tax expense in q was  million our diluted share count for q was  million shares this includes  million shares for the inthemoney portion of the spansion convertible which increased by approximately  shares in q due to our higher stock price this resulted in net income of  million or  per share above our guidance range so turning to the balance sheet cash and shortterm investments totaled  million and we had  million undrawn on our revolver cash from operations was  million accounts receivable at the end of second quarter was  million resulting in dso of  days inventory decreased  million sequentially to  million with decreases in both mpd and mcd as we met increased demand in q our days of inventory decreased to  days as we focused on inventory our q nongaap ebitda was  million another record level since the spansion merger and our debt was  billion our debttoebitda leverage is  times and we remain focused on driving this below  times by the end of the year our capex was  million depreciation of  million for the quarter so turning to guidance for the third quarter again we entered the quarter over  booked as our broad customer base and auto customers were providing better visibility the booktobill was  lead times extended within the quarter on our flash products requiring customers to layer in additional bookings adjusted for this lead time extension our normalized booktobill is  a quarter ago we had expected slightly betterthannormal seasonal patterns for the second half of the year based on our first half results the current market dynamics and ramping of our new products our business is performing betterthannormal seasonal patterns were expecting q revenue of  million to  million which at the midpoint is up  on the aboveseasonal q revenue and significantly above our expectations  days ago also at the midpoint our q revenue will increase  over q of  this guidance also reflects the usbc ramp weve been expecting in the second half and well continue to be selective in the memory market focusing on earnings growth over market share gains our q gross margins as i stated is expected to be  plus or minus and as always margin will vary with utilization products and customer mix we expect q operating expenses between  million and  million for the quarter our net oie will be approximately  million tax expenses will be approximately  million capex is estimated to be  million and depreciation of approximately  million we anticipate the fully diluted share count to be  million shares and as a result earnings per share is expected to be in the range of  to  for the quarter so to wrap things up q was further evidence of our teams strong execution of our cypress  strategy our results and guidance once again demonstrates the leverage in our operating model as we deliver earnings at a faster pace than revenue growth with that ill now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the qa questionandanswer session operator thank you sir we will now begin the questionandanswer session our first question is coming from the line of blayne curtis of barclays your line is open you may begin blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for taking my question and nice results thad or hassane maybe you can just talk about as you look into september youre seeing a little bit of growth obviously off of a high june between the two segments maybe you can just talk about if you expect one to be up and the other down i couldnt figure out on the memory side the bookings in flash but then you said youre walking away from  some so maybe you can just talk about the moving pieces within those two segments and in which directions theyre going into september thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp yeah blayne this is thad so we expect slight growth in the mcd division driven by obviously the iot wireless connectivity the microcontrollers for automotive the memory side right now were projecting to be essentially kind of flat for the quarter well see how that plays out with the current market dynamics but right now as we brought on the capacity were at full capacity to support that business and depending on the mix wont necessarily have the ability to grow that revenue within the quarter much more than what we saw in q so the slight revenue growth we expect to be coming from mcd blayne curtis  barclays capital inc got you and then i just wanted to ask on usbc i think you said in the press release record revenue but obviously small base can you just talk about the trajectory in the second half whats the right quarter that youll see a contribution there as you look at september and december and if you can frame the magnitude of the opportunity there hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp this is hassane blayne so the second half of the year as weve forecasted before is going to be on the ramp we started seeing the pull from the customers in q in preparation for the ramp for the second half so all of that is kind of coming in exactly where we had expected it to be at the beginning of the year and in analyst day its going to come from ramping mobile and pc were in a lot of pc models that are starting as well as mobile ramps that will be in the second half of the year all that is already in our guide but its following according to plan according to our original forecast blayne curtis  barclays capital inc perfect great job guys thanks thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp thanks operator thank you sir for our next question on queue this will come from the line of john pitzer of credit suisse your line is open you may begin john w pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc yeah good afternoon guys thanks for letting me ask the questions congratulation on the strong results hassane maybe just a followup to blaynes question on the usb typec im wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive moats you have there how durable are these sockets as we see continued proliferation out into  how are you guys thinking about your market share opportunity andor sort of what the yearly price decline environment might be as this technology broadens out hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp sure so obviously just like any consumer or mobile and a hot market competition is there its been around weve established a lead in market share about   already just for being first to market but obviously theres a lot of new entrants and players in the market today how that position is going to be affected in the second half its all baked in were very well positioned in second half everything is designed in well ramp according to plan  our design win pipeline is very strong im very comfortable for the  but we remain obviously competitive we have a lot of new products coming out we are targeting programmable and integration which both make our sockets very sticky if you remember during analyst day i said as soon as we start seeing commoditization in the lowend of that market my forecast would be first the – potentially the cable and  to  month we will keep plan to maintain the margin but for now over the next  month we have a very solid position and a very sticky position im very comfortable with it john w pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc thats helpful then maybe as my followup for thad personal observation congratulations on good margin leverage both sequentially and yearoveryear i think this is some of the best incremental margins you guys have kind of put up in a while but im kind of curious when i look at free cash flow there still seems to be a pretty big gap between sort of net income and free cash flow so how are you thinking about closing that gap and what target could you share with us over time for free cash flow generation thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp yeah i think what youre seeing right now is youre seeing a little bit of timing lag right now right as you noticed weve put up a solid quarter of earnings  growth we built inventory last quarter in q so if you think about it from a cash standpoint and the cash conversion i think there is a lag to that so as we look forward into q we see strong growth in cash flow – free cash flow we manage the capex very tightly we have been spending a little bit as we brought on the capacity but as you know most of our capex is maintenance a little bit on bringing on this flash capacity but for the most part if i look through q and q i think youre going to see a nice earnings – sorry cash flow growth through the second half of the year as the working capital kind of starts to come through and that cash conversion cycle closes john w pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc any target as a percent of revenue you feel like sharing with us thad thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp no because again i think a lot of its the timing right and i think a lot of it depends on the market dynamics as well in terms of if additional capacity is needed john w pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc perfect thanks guys congratulations again operator thank you sir our next question will come from john vinh of keybanc capital markets your line is open you may begin john vinh  keybanc capital markets inc hey guys thanks for taking my question just a followup question on usbc youd mentioned that in the second half that theres kind of two key areas that you expected to see a ramp one in pcs and the other one in mobile i was wondering if you could talk about how we should be thinking about your blended asps on each of those segments based on the design wins that you guys currently have going into the second half hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp hey john this is hassan there is a wide range of asps for that market we talked about mobile as a segment and ive said it in the past within that segment you have a device in the phone device in the cable device in the charger and device in the dongle et cetera so even within those the variation are anywhere from  to  or  depending on the integration and the level of power that is being delivered by these devices so its not really market dependent it is device dependent and function dependent so the range is – like i said its pretty broad john vinh  keybanc capital markets inc got it thank you and then my followup question is for thad thad you said q guidance  gross margins and youre on track to getting to  by the end of the year with fab utilizations being at  expected to go to  it doesnt seem like youre going to get a lot of tailwinds on increased utilizations can you just maybe walk us through the bridge that remaining  basis points going from q to q thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp yeah well as weve said in the past i mean its literally hundreds of line items thousands of line items that we work on as a company obviously were getting some favorable mix that – it helps on that but more importantly is really the activities that weve been taking inside the company and utilization is one piece of it youve seen that help us in the past and will be a little bit of a tailwind for us as we go forward but we are also looking at the cost structure in our manufacturing sites taking costs out there which is part of the synergy that weve talked about over the years weve got channel consolidation that youve seen us do and that well continue to be looking at in how we engage with our distribution partners around the world weve got additional synergies from the spansion merger that will start to hit through the rest of this year and well get the full benefit of the synergies for the full year and then really it starts to become a optimization of the manufacturing sites right as we outproduction – today were manufacturing about  of our products inside versus  outside and its a matter of finding that right combination of which products go into which facility to maximize gross margin but there is a team here that is focused on this thats working on a lot more detail behind that improving yields taking cost out of our products theres like i said thousands of line items and as we see it right now weve got line of sight to that  john vinh  keybanc capital markets inc great thank you operator thank you sir our next question will come from harsh kumar of stephens your line is open you may begin harsh v kumar  stephens inc yeah hey guys congratulations on stellar execution also on raising the target for iot hassane question for you you talked about plus wins in the pc area for typec i was curious if you could talk maybe in terms of similar numbers or any numbers that you want to share of how the design win traction is for usbc in the back half of this year and then point two of that question is do you think pcs will be bigger for you in usbc exiting this year or you think handsets will be bigger in dollar terms hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp its a very good triangulation question so ill give you a little bit of – some of the items ive talked about in the past all the numbers that we have confidence and full visibility to are already in our guide the mix and the rate at which each segment is going to grow im not talking about those for one main reason is product ramp delays product ramp slope and those – its a brand new ecosystem a lot of new products that are including typec in them im just waiting for the shiftthrough to start happening the sellthrough at our customers to start happening before i can confidently start reporting to you outside of just my visibility from a forecasting side im very comfortable with the forecast and the guide weve given in general and thats based on strength that weve seen in q as far as customer pulling in products we need to – a few weeks from now when customers start pushing out products on to shelves and sell through that we start getting more confidence in the end product ramp as we all know some products will get delayed some products wont some products will make it some wont i think our approach is very well balanced and its included in our guide harsh v kumar  stephens inc okay thanks hassane and then as a followup you talked about the combo chip and you talked about the first joint i guess inhouse cypress combo chip i assume its a wifi plus bluetooth combo chip and so i know that the business you acquired had these before whats so special about this particular one that youre so excited about or am i missing something here hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp sure well the excitement is first the technology and what it provides as far as solution but from where im sitting a lot of people talk about achieving synergies is when you call integration complete the team moving in the building is when you call integration complete but when you have a hightech acquisition and an integration to me when its done is when the team will tape out and introduce a very complex product in the new company and that milestone was achieved in q which is a very big deal of what that means for our future roadmap for our customers we get a lot of questions about what did you get with the acquisition do you have the roadmap do you have the assets that you need the q milestone is very big because it is a stake in the ground saying yes we do and we will keep contributing to the aggressive roadmap that we have acquired and well keep delivering those products within cypress harsh v kumar  stephens inc understood congrats again guys operator thank you sir next question is from the vivek arya from bank of america your line is open you may begin adam gonzalez  bank of america merrill lynch hi guys this is adam gonzalez on for vivek thanks for taking my question first just wanted to touch on q results and i recognize youre better – much better than what youve guided to but q guide seems to be a little bit below seasonal which is  growth im just wondering what are the puts and takes to that and should we expect q to be above trend as well or should we expect it to be seasonally down thanks thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp hi so this is thad so as i stated our business currently is not exhibiting normal seasonality it hasnt all year i think weve outperformed every quarter and if you look at the ramping of the new products the underlying business may still have those seasonal patterns that youve got kind of businesses that are hitting in different quarters that are kind of causing that pattern to not look seasonal so obviously we had big q above seasonal a big q above seasonal and we brought on additional capacity we also saw customers replenishing their inventories that were struggling to get enough inventory from us in the past and if you look forward as i said earlier weve got some products that were just constrained on were not going to have more capacity so youre just not going to be able to get that incremental growth out of it and itll come from our core business and ramping of these new products so as i look forward i think its a stellar q and like i said much higher than what we predicted even  days ago  days ago i was saying itd be slightly better than seasonal if you take that you do the math this is exceptionally higher than what seasonality would have been for q for q i think what youre going to see is a little bit of seasonality because some of the consumer products that will have a holiday build will roll off in q so i think you can think about im not going to call it a seasonal pattern but i think you can see q stepping down slightly from a q baseline just because of some of the ramping products we have in q adam gonzalez  bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks very helpful my second question is on just the automotive market are you guys seeing any impact from the slowdown in us auto sales i understand cypress is a global player but just wanted to see if youve any take on that thanks hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp this is hassane no i mean obviously were monitoring just like every other company who has got  or a big exposure to automotive but i remain confident that our content growth which we reported last quarter but more importantly this quarter with a – the maximum weve ever done in automotive trumps any saar concern that there are in the market specifically in north america we are seeing growth across the board focused on – in europe also where the impact on saar is actually positive so i remain confident in our projections and ill tell you projections that ive given in analyst day including our performance yeartodate well keep monitoring but have no reason for concern automotive is healthy for us operator thank you our next question is from suji desilva from roth capital your line is open you may begin suji desilva  roth capital partners llc hi hassane hi thad a nice job on execution here just want to circle back to the inventory i think youve talked about this indirectly but the level youre at now the  days is that below still the target you guys have of plus and is it because of the tightness or is this kind of more of a level youd like to run at or are you below where youd want to be and what are disti inventories in that situation thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp yeah our target is to be below  days we were at i believe  last quarter so we worked it down to  our target is to be closer to around  days long term it will take us a while to get there were still burning through some of that old inventory its just a matter of having the right mix and the customers where weve been supply constrained are products that we actually dont have in our inventory so well work through those – through that inventory well get down into those levels hopefully mid next year late next year i think well get down into that what i would call a normal operating inventory level but it is a focus for the company and you saw us build inventory last quarter and work it back down this quarter which is what i predicted and then in terms of the disti inventory theres about  weeks in the channel increased from i believe it was  last quarter thats within our range of  to  weeks and kind of at historical levels so we dont see anything ballooning there or anything thats out of the norm to be honest with you suji desilva  roth capital partners llc okay good execution there and then second question is on the mcd market maybe kind of revisiting what you may have talked about at the analyst day whats the organic longterm growth rate we should think about here now that youve folded in the broadcom acquisition and if you give it by subsegment thatll be helpful particularly since usbc has been such a hot topic on this call hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp sure so ill give you the – ill just reiterate the longterm projections we have not changed them from analyst day i think theyre pretty strong and we have confidence in them more confidence now obviously with the results that we just posted end market were looking at auto  to  industrial  to  consumer  to  if you look at it by solution and division were talking mid to highsingledigit for mcd and then mpd weve always talked – theyll be slightly down just because the memory market is slightly down and were offsetting the decline with share gains were still behind that specifically for connectivity ill just reiterate the  to  growth target long term were still confident with that and our design win funnel supports that growth rate suji desilva  roth capital partners llc okay thanks for reviewing that nice job guys thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp thanks operator thank you next question is from charlie anderson of dougherty  company your line is now open charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc yeah thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results and guidance i wanted to dig in a little bit on flash maybe if you guys can just remind us on what portion of memory products is flash at this point and then if i think about the pricing environment i think you said half the customers are longterm deals so should we think about that as maybe half is exposed to that favorable pricing then as i think about it into next quarter are you assuming that favorable pricing keeps happening or when you say flat are you thinking the pricing levels off from the q levels thanks hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp so if i take the two components of the pricing question specifically when we talk about contractual pricing a lot – most of our exposure is auto and industrial those are all contractual theyre multiyear contracts which is the reason we like those markets regardless of products going in to now on the flip side of it when i talk about being opportunistic its on the markets that we have not been going after or we have walked away from and in our terms walking away is you raise prices to where competition will be invited to participate those pricing we still remain opportunistic but its not just about the price and the margin we want sustainable revenue sustainable earnings for that meaning we will service customers that are potentially not necessarily started as focus flash customers but we do crossselling for microcontrollers or wifi or bluetooth and they need memory we will support them with their memory demand at our price in order to generate more earnings so our focus is maintaining our target and our path for the gross margin expansion and if we are able to generate earnings we will go after that business while we maintain the gross margin trajectory so thats kind of the balance that we do as far as being opportunistic about both pricing and supply but the other side of the business where the exposure is in auto and industrial our focus is just to satisfy the customer demand per our original agreements thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp hey charlie its thad so the answer to your question about the flash component of mpd there is give and takes every quarter but on an average its about twothirds of the overall mpd revenue charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc perfect thats what i was thinking and then a quick one on usb typec in terms of the mobile design wins and hassane you mentioned there is a lot of ways you can do that in terms of how much content where you end up i wonder the ones – the design wins that you do have to what degree is there portions of that that you think are susceptible to integration or is everything that youve won something that can sustain for two three years or is more of the burden on you to come up with new features to keep that same content level on those types of sockets thanks hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp yeah i think where we are today i can tell you based on the design and the capability of our product as far as what performance they do within the system that theyre in and the system like i said could be from a cable to a adaptor to a dongle et cetera i see a good strong performance over the next couple of years so thats why i mentioned earlier in the qa im very comfortable with our position and the stickiness of our position both on the designs that well be ramping and the funnel that we have been winning charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc perfect thank you so much operator thank you sir next question is from william stein of suntrust your line is now open you may begin william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thanks for taking my questions first im hoping you can comment on the slightly longer term  op margin – pardon me gross margin target by the end of next year relative to what youre achieving so far this year and reiterating the nearterm goals thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp yeah its thad so as we said weve got  locked and loaded we are comfortable there i rattled off a number of items talking about thousands of line items that we work on every day and that our team is executing on those dont end in december of  so those activities go through  as we look forward obviously it will depend on the macro as well that we believe weve got some favorable mix coming our way as new products come out of rd and start ramping that gives us some nice favorable tailwind and its something well continue to work and execute on so were not changing that target hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp yeah if you look at were going to exit the year with  we have line of sight to that and that mix where the growth is coming from will continue in  you see the new products coming up which will sway the mix overall with a strong foundation that we have been working on the thousands of line items for manufacturing getting cost out which will continue but that will become the baseline that well build upon until – and exit  which we are also maintaining william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thats very helpful one followup if i can i saw in your product announcement or your new – i dont know if its new relationship but you announced a new mcu and i think other product wind with denso for toyota it seemed remarkable to me because i think denso has historically used renaissance and i think its probably very difficult customer for other microcontroller companies to penetrate is this is a new relationship and is this sort of important potentially to your business as it seems or am i overstating it hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp well id give you two answers one is its not a new relationship with us and denso we have a long relationship with denso theyre one of our largest customers in the company today what is new is what you started your question with which is displacing renaissance that has been a trend not just at denso but across multiple other accounts weve been gaining share and thats in addition to just the new content that is being generated in the cars both those are what contributes to our confidence in our longterm targets and our current growth targets specifically for automotive so all of that and if you notice on the denso design its a microcontroller and a flash so that also plays into the crossselling that weve been talking about since the merger and those designs are starting to get to production based on just the design cycle latency that we see in automotive so that now – weve talked about it at the merger time i reported on it as far as progress and design wins and now youre starting to see those designs starting to generate revenue with multiple products and solutions from cypress on the boards of our customers so youll see more of that coming out not just in automotive but across other markets william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thanks operator thank you next question is from craig hettenbach of morgan stanley your line is open you may begin craig m hettenbach  morgan stanley  co llc yes thanks i appreciate the context as you look out into q in terms of seasonality and consumer anything else to add there in terms of usb would that be another help if it extends into q versus typical seasonality thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp craig i think what ive said earlier stepping back i mean that assumes that usbc continues to ramp throughout the year and that would offset some of the decline in the other consumeroriented markets so thats baked in kind of what hassane calls a balanced forecast craig m hettenbach  morgan stanley  co llc got it and then any other commentary thad just around kind of the channel you gave kind of the weeks of inventory just kind of how behavior was as you went through the quarter i know you mentioned lead times a bit but just looking for some context around kind of the cycle and what youre seeing from both distributors and customers michael balow  cypress semiconductor corp yeah so craig this is mike balow our lead times did extend a bit through the quarter on a number of products and distribution has tried to build a little bit of inventory to support some of the longer lead times as thad mentioned earlier with the lead times extending its forced the customers to get more on the books and i think with the general tightness in the market theyre trying to get inventory in place thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp but yeah craig i dont think we saw – other than what mike mentioned i dont think we saw anything outside the norm again that inventory levels are right in our sweet spot consistent with what weve seen in the past we have seen them build some inventory on some of these products that weve been supply constrained on but i think i wouldnt say its anything outside of normal patterns craig m hettenbach  morgan stanley  co llc got it thanks operator thank you next question is from rajvindra gill of needham  company your line is now open rajvindra s gill  needham  co llc thank you and congrats as well on the iot business i know in the past you kind of broke out the percentage from consumer industrial and auto i was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about the split between those three subcategories overall you break out the business by the different end markets so if we can get a sense of whats going on on the connectivity side but just wondering if you have any insight on kind of a split of iot between the consumer industrial and auto thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp yeah yeah the wireless connectivity breaks out to about  automotive which is consistent with what weve been running in the past about  comes kind of in this industrial category and then  which is this broad consumer other right all these devices that are being connected kind of fall into that category that can be things from gaming to toothbrushes to flashlights whatever it may be that are getting connected thermostats but thats essentially the breakout of the business as we see it rajvindra s gill  needham  co llc and the automotive business growing  sequentially and also growing well on a yearoveryear basis how are you specifically tied to the different progressions of adas systems from kind of a dollar content perspective hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp sure so – this is hassane when weve outlined our new strategy i mentioned our focus is enabling all adas system basically really agnostic of the level because were not providing the soc or part of the soc or the periphery as far as in a microcontroller or a programmable fabric but all of these whatever level of autonomy and whatever level of periphery they require a special type of memory and thats where our flash investment and our fresh flash products have been focused which is providing all of the soc vendors and there are a few of them that are in the lead and gaining traction do require external memory its highperformance memory it is secured memory obviously you cant have any potential for a hack or a disturbance being external so we are focusing our investment on these products that provide low power high performance and security those are what our play is in adas today along with all soc vendors our engagement with the oems and with the tier  is at that level we announced a partnership with bosch in the quarter where bosch selected the cypress flash memory the nor flash memory specifically as their memory platform for their adas platform so as you see those products and those systems deploy and ramp we will start engaging and ramping those memories with them so thats been our – so basically it doesnt matter what level accelerates whether level two three four five we will be in as soon as adas in general starts ramping at any level rajvindra s gill  needham  co llc great just last question for me you break out the revenue by end market auto industrial consumer and then you also break it out by solution memory microcontroller connectivity mixed signal so if i did the numbers right i mean it seems like the connectivity grew  sequentially followed by  sequential growth in memory and  in microcontroller were those product segment increases driven across evenly through the different end markets or was there one end market with respect to one different product line where you saw more growth versus the others hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor corp yeah i mean if you look just at our end market composition the industrial and automotive is about  and its been – in the last few quarters its been  so that tells you that a lot of the growth in the quarter was from the consumer basically everything grew but consumer grew a little bit faster across the board and that put the total revenue more on the consumer side as a percent but everything grew like you highlighted rajvindra s gill  needham  co llc great thank you very much thad trent  cypress semiconductor corp thanks rajvi operator thank you sir that will be our last question on queue ill now hand it back to hassane elkhoury for some closing remarks hassane elkhoury  cypress semiconductor

left and trent luckinbill are twin brothers and enid natives who are producing a number of hollywood film projects including “the good lie” photo provided call them the tinsel twins thad and trent luckinbill were born april   in enid and they’ve since gone hollywood and produced their first movie together “the good lie” starring reese witherspoon which opened friday in select cities nationwide “it’s one of those movies that just shows you what’s right about the human spirit and its triumph over tragedy” thad luckinbill said in a phone interview last week from los angeles “we were really proud — especially for our first movie — to be talking about something so important and have such a powerful message of inspiration behind a project like this” said trent luckinbill from new york city on the same day “the good lie” directed by philippe falardeau “monsieur lazhar” from a screenplay by margaret nagle hbo’s “boardwalk empire” is a fictionalized account of south sudanese children orphaned by a brutal civil war in the late s and forced to flee from certain death at the hands of the northern militia some walking up to  miles over treacherous terrain to reach the safety of the kakuma refugee camp in kenya more than a decade later as young adults many of these “lost boys” and girls of sudan are given the opportunity to settle in america this story focuses on the journey of three young men and a girl and their struggle to adapt to stcentury american culture with all of its strange customs and hightech trappings such as telephones and light switches under the guidance of a toughminded but softhearted employment counselor played by witherspoon it’s a movie with the potential to be a very big hit and the production company black label media newly formed by the luckinbill twins and molly smith — a producer whose resume already includes “ps i love you” “something borrowed” and “beautiful creatures” — financed “the good lie” and brought it to life the road to hollywood but it wasn’t an overnight journey from enid to this tinseltown catbird seat the luckinbills now occupy trent earned a law degree at the university of oklahoma and has an extensive legal and financial background in the private and public sectors at the department of treasury’s office of financial stability as a lawyer at the justice department in washington dc and in private equity groups after that thad took a business degree from ou and moved to california where he went to work for a producer and studied acting he’s been a producer and actor for nearly  years perhaps bestknown for his role as jt hellstrom on the cbs soap opera “the young and the restless” when he decided to get really serious about producing and financing bigtime quality films with smith they recruited his brother trent as a partner for his financial expertise “so with trent’s help and the three of us coming together we sort of had the right equation to go forward and were able to pursue it were able to raise the funds and start the company and then we were off to the races” thad said “and ‘the good lie’ was our first project and that came from imagine entertainment which is operated by ron howard and brian grazer who are both producers on the film as well they had the script and we merged with them and were able to finance the film and we creatively produced it” fellow oklahoman howard of course is bestknown as “opie on tv’s “the andy griffith show” and “richie cunningham” on “happy days” not to mention his directing credits on many a major motion picture of the last four decades including “apololo ” “the cinderella man” and “a beautiful mind” the luckinbill twins are hoping “the good lie“ will raise awareness about the ongoing crisis in south sudan where thousands of people are still stuck in refugee camps and civil war has just broken out anew to that end united nations children’s fund has chosen to partner with the producers of “the good lie” in a massive fundraising effort “unicef came on and we started thegoodliefundorg based on the response we were getting to the movie” trent said “we wanted to create a place where people could go and give to the lost boys and girls both in the united states and the refugee camps in south sudan they threw a big new york screening for a lot of the critics and folks here in new york that hadn’t seen it” there was also a special screening in oklahoma city last week for the luckinbills’ friends and family including their parents dennis and anna sue luckinbill who still live in enid busy buddies meanwhile the twins and partner smith have been busy with other projects including “begin again” with keira knightley and mark ruffalo and the british film “” starring jack o’connell frenchcanadian director denis villeneuve’s border war drama “sicario” starring emily blunt josh brolin and benicio del toro has just wrapped in new mexico and shooting is underway in new york for “demolition” directed by jeanmarc valee “dallas buyer’s club” and starring jake gyllenhaal naomi watts and chris cooper the story centers on an investment banker dealing with his emotions following the tragic death of his wife “it’s one of my favorite scripts i’ve read in probably my entire time in hollywood and i really look forward to seeing how it turns out” thad said he also announced that black label media has bought the rights to barry switzer’s autobiography “bootlegger’s boy” with plans to film it in oklahoma “yeah i would relish bringing anything back to oklahoma if we can make it work” thad said meanwhile thad said he will continue to take acting jobs whenever time allows trent on the other hand says he has no intention of stepping in front of a camera again after his experience on an episode of “law  order criminal intent” when he was persuaded to play a corpse with his brother “acting no chance” trent said “i’ve never been interested let me tell you i got armtwisted into that role when i went to visit him on set he was playing both sides of twins and they looked at me and said ‘hey you go lie on that table and you’ll save us a whole lot of visual effects money all we need is one scene one scene we can’t get around’ “and they kind of cornered me into it and against my better judgment i laid there and they said it would be easy and it was the hardest afternoon of my life if there was ever any interest there’s none now but i’ve always been on the legal side and the business side and very interested in the entertainment industry from that perspective i’ll leave acting up to thad” related to
