jacques de molay french də mɔlɛ c  –  march  also spelt molai was the rd and last grand master of the knights templar leading the order from  april  until it was dissolved by order of pope clement v in  though little is known of his actual life and deeds except for his last years as grand master he is one of the best known templars jacques de molays goal as grand master was to reform the order and adjust it to the situation in the holy land during the waning days of the crusades as european support for the crusades had dwindled other forces were at work which sought to disband the order and claim the wealth of the templars as their own king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars had molay and many other french templars arrested in  and tortured into making false confessions when molay later retracted his confession philip had him burned upon a scaffold on an island in the river seine in front of notre dame de paris in march  the sudden end of both the centuriesold order of templars and the dramatic execution of its last leader turned molay into a legendary figure contents  youth  grand master  travel to france  arrest and charges  death  chinon parchment  legends

ordination of jacques de molay in  as a knight templar at the beaune commandery painting by marius granet  little is known of his early years but jacques de molay was probably born in molay hautesaône in the county of burgundy at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire and in modern times in the area of franchecomté northeastern france his birth year is not certain but judging by statements made during the later trials was probably around  he was born as most templar knights were into a family of minor or middleranking nobility it is suggested that he was dubbed a knight at age  in  and is known that he was executed in  aged about  if correct these dates lead to the belief that he was born about  chapel of the beaune commandery nowadays where jacques de molay was ordinated in  as a young man he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house by humbert de pairaud the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche templar master of the province of france around  molay went to the east outremer although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years grand masteredit after the fall of acre to the egyptian mamluks in  the franks a name used in the levant for catholic europeans who were able to do so retreated to the island of cyprus it became the headquarters of the dwindling kingdom of jerusalem and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks who for their part were systematically conquering any last crusader strongholds on the mainland templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin their nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of  molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around  and as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time molay was soon elected in spring  he began a tour of the west to try to muster more support for a reconquest of the holy land developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii edward i of england james i of aragon and charles ii of naples molays immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces from his travels he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to cyprus but could obtain no firm commitment for a new crusade there was talk of merging the templars with one of the other military orders the knights hospitaller the grand masters of both orders opposed such a merger but pressure increased from the papacy it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france at montpellier in  and at arles in  where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of  molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu from  to  molay was engaged in planning and executing a new attack against the mamluks the plan was to coordinate actions between the christian military orders the king of cyprus the nobility of cyprus the forces of cilician armenia and a new potential ally the mongols of the ilkhanate persia to oppose the egyptian mamluks and take back the coastal city of tortosa in syria ghazan the mongol ruler of the ilkhanate sought a francomongol alliance with the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks but was never able to successfully coordinate military actions for generations there had been communications between the mongols and europeans towards the possibility of forging a francomongol alliance against the mamluks but without success the mongols had been repeatedly attempting to conquer syria themselves each time either being forced back by the egyptian mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the mongol empire such as having to defend from attacks from the mongol golden horde to the north in  the ilkhanate again attempted to conquer syria having some preliminary success against the mamluks in the battle of wadi alkhazandar in december  in  molay and other forces from cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the egyptian and syrian coasts the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem the king of cyprus accompanied by his brother amalric lord of tyre and the heads of the military orders with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance the ships left famagusta on  july  and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny raided the coasts of egypt and syria rosetta alexandria acre tortosa and maraclea before returning to cyprus the cypriots then prepared for an attack on tortosa in late  sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of ruad from which raids were launched on the mainland the intent was to establish a templar bridgehead to await assistance from ghazans mongols but the mongols failed to appear in  the same happened in  and  and the island was finally lost in the siege of ruad on  september  eliminating the crusaders last foothold near the mainland following the loss of ruad molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus when a power struggle erupted between king henry ii and his brother amalric the templars supported amalric who took the crown and had his brother exiled in  meanwhile pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders perhaps all placed under the authority of one king and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered travel to franceedit in  the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues which he did during the summer of  molay was opposed to the merger believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position as the missions of each order were somewhat different he was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade it needed to be a large one as the smaller attempts were not effective on  june the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in  though it later had to be postponed due to the popes illness with gastroenteritis molay left cyprus on  october arriving in france in late  or early  however the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the popes illness king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars was in favor of merging the orders under his own command thereby making himself rex bellator or war king molay however rejected the idea philip was already at odds with the papacy trying to tax the clergy and had been attempting to assert his own authority as higher than that of the pope for this one of clements predecessors pope boniface viii had attempted to have philip excommunicated but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy the elderly boniface was rescued but then died of shock shortly thereafter his successor pope benedict xi did not last long dying in less than a year possibly poisoned via philips councillor guillaume de nogaret it took a year to choose the next pope the frenchman clement v who was also under strong pressure to bend to philips will clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers france where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars the grand master of the hospitallers fulk de villaret was also delayed in his travel to france as he was engaged with a battle at rhodes he did not arrive until late summer so while waiting for his arrival molay met the pope to discuss other matters one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on  june  about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured returning to poitiers molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it and the pope convened an inquiry on  august arrest and chargesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message there were five initial charges lodged against the templars the first was renunciation of and spitting on the cross during initiation into the order the second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel posterior and mouth the third was telling the neophyte novice that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly the fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and that this idol was adored in all chapters the fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating mass subsequently the charges would be increased and would become according to the procedures lists of articles  to  in which will be added a few other charges such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order on  september philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on  october philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order molay was in paris on  october where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay wife of count charles of valois and sisterinlaw of king philip in a dawn raid on friday  october  molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested philip then had the templars charged with heresy and many other trumpedup charges most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by

for nearly seven years they had lain to receive the sentence agreed upon by the cardinals in conjunction with the archbishop of sens and some other prelates whom they had called in considering the offences which the culprits had confessed and confirmed the penance imposed was in accordance with rule — that of perpetual imprisonment the affair was supposed to be concluded when to the dismay of the prelates and wonderment of the assembled crowd jacques de molay and geoffroi de charney arose they had been guilty they said not of the crimes imputed to them but of basely betraying their order to save their own lives it was pure and holy the charges were fictitious and the confessions false hastily the cardinals delivered them to the prevot of paris and retired to deliberate on this unexpected contingency but they were saved all trouble when the news was carried to philippe he was furious a short consultation with his council only was required the canons pronounced that a relapsed heretic was to be burned without a hearing the facts were notorious and no formal judgment by the papal commission need be waited for that same day by sunset a pile was erected on a small island in the seine the ile des juifs near the palace garden there de molay de charney de gonneville and de peraud were slowly burned to death refusing all offers of pardon for retraction and bearing their torment with a composure which won for them the reputation of martyrs among the people who reverently collected their ashes as relics note the account varies by one day not unusual for chronicles of the middle ages chinon parchmentedit main article chinon parchment in september  barbara frale found a copy of the chinon parchment in the vatican secret archives a document which explicitly confirms that in  pope clement v absolved jacques de molay and other leaders of the order including geoffroi de charney and hugues de pairaud she published her findings in the journal of medieval history in  another chinon parchment dated  august  addressed to philip iv of france wellknown to historians stated that absolution had been granted to all those templars that had confessed to heresy and restored them to the sacraments and to the unity of the church legendsedit the sudden arrest of the templars the conflicting stories about confessions and the dramatic deaths by burning generated many stories and legends about both the order and its last grand master conquest of jerusalemedit the capture of jerusalem by jacques de molay in  by claudius jacquand versailles musée national chateau et trianons this depiction was commissioned in the s but is about an event in  that did not actually occur there was no battle and molay was nowhere near jerusalem at the time in reality after the christians lost control of jerusalem in  it was not under christian control again until  when the british took it from the ottomans in france in the th century false stories circulated that molay had captured jerusalem in  these rumors are probably related to the fact that the medieval historian the templar of tyre wrote about a mongol general named mulay who occupied syria and palestine for a few months in early  the mongol mulay and the templar molay were entirely different people but some historians regularly confused the two the confusion was enhanced in  when the french playwright and historian françois raynouard made claims that jerusalem had been captured by the mongols with molay in command of one of the mongol divisions in  the grandmaster was with his knights at the recapture of jerusalem this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in  a largescale painting was created by claude jacquand titled molay prend jerusalem  molay takes jerusalem  which depicts the supposed event today the painting hangs in the hall of the crusades in the french national museum of versailles in the  edition of the french encyclopedia the nouvelle biographie universelle it even lists molay as a mongol commander in its molay article jacques de molay was not inactive in this decision of the great khan this is proven by the fact that molay was in command of one of the wings of the mongol army with the troops under his control he invaded syria participated in the first battle in which the sultan was vanquished pursued the routed malik nasir as far as the desert of egypt then under the guidance of kutluk a mongol general he was able to take jerusalem among other cities over the muslims and the mongols entered to celebrate easter — nouvelle biographie universelle molay article  modern historians however state that the truth of the matter is this there are indeed numerous ancient records of mongol raids and occupations of jerusalem from western armenian or arab sources and in  the mongols did achieve a brief victory in syria which caused a muslim retreat and allowed the mongols to launch raids into the levant as far as gaza for a period of a few months during that year rumors flew through europe that the mongols had recaptured jerusalem and were going to return the city to the europeans however this was only an urban legend as the only activities that the mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through palestine which may or may not have even passed through jerusalem itself regardless of what the mongols may or may not have done there is no evidence that molay was ever a mongol commander and he probably never set foot in jerusalem the shroud of turinedit geoffroi de charny the french knight who died at the  battle of poitiers and his wife jeanne de vergy are the first reliably recorded owners of the shroud of turin this geoffroi participated in a failed crusade under humbert ii of viennois in the late s he is sometimes confused with templar geoffroi de charney historical origin of inquisition charge of an idol of a bearded manedit as stated above of the five original accusations made against the knights templars one was the worshipping of an idol of a man with a long beard it specifically states  the cord which the templars wore over the shirt day and night as a symbol of chastity had been consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and this head was adored in the chapters   the image was never found it never mentions the image to be of molay further it seems to describe a rounded idol if it existed at all and was not just a product of torture it could not have been the shroud of turin just by its description there were many early iconic images of a bearded jesus that existed at that time curseedit it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre however the story of the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different templar and those of molay an eyewitness to the execution stated that molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that god would avenge their deaths another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler ferretto of vicenza who applied the idea to a neapolitan templar brought before clement v whom he denounced for his injustice some time later as he was about to be executed he appealed from this your heinous judgement to the living and true god who is in heaven warning the pope that within a year and a day he and philip iv would be obliged to answer for their crimes in gods presence in the event philip and clement v both died within a year of molays execution clement finally succumbing to a long illness on  april  and philip dying due to a stroke while hunting then followed the rapid succession of the last direct capetian kings of france between  and  the three sons and a grandson of philip iv within fourteen years of the death of molay the yearold house of capet collapsed this series of events forms the basis of les rois maudits the accursed kings a series of historical novels written by maurice druon between  and  which was also adapted into two french television miniseries in  and  the american historian henry charles lea wrote even in distant germany philippes death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his deathbed for three great crimes the poisoning of henry vii holy roman emperor and the ruin of the templars and beguines freemasonryedit some  years after the death of de molay and the dissolution of the knights templar the fraternal order of freemasonry began to emerge in northern europe the masons developed an elaborate mythos about their order and some claimed heritage from entities in history ranging from the mystique of the templars to the builders of solomons temple the stories of the templars secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory as described by modern historian malcolm barber in the new knighthood it was during the s that german masons introduced a specific templar connection claiming that the order through its occupation of the temple of solomon had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers which james of molay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenthcentury freemasons were the direct heirs the modern masonic knights templar is an international philanthropic and chivalric order affiliated with freemasonry and begun in ireland perhaps as long ago as  unlike the initial degrees conferred in a masonic lodge which only require a belief in a supreme being regardless of religious affiliation the knights templar is one of several additional masonic orders in which membership is open only to freemasons who profess a belief in the christian religion the full title of this order is the united religious military and masonic orders of the temple and of st john of jerusalem palestine rhodes and malta the story of de molays brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into masonic lore most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged  to  sponsored by freemasonry and named after the last grand master of the knights templar demolay international also known as the order of demolay was founded in kansas city in  by freemason frank s land similar to what happens in freemasonry new members are ceremoniously initiated using degrees that are part of the orders secret ritual authored in the case of the order of demolays ritual by frank a marshall at founder lands request in  the first and less dramatic of the two degrees is called the initiatory degree wherein initiates are escorted around the meeting room and instructed in the precepts and seven cardinal virtues of the order the second of the two degrees known as the demolay degree which along with the initiatory degree members and observers are sworn to keep secret dramatically recreates the trial before a commission in its council chamber of the historic characters named in the ritual as jacques demolay and his three preceptors geoffroi de charney godfrey de goneville and hughes de peralde the demolay degree in which players dress in robes and other period costume and appear on a dimlylit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual is described therein as depicting the tragic climax in the career of jacques demolay the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our order the stage instructions include that the foremost point to be remembered is to portray jacques demolay as the hero and to select an interpretation for the demolay degree which will enhance the lessons of fidelity and toleration the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment however according to the ritual so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission’s verdict and hurried demolay and de charney to the stake on an island near the cathedral where they were barbarously burned referencesedit  jacques de molay britannicacom  a b demurger pp  so no conclusive

except for his last years as grand master he is one of the best known templars jacques de molays goal as grand master was to reform the order and adjust it to the situation in the holy land during the waning days of the crusades as european support for the crusades had dwindled other forces were at work which sought to disband the order and claim the wealth of the templars as their own king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars had molay and many other french templars arrested in  and tortured into making false confessions when molay later retracted his confession philip had him

the beaune commandery painting by marius granet  little is known of his early years but jacques de molay was probably born in molay hautesaône in the county of burgundy at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire and in modern times in the area of franchecomté northeastern france his birth year is not certain but judging by statements made during the later trials was probably around  he was born as most templar knights were into a family of minor or middleranking nobility it is suggested that he was dubbed a knight at age  in  and is known that he was executed in  aged about  if correct these dates lead to the belief that he was born about  chapel of the beaune commandery nowadays where jacques de molay was ordinated in  as a young man he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house by humbert de pairaud the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche templar master of the province of france around  molay went to the east outremer although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years grand masteredit after the fall of acre to the egyptian mamluks in  the franks a name used in the levant for catholic europeans who were able to do so retreated to the island of cyprus it became the headquarters of the dwindling kingdom of jerusalem and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks who for their part were systematically conquering any last crusader strongholds on the mainland templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin their nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of  molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around  and as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time molay was soon elected in spring  he began a tour of the west to try to muster more support for a reconquest of the holy land developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii edward i of england james i of aragon and charles ii of naples molays immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces from his travels he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to cyprus but could obtain no firm commitment for a new crusade there was talk of merging the templars with one of the other military orders the knights hospitaller the grand masters of both orders opposed such a merger but pressure increased from the papacy it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france at montpellier in  and at arles in  where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of  molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu from  to  molay was engaged in planning and executing a new attack against the mamluks the plan was to coordinate actions between the christian military orders the king of cyprus the nobility of cyprus the forces of cilician armenia and a new potential ally the mongols of the ilkhanate persia to oppose the egyptian mamluks and take back the coastal city of tortosa in syria ghazan the mongol ruler of the ilkhanate sought a francomongol alliance with the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks but was never able to successfully coordinate military actions for generations there had been communications between the mongols and europeans towards the possibility of forging a francomongol alliance against the mamluks but without success the mongols had been repeatedly attempting to conquer syria themselves each time either being forced back by the egyptian mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the mongol empire such as having to defend from attacks from the mongol golden horde to the north in  the ilkhanate again attempted to conquer syria having some preliminary success against the mamluks in the battle of wadi alkhazandar in december  in  molay and other forces from cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the egyptian and syrian coasts the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem the king of cyprus accompanied by his brother amalric lord of tyre and the heads of the military orders with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance the ships left famagusta on  july  and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny raided the coasts of egypt and syria rosetta alexandria acre tortosa and maraclea before returning to cyprus the cypriots then prepared for an attack on tortosa in late  sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of ruad from which raids were launched on the mainland the intent was to establish a templar bridgehead to await assistance from ghazans mongols but the mongols failed to appear in  the same happened in  and  and the island was finally lost in the siege of ruad on  september  eliminating the crusaders last foothold near the mainland following the loss of ruad molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus when a power struggle erupted between king henry ii and his brother amalric the templars supported amalric who took the crown and had his brother exiled in  meanwhile pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders perhaps all placed under the authority of one king and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered travel to franceedit in  the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues which he did during the summer of  molay was opposed to the merger believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position as the missions of each order were somewhat different he was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade it needed to be a large one as the smaller attempts were not effective on  june the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in  though it later had to be postponed due to the popes illness with gastroenteritis molay left cyprus on  october arriving in france in late  or early  however the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the popes illness king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars was in favor of merging the orders under his own command thereby making himself rex bellator or war king molay however rejected the idea philip was already at odds with the papacy trying to tax the clergy and had been attempting to assert his own authority as higher than that of the pope for this one of clements predecessors pope boniface viii had attempted to have philip excommunicated but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy the elderly boniface was rescued but then died of shock shortly thereafter his successor pope benedict xi did not last long dying in less than a year possibly poisoned via philips councillor guillaume de nogaret it took a year to choose the next pope the frenchman clement v who was also under strong pressure to bend to philips will clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers france where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars the grand master of the hospitallers fulk de villaret was also delayed in his travel to france as he was engaged with a battle at rhodes he did not arrive until late summer so while waiting for his arrival molay met the pope to discuss other matters one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on  june  about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured returning to poitiers molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it and the pope convened an inquiry on  august arrest and chargesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this

against the templars the first was renunciation of and spitting on the cross during initiation into the order the second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel posterior and mouth the third was telling the neophyte novice that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly the fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and that this idol was adored in all chapters the fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating mass subsequently the charges would be increased and would become according to the procedures lists of articles  to  in which will be added a few other charges such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order on  september philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on  october philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order molay was in paris on  october where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay wife of count charles of valois and sisterinlaw of king philip in a dawn raid on friday  october  molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested philip then had the templars charged with heresy and many other trumpedup charges most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by philips agents against pope boniface viii interrogation of jacques de molay th century print during

been guilty they said not of the crimes imputed to them but of basely betraying their order to save their own lives it was pure and holy the charges were fictitious and the confessions false hastily the cardinals delivered them to the prevot of paris and retired to deliberate on this unexpected contingency but they were saved all trouble when the news was carried to philippe he was furious a

that absolution had been granted to all those templars that had confessed to heresy and restored them to the sacraments and to the unity of the church legendsedit the sudden arrest of the templars the conflicting stories about confessions and the dramatic deaths by burning generated many stories and legends about both the order and its last grand master conquest of jerusalemedit the capture of jerusalem by jacques de molay in  by claudius jacquand versailles musée national chateau et trianons this depiction was commissioned in the s but is about an event in  that did not actually occur there was no battle and molay was nowhere near jerusalem at the time in reality after the christians lost control of jerusalem in  it was not under christian control again until  when the british took it from the ottomans in france in the th century false stories circulated that molay had captured jerusalem in  these rumors are probably related to the fact that the medieval historian the templar of tyre wrote about a mongol general named mulay who occupied syria and palestine for a few months in early  the mongol mulay and the templar molay were entirely different people but some historians regularly confused the two the confusion was enhanced in  when the french playwright and historian françois raynouard made claims that jerusalem had been captured by the mongols with molay in command of one of the mongol divisions in  the grandmaster was with his knights at the recapture of jerusalem this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in  a largescale painting was created by claude jacquand titled molay prend jerusalem  molay takes jerusalem  which depicts the supposed event today the painting hangs in the hall of the crusades in the french national museum of versailles in the  edition of the french encyclopedia the nouvelle biographie universelle it even lists molay as a mongol commander in its molay article jacques de molay was not inactive in this decision of the great khan this is proven by the fact that molay was in command of one of the wings of the mongol army with the troops under his control he invaded syria participated in the first battle in which the sultan was vanquished pursued the routed malik nasir as far as the desert of egypt then under the guidance of kutluk a mongol general he was able to take jerusalem among other cities over the muslims and the mongols entered to celebrate easter — nouvelle biographie universelle molay article  modern historians however state that the truth of the matter is this there are indeed numerous ancient records of mongol raids and occupations of jerusalem from western armenian or arab sources and in  the mongols did achieve a brief victory in syria which caused a muslim retreat and allowed the mongols to launch raids into the levant as far as gaza for a period of a few months during that year rumors flew through europe that the mongols had recaptured jerusalem and were going to return the city to the europeans however this was only an urban legend as the only activities that the mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through palestine which may or may not have even passed through jerusalem itself regardless of what the mongols may or may not have done there is no evidence that molay was ever a mongol commander and he probably never set foot in jerusalem the shroud of turinedit geoffroi de charny the french knight who died at the  battle of poitiers and his wife jeanne de vergy are the first reliably recorded owners of the shroud of turin this geoffroi participated in a failed crusade under humbert ii of viennois in the late s he is sometimes confused with templar geoffroi de charney historical origin of inquisition charge of an idol of a bearded manedit as stated above of the five original accusations made against the knights templars one was the worshipping of an idol of a man with a long beard it specifically states  the cord which the templars wore over the shirt day and night as a symbol of chastity had been consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and this head was adored in the chapters   the image was never found it never mentions the image to be of molay further it seems to describe a rounded idol if it existed at all and was not just a product of torture it could not have been the shroud of turin just by its description there were many early iconic images of a bearded jesus that existed at that time curseedit it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre however the story of the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different templar and those of molay an eyewitness to the execution stated that molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that god would avenge their deaths another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler ferretto of vicenza who applied the idea to a neapolitan templar brought before clement v whom he denounced for his injustice some time later as he was about to be executed he appealed from this your heinous judgement to the living and true god who is in heaven warning the pope that within a year and a day he and philip iv would be obliged to answer for their crimes in gods presence in the event philip and clement v both died within a year of molays execution clement finally succumbing to a long illness on  april  and philip dying due to a stroke while hunting then followed the rapid succession of the last direct capetian kings of france between  and  the three sons and a grandson of philip iv within fourteen years of the death of molay the yearold house of capet collapsed this series of events forms the basis of les rois maudits the accursed kings a series of historical novels written by maurice druon between  and  which was also adapted into two french television miniseries in  and  the american historian henry charles lea wrote even in distant germany philippes death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his deathbed for three great crimes the poisoning of henry vii holy roman emperor and the ruin of the templars and beguines freemasonryedit some  years after the death of de molay and the dissolution of the knights templar the fraternal order of freemasonry began to emerge in northern europe the masons developed an elaborate mythos about their order and some claimed heritage from entities in history ranging from the mystique of the templars to the builders of solomons temple the stories of the templars secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory as described by modern historian malcolm barber in the new knighthood it was during the s that german masons introduced a specific templar connection claiming that the order through its occupation of the temple of solomon had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers which james of molay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenthcentury freemasons were the direct heirs the modern masonic knights templar is an international philanthropic and chivalric order affiliated with freemasonry and begun in ireland perhaps as long ago as  unlike the initial degrees conferred in a masonic lodge which only require a belief in a supreme being regardless of religious affiliation the knights templar is one of several additional masonic orders in which membership is open only to freemasons who profess a belief in the christian religion the full title of this order is the united religious military and masonic orders of the temple and of st john of jerusalem palestine rhodes and malta the story of de molays brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into masonic lore most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged  to  sponsored by freemasonry and named after the last grand master of the knights templar demolay international also known as the order of demolay was founded in kansas city in  by freemason frank s land similar to what happens in freemasonry new members are ceremoniously initiated using degrees that are part of the orders secret ritual authored in the case of the order of demolays ritual by frank a marshall at founder lands request in  the first and less dramatic of the two degrees is called the initiatory degree wherein initiates are escorted around the meeting room and instructed in the precepts and seven cardinal virtues of the order the second of the two degrees known as the demolay degree which along with the initiatory degree members and observers are sworn to keep secret dramatically recreates the trial before a commission in its council chamber of the historic characters named in the ritual as jacques demolay and his three preceptors geoffroi de charney godfrey de goneville and hughes de peralde the demolay degree in which players dress in robes and other period costume and appear on a dimlylit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual is described therein as depicting the tragic climax in the career of jacques demolay the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our order the stage instructions include that the foremost point to be remembered is to portray jacques demolay as the hero and to select an interpretation for the demolay degree which will enhance the lessons of fidelity and toleration the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment however according to the ritual so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission’s verdict and hurried demolay and de charney to the stake on an island near

pope clement v in  though little is known of his actual life and deeds except for his last years as grand master he is one of the best known templars jacques de molays goal as grand master was to reform the order and adjust it to the situation in the holy land during the waning days of the crusades as european support for the crusades had dwindled other forces were at work which sought to disband the order and claim the wealth of the templars as their own king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars had molay and many other french templars arrested in  and tortured into making false confessions when molay later retracted his confession philip had him burned upon a scaffold on an island in the river seine in front of notre dame de paris in march  the sudden end of

external links youthedit ordination of jacques de molay in  as a knight templar at the beaune commandery painting by marius granet  little is known of his early years but jacques de molay was probably born in molay hautesaône in the county of burgundy at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire and in modern times in the area of franchecomté northeastern france his birth year is not certain but judging by statements made during the later trials was probably around  he was born as most templar knights were into a family of minor or middleranking nobility it is suggested that he was dubbed a knight at age  in  and is known that he was executed in  aged about  if correct these dates lead to the belief that he was born about  chapel of the beaune commandery nowadays where jacques de molay was ordinated in  as a young man he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house by humbert de pairaud the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche templar master of the province of france around  molay went to the east outremer although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years grand masteredit after the fall of acre to the egyptian mamluks in  the franks a name used in the levant for catholic europeans who were able to do so retreated to the island of cyprus it became the headquarters of the dwindling kingdom of jerusalem and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks who for their part were systematically conquering any last crusader strongholds on the mainland templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin their nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of  molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around  and as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time molay was soon elected in spring  he began a tour of the west to try to muster more support for a reconquest of the holy land developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii edward i of england james i of aragon and charles ii of naples molays immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces from his travels he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to cyprus but could obtain no firm commitment for a new crusade there was talk of merging the templars with one of the other military orders the knights hospitaller the grand masters of both orders opposed such a merger but pressure increased from the papacy it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france at montpellier in  and at arles in  where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of  molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu from  to  molay was engaged in planning and executing a new attack against the mamluks the plan was to coordinate actions between the christian military orders the king of cyprus the nobility of cyprus the forces of cilician armenia and a new potential ally the mongols of the ilkhanate persia to oppose the egyptian mamluks and take back the coastal city of tortosa in syria ghazan the mongol ruler of the ilkhanate sought a francomongol alliance with the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks but was never able to successfully coordinate military actions for generations there had been communications between the mongols and europeans towards the possibility of forging a francomongol alliance against the mamluks but without success the mongols had been repeatedly attempting to conquer syria themselves each time either being forced back by the egyptian mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the mongol empire such as having to defend from attacks from the mongol golden horde to the north in  the ilkhanate again attempted to conquer syria having some preliminary success against the mamluks in the battle of wadi alkhazandar in december  in  molay and other forces from cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the egyptian and syrian coasts the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem the king of cyprus accompanied by his brother amalric lord of tyre and the heads of the military orders with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance the ships left famagusta on  july  and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny raided the coasts of egypt and syria rosetta alexandria acre tortosa and maraclea before returning to cyprus the cypriots then prepared for an attack on tortosa in late  sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of ruad from which raids were launched on the mainland the intent was to establish a templar bridgehead to await assistance from ghazans mongols but the mongols failed to appear in  the same happened in  and  and the island was finally lost in the siege of ruad on  september  eliminating the crusaders last foothold near the mainland following the loss of ruad molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus when a power struggle erupted between king henry ii and his brother amalric the templars supported amalric who took the crown and had his brother exiled in  meanwhile pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders perhaps all placed under the authority of one king and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered travel to franceedit in  the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues which he did during the summer of  molay was opposed to the merger believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position as the missions of each order were somewhat different he was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade it needed to be a large one as the smaller attempts were not effective on  june the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in  though it later had to be postponed due to the popes illness with gastroenteritis molay left cyprus on  october arriving in france in late  or early  however the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the popes illness king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars was in favor of merging the orders under his own command thereby making himself rex bellator or war king molay however rejected the idea philip was already at odds with the papacy trying to tax the clergy and had been attempting to assert his own authority as higher than that of the pope for this one of clements predecessors pope boniface viii had attempted to have philip excommunicated but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy the elderly boniface was rescued but then died of shock shortly thereafter his successor pope benedict xi did not last long dying in less than a year possibly poisoned via philips councillor guillaume de nogaret it took a year to choose the next pope the frenchman clement v who was also under strong pressure to bend to philips will clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers france where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars the grand master of the hospitallers fulk de villaret was also delayed in his travel to france as he was engaged with a battle at rhodes he did not arrive until late summer so while waiting for his arrival molay met the pope to discuss other matters one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on  june  about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured returning to poitiers molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it and the pope convened an inquiry on  august arrest and chargesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message there were five initial charges lodged against the templars the first was renunciation of and spitting on the cross during initiation into the order the second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel posterior and mouth the third was telling the neophyte novice that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly the fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and that this idol was adored in all chapters the fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating mass subsequently the charges would be increased and would become according to the procedures lists of articles  to  in which will be added a few other charges such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order on  september philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on  october philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order molay was in paris on  october where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay wife of count charles of valois and sisterinlaw of king philip in a dawn raid on friday  october  molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested philip then had the templars charged with heresy and many other trumpedup charges most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by philips agents against pope boniface viii interrogation of jacques de molay th century print during forced interrogation by royal agents at the university of paris on  or  octobercitation needed molay confessed that the templar initiation ritual included denying christ and trampling on the cross he was also forced to write a letter asking every templar to admit to these acts under pressure from

cardinals to paris in december  in front of the cardinals molay retracted his earlier confessions a power struggle ensued between the king and the pope which was settled in august  when they agreed to split the convictions through the papal bull faciens misericordiam the procedure to prosecute the templars was set out on a duality whereby one commission would judge individuals of the order and a different commission would judge the order as a whole pope clement called for an ecumenical council to meet in vienne in  to decide the future of the templars in the meantime the orders dignitaries among them molay were to be judged by the pope in the royal palace at chinon molay was again questioned by the cardinals but this time with royal agents present and he returned to his forced admissions made in  in november  the papal commission for the kingdom of france began its own hearings during which molay again recanted stating that he did not acknowledge the accusations brought

for nearly seven years they had lain to receive the sentence agreed upon by the cardinals in conjunction with the archbishop of sens and some other prelates whom they had called in considering the offences which the culprits had confessed and confirmed the penance imposed was in accordance with rule — that of perpetual imprisonment the affair was supposed to be concluded when to the dismay of the prelates and wonderment of the assembled crowd jacques de molay and geoffroi de charney arose they had been guilty they said not of the crimes imputed to them but of basely betraying their order to save their own lives it was pure and holy the charges were fictitious and the confessions false hastily the cardinals delivered them to the prevot of paris and retired to deliberate on this unexpected contingency but they were saved all trouble when the news was carried to philippe he was furious a short consultation with his council only was required the canons pronounced that a relapsed heretic was to be burned without a hearing the facts were notorious and no formal judgment by the papal commission need be waited for that same day by sunset a pile was erected on a small island in the seine the ile des juifs near the palace garden there de molay de charney de gonneville and de peraud were slowly burned to death refusing all offers of pardon for retraction and bearing their torment with a composure which won for them the reputation of martyrs among the people who reverently collected their ashes as relics note the account varies by one day not unusual for

national chateau et trianons this depiction was commissioned in the s but is about an event in  that did not actually occur there was no battle and molay was nowhere near jerusalem at the time in reality after the christians lost control of jerusalem in  it was not under christian control again until  when the british took it from the ottomans in france in the th century false stories circulated that molay had captured jerusalem in  these rumors are probably related to the fact that the medieval historian the templar of tyre wrote about a mongol general named mulay who occupied syria and palestine for a few months in early  the mongol mulay and the templar molay were entirely different people but some historians regularly confused the two the confusion was enhanced in  when the french playwright and historian françois raynouard made claims that jerusalem had been captured by the mongols with molay in command of one of the mongol divisions in  the grandmaster was with his knights at the recapture of jerusalem this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in  a largescale painting was created by claude jacquand titled molay prend jerusalem  molay takes jerusalem  which depicts the supposed event today the painting hangs in the hall of the crusades in the french national museum of versailles in the  edition of the french encyclopedia the nouvelle biographie universelle it even lists molay as a mongol commander in its molay article jacques de molay was not inactive in this decision of the great khan this is proven by the fact that molay was in command of one of the wings of the mongol army with the troops under his control he invaded syria participated in the first battle in which the sultan was vanquished pursued the routed malik nasir as far as the desert of egypt then under the guidance of kutluk a mongol general he was able to take jerusalem among other cities over the muslims and the mongols entered to celebrate easter — nouvelle biographie universelle molay article  modern historians however state that the truth of the matter is this there are indeed numerous ancient records of mongol raids and occupations of jerusalem from western armenian or arab sources and in  the mongols did achieve a brief victory in syria which caused a muslim retreat and allowed the mongols to launch raids into the levant as far as gaza for a period of a few months during that year rumors flew through europe that the mongols had recaptured jerusalem and were going to return the city to the europeans however this was only an urban legend as the only activities that the mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through palestine which may or may not have even passed through jerusalem itself regardless of what the mongols may or may not have done there is no evidence that molay was ever a mongol commander and he probably never set foot in jerusalem the shroud of turinedit geoffroi de charny the french knight who died at the  battle of poitiers and his wife jeanne de vergy are the first reliably recorded owners of the shroud of turin this geoffroi participated in a failed crusade under humbert ii of viennois in the late s he is sometimes confused with templar geoffroi de charney historical origin of inquisition charge of an idol of a bearded manedit as stated above of the five original accusations made against the knights templars one was the worshipping of an idol of a man with a long beard it specifically states  the cord which the templars wore over the shirt day and night as a symbol of chastity had been consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and this head was adored in the chapters   the image was never found it never mentions the image to be of molay further it seems to describe a rounded idol if it existed at all and was not just a product of torture it could not have been the shroud of turin just by its description there were many early iconic images of a bearded jesus that existed at that time curseedit it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre however the story of the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different templar and those of molay an eyewitness to the execution stated that molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that god would avenge their deaths another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler ferretto of vicenza who applied the idea to a neapolitan templar brought before clement v whom he denounced for his injustice some time later as he was about to be executed he appealed from this your heinous judgement to the living and true god who is in heaven warning the pope that within a year and a day he and philip iv would be obliged to answer for their crimes in gods presence in the event philip and clement v both died within a year of molays execution clement finally succumbing to a long illness on  april  and philip dying due to a stroke while hunting then followed the rapid succession of the last direct capetian kings of france between  and  the three sons and a grandson of philip iv within fourteen years of the death of molay the yearold house of capet collapsed this series of events forms the basis of les rois maudits the accursed kings a series of historical novels written by maurice druon between  and  which was also adapted into two french television miniseries in  and  the american historian henry charles lea wrote even in distant germany philippes death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his deathbed for three great crimes the poisoning of henry vii holy roman emperor and the ruin of the templars and beguines freemasonryedit some  years after the death of de molay and the dissolution of the knights templar the fraternal order of freemasonry began to emerge in northern europe the masons developed an elaborate mythos about their order and some claimed heritage from entities in history ranging from the mystique of the templars to the builders of solomons temple the stories of the templars secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory as described by modern historian malcolm barber in the new knighthood it was during the s that german masons introduced a specific templar connection claiming that the order through its occupation of the temple of solomon had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers which james of molay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenthcentury freemasons were the direct heirs the modern masonic knights templar is an international philanthropic and chivalric order affiliated with freemasonry and begun in ireland perhaps as long ago as  unlike the initial degrees conferred in a masonic lodge which only require a belief in a supreme being regardless of religious affiliation the knights templar is one of several additional masonic orders in which membership is open only to freemasons who profess a belief in the christian religion the full title of this order is the united religious military and masonic orders of the temple and of st john of jerusalem palestine rhodes and malta the story of de molays brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into masonic lore most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged  to  sponsored by freemasonry and named after the last grand master of the knights templar demolay international also known as the order of demolay was founded in kansas city in  by freemason frank s land similar to what happens in freemasonry new members are ceremoniously initiated using degrees that are part of the orders secret ritual authored in the case of the order of demolays ritual by frank a marshall at founder lands request in  the first and less dramatic of the two degrees is called the initiatory degree wherein initiates are escorted around the meeting room and instructed in the precepts and seven cardinal virtues of the order the second of the two degrees known as the demolay degree which along with the initiatory degree members and observers are sworn to keep secret dramatically recreates the trial before a commission in its council chamber of the historic characters named in the ritual as jacques demolay and his three preceptors geoffroi de charney godfrey de goneville and hughes de peralde the demolay degree in which players dress in robes and other period costume and appear on a dimlylit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual is described therein as depicting the tragic climax in the career of jacques demolay the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our order the stage instructions include that the foremost point to be remembered is to portray jacques demolay as the hero and to select an interpretation for the demolay degree which will enhance the lessons of fidelity and toleration the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment however according to the ritual so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission’s verdict and hurried demolay and de charney to the stake on an island near the cathedral where they were barbarously burned referencesedit  jacques de molay britannicacom  a b demurger pp  so no conclusive

except for his last years as grand master he is one of the best known templars jacques de molays goal as grand master was to reform the order and adjust it to the situation in the holy land during the waning days of the crusades as european support for the crusades had dwindled other forces were at work which sought to disband the order and claim the wealth of the templars as their own king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars had molay and many other french templars arrested in  and tortured into making false confessions when molay later retracted his confession philip had him

the beaune commandery painting by marius granet  little is known of his early years but jacques de molay was probably born in molay hautesaône in the county of burgundy at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire and in modern times in the area of franchecomté northeastern france his birth year is not certain but judging by statements made during the later trials was probably around  he was born as most templar knights were into a family of minor or middleranking nobility it is suggested that he was dubbed a knight at age  in  and is known that he was executed in  aged about  if correct these dates lead to the belief that he was born about  chapel of the beaune commandery nowadays where jacques de molay was ordinated in  as a young man he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house by humbert de pairaud the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche templar master of the province of france around  molay went to the east outremer although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years grand masteredit after the fall of acre to the egyptian mamluks in  the franks a name used in the levant for catholic europeans who were able to do so retreated to the island of cyprus it became the headquarters of the dwindling kingdom of jerusalem and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks who for their part were systematically conquering any last crusader strongholds on the mainland templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin their nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of  molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around  and as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time molay was soon elected in spring  he began a tour of the west to try to muster more support for a reconquest of the holy land developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii edward i of england james i of aragon and charles ii of naples molays immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces from his travels he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to cyprus but could obtain no firm commitment for a new crusade there was talk of merging the templars with one of the other military orders the knights hospitaller the grand masters of both orders opposed such a merger but pressure increased from the papacy it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france at montpellier in  and at arles in  where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of  molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu from  to  molay was engaged in planning and executing a new attack against the mamluks the plan was to coordinate actions between the christian military orders the king of cyprus the nobility of cyprus the forces of cilician armenia and a new potential ally the mongols of the ilkhanate persia to oppose the egyptian mamluks and take back the coastal city of tortosa in syria ghazan the mongol ruler of the ilkhanate sought a francomongol alliance with the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks but was never able to successfully coordinate military actions for generations there had been communications between the mongols and europeans towards the possibility of forging a francomongol alliance against the mamluks but without success the mongols had been repeatedly attempting to conquer syria themselves each time either being forced back by the egyptian mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the mongol empire such as having to defend from attacks from the mongol golden horde to the north in  the ilkhanate again attempted to conquer syria having some preliminary success against the mamluks in the battle of wadi alkhazandar in december  in  molay and other forces from cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the egyptian and syrian coasts the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem the king of cyprus accompanied by his brother amalric lord of tyre and the heads of the military orders with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance the ships left famagusta on  july  and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny raided the coasts of egypt and syria rosetta alexandria acre tortosa and maraclea before returning to cyprus the cypriots then prepared for an attack on tortosa in late  sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of ruad from which raids were launched on the mainland the intent was to establish a templar bridgehead to await assistance from ghazans mongols but the mongols failed to appear in  the same happened in  and  and the island was finally lost in the siege of ruad on  september  eliminating the crusaders last foothold near the mainland following the loss of ruad molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus when a power struggle erupted between king henry ii and his brother amalric the templars supported amalric who took the crown and had his brother exiled in  meanwhile pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders perhaps all placed under the authority of one king and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered travel to franceedit in  the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues which he did during the summer of  molay was opposed to the merger believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position as the missions of each order were somewhat different he was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade it needed to be a large one as the smaller attempts were not effective on  june the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in  though it later had to be postponed due to the popes illness with gastroenteritis molay left cyprus on  october arriving in france in late  or early  however the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the popes illness king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars was in favor of merging the orders under his own command thereby making himself rex bellator or war king molay however rejected the idea philip was already at odds with the papacy trying to tax the clergy and had been attempting to assert his own authority as higher than that of the pope for this one of clements predecessors pope boniface viii had attempted to have philip excommunicated but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy the elderly boniface was rescued but then died of shock shortly thereafter his successor pope benedict xi did not last long dying in less than a year possibly poisoned via philips councillor guillaume de nogaret it took a year to choose the next pope the frenchman clement v who was also under strong pressure to bend to philips will clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers france where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars the grand master of the hospitallers fulk de villaret was also delayed in his travel to france as he was engaged with a battle at rhodes he did not arrive until late summer so while waiting for his arrival molay met the pope to discuss other matters one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on  june  about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured returning to poitiers molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it and the pope convened an inquiry on  august arrest and chargesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message there were five initial charges lodged against the templars the first was renunciation of and spitting on the cross during initiation into the order the second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel posterior and mouth the third was telling the neophyte novice that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly the fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and that this idol was adored in all chapters the fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating mass subsequently the charges would be increased and would become according to the procedures lists of articles  to  in which will be added a few other charges such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order on  september philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on  october philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order molay was in paris on  october where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay wife of count charles of valois and sisterinlaw of king philip in a dawn raid on friday  october  molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested philip then had the templars charged with heresy and many other trumpedup charges most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by philips agents against pope boniface viii interrogation of jacques de molay th century print during forced interrogation by royal agents at the university of paris on  or  octobercitation needed molay confessed that the templar initiation ritual included denying christ and trampling on the cross he was also forced to write a letter asking every templar to admit to these acts under pressure from philip iv pope clement v ordered the arrest of all the templars throughout christendom jacques de molay sentenced to the stake in  from the chronicle of france or of st denis fourteenth century note the shape of the island representing the île de la cité island of the city in the seine where the executions took place the pope still wanted to hear molays side of the story and dispatched two cardinals to paris in december  in front of the cardinals molay retracted his earlier confessions a power struggle ensued between the king and the pope which was settled in august  when they agreed to split the convictions through the papal bull faciens misericordiam the procedure to prosecute the templars was set out on a duality whereby one commission would judge individuals of the order and a different commission would judge the order as a whole pope clement called for an ecumenical council to meet in vienne in  to decide the future of the templars in the meantime the orders dignitaries among them molay were to be judged by the pope in the royal palace at chinon molay was again questioned by the cardinals but this time with royal agents present and he returned to his forced admissions made in  in november  the papal commission for the kingdom of france began its own hearings

trials but was finally convened in  on  march  at the council of vienne the order of the knights templar was abolished by papal decree deathedit of molays death henry charles lea gives this account the cardinals dallied with their duty until  march  when on a scaffold in front of notre dame jacques de molay templar grand master geoffroi de charney master of normandy hugues de peraud visitor of france and godefroi de gonneville master of aquitaine were brought forth from the jail in which for nearly seven years they had lain to receive the sentence agreed upon by the cardinals in conjunction with the archbishop of sens and some other prelates whom they had called in considering the offences which the culprits had confessed and confirmed the penance imposed was in accordance with rule — that of perpetual imprisonment the affair was supposed to be concluded when to the dismay of the prelates and wonderment of the assembled crowd jacques de molay and geoffroi de charney arose they had been guilty they said not of the crimes imputed to them but of basely betraying their order to save their own lives it was pure and holy the charges were fictitious and the confessions false hastily the cardinals delivered them to the prevot of paris and retired to deliberate on this unexpected contingency but they were saved all trouble when the news was carried to philippe he was furious a short consultation with his council only was required the canons pronounced that a relapsed heretic was to be burned without a hearing the facts were notorious and no formal judgment by the papal commission need be waited for that same day by sunset a pile was erected on a small island in the seine the ile des juifs near the palace garden there de molay de charney de gonneville and de peraud were slowly burned to death refusing all offers of pardon for retraction and bearing their torment with a composure which won for them the reputation of martyrs among the people who reverently

copy of the chinon parchment in the vatican secret archives a document which explicitly confirms that in  pope clement v absolved jacques de molay and other leaders of the order including geoffroi de charney and hugues de pairaud she published her findings in the journal of medieval history in  another chinon parchment dated  august  addressed to philip iv of france wellknown to historians stated that absolution had been granted to all those templars that had confessed to heresy and restored them to the sacraments and to the unity of the church legendsedit the sudden arrest of the templars the conflicting stories about confessions and the dramatic deaths by burning generated many stories and legends about both the order and its last grand master conquest of jerusalemedit the capture of jerusalem by jacques de molay in  by claudius jacquand versailles musée national chateau et trianons this depiction was commissioned in the s but is about an event in  that did not actually occur there was no battle and molay was nowhere near jerusalem at the time in reality after the christians lost control of jerusalem in  it was not under christian control again until  when the british took it from the ottomans in france in the th century false stories circulated that molay had captured jerusalem in  these rumors are probably related to the fact that the medieval historian the templar of tyre wrote about a mongol general named mulay who occupied syria and palestine for a few months in early  the mongol mulay and the templar molay were entirely different people but some historians regularly confused the two the confusion was enhanced in  when the french playwright and historian françois raynouard made claims that jerusalem had been captured by the mongols with molay in command of one of the mongol divisions in  the grandmaster was with his knights at the recapture of jerusalem this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in  a largescale painting was created by claude jacquand titled molay prend jerusalem  molay takes jerusalem  which depicts the supposed event today the painting hangs in the hall of the crusades in the french national museum of versailles in the  edition of the french encyclopedia the nouvelle biographie universelle it even lists molay as a mongol commander in its molay article jacques de molay was not inactive in this decision of the great khan this is proven by the fact that molay was in command of one of the wings of the mongol army with the troops under his control he invaded syria participated in the first battle in which the sultan was vanquished pursued the routed malik nasir as far as the desert of egypt then under the guidance of kutluk a mongol general he was able to take jerusalem among other

indeed numerous ancient records of mongol raids and occupations of jerusalem from western armenian or arab sources and in  the mongols did achieve a brief victory in syria which caused a muslim

were going to return the city to the europeans however this was only an urban legend as the only activities that the mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through palestine which may or may not have even passed through jerusalem itself regardless of what the mongols may or may not have done there is no evidence that molay was ever a mongol commander and he probably never set foot in jerusalem the shroud of turinedit geoffroi de charny the french knight who died at the  battle of poitiers and his wife jeanne de vergy are the first reliably recorded owners of the shroud of turin this geoffroi participated in a failed crusade under humbert ii of viennois in the late s he is sometimes confused with templar geoffroi de charney historical origin of inquisition charge of an idol of a bearded manedit as stated above of the five original accusations made against the knights templars one was the worshipping of an idol of a man with a long beard it specifically states  the cord which the templars wore over the shirt day and night as a symbol of chastity had been consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and this head was adored in the chapters   the image was never found it never mentions the image to be of molay further it seems to describe a rounded idol if it existed at all and was not just a product of torture it could not have been the shroud of turin just by its description there were many early iconic images of a bearded jesus that existed at that time curseedit it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre however the story of the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different templar and those of molay an eyewitness to the execution stated that molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that god would avenge their deaths another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler ferretto of vicenza who applied the idea to a neapolitan templar brought before clement v whom he denounced for his injustice some time later as he was about to be executed he appealed from this your heinous judgement to the living and true god who is in heaven warning the pope that within a year and a day he and philip iv would be obliged to answer for their crimes in gods presence in the event philip and clement v both died within a year of molays execution clement finally succumbing to a long illness on  april  and philip dying due to a stroke while hunting then followed the rapid succession of the last direct capetian kings of france between  and  the three sons and a grandson of philip iv within fourteen years of the death of molay the yearold house of capet collapsed this series of events forms the basis of les rois maudits the accursed kings a series of historical novels written by maurice druon between  and  which was also adapted into two french television miniseries in  and  the american historian henry charles lea wrote even in distant germany philippes death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his deathbed for three great crimes the poisoning of henry vii holy roman emperor and the ruin of the templars and beguines freemasonryedit some  years after the death of de molay and the dissolution of the knights templar the fraternal order of freemasonry began to emerge in northern europe the masons developed an elaborate mythos about their order and some claimed heritage from entities in history ranging from the mystique of the templars to the builders of solomons temple the stories of the templars secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory as described by modern historian malcolm barber in the new knighthood it was during the s that german masons introduced a specific templar connection claiming that the order through its occupation of the temple of solomon had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers which james of molay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenthcentury freemasons were the direct heirs the modern masonic knights templar is an international philanthropic and chivalric order affiliated with freemasonry and begun in ireland perhaps as long ago as  unlike the initial degrees conferred in a masonic lodge which only require a belief in a supreme being regardless of religious affiliation the knights templar is one of several additional masonic orders in which membership is open only to freemasons who profess a belief in the christian religion the full title of this order is the united religious military and masonic orders of the temple and of st john of jerusalem palestine rhodes and malta the story of de molays brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into masonic lore most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged  to  sponsored by freemasonry and named after the last grand master of the knights templar demolay international also known as the order of demolay was founded in kansas city in  by freemason frank s land similar to what happens in freemasonry new members are ceremoniously initiated using degrees that are part of the orders secret ritual authored in the case of the order of demolays ritual by frank a marshall at founder lands request in  the first and less dramatic of the two degrees is called the initiatory degree wherein initiates are escorted around the meeting room and instructed in the precepts and seven cardinal virtues of the order the second of the two degrees known as the demolay degree which along with the initiatory degree members and observers are sworn to keep secret dramatically recreates the trial before a commission in its council chamber of the historic characters named in the ritual as jacques demolay and his three preceptors geoffroi de charney godfrey de goneville and hughes de peralde the demolay degree in which players dress in robes and other period costume and appear on a dimlylit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual is described therein as depicting the tragic climax in the career of jacques demolay the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our order the stage instructions include that the foremost point to be remembered is to portray jacques demolay as the hero and to select an interpretation for the demolay degree which will enhance the lessons of fidelity and toleration the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment however according to the ritual so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission’s verdict and hurried demolay and de charney to the stake on an island near

pope clement v in  though little is known of his actual life and deeds except for his last years as grand master he is one of the best known templars jacques de molays goal as grand master was to reform the order and adjust it to the situation in the holy land during the waning days of the crusades as european support for the crusades had dwindled other forces were at work which sought to disband the order and claim the wealth of the templars as their own king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars had molay and many other french templars arrested in  and tortured into making false confessions when molay later retracted his confession philip had him burned upon a scaffold on an island in the river seine in front of notre dame de paris in march  the sudden end of

external links youthedit ordination of jacques de molay in  as a knight templar at the beaune commandery painting by marius granet  little is known of his early years but jacques de molay was probably born in molay hautesaône in the county of burgundy at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire and in modern times in the area of franchecomté northeastern france his birth year is not certain but judging by statements made during the later trials was probably around  he was born as most templar knights were into a family of minor or middleranking nobility it is suggested that he was dubbed a knight at age  in  and is known that he was executed in  aged about  if correct these dates lead to the belief that he was born about  chapel of the beaune commandery nowadays where jacques de molay was ordinated in  as a young man he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house by humbert de pairaud the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche templar master of the province of france around  molay went to the east outremer although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years grand masteredit after the fall of acre to the egyptian mamluks in  the franks a name used in the levant for catholic europeans who were able to do so retreated to the island of cyprus it became the headquarters of the dwindling kingdom of jerusalem and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks who for their part were systematically conquering any last crusader strongholds on the mainland templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin their nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of  molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around  and as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time molay was soon elected in spring  he began a tour of the west to try to muster more support for a reconquest of the holy land developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii edward i of england james i of aragon and charles ii of naples molays immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces from his travels he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to cyprus but could obtain no firm commitment for a new crusade there was talk of merging the templars with one of the other military orders the knights hospitaller the grand masters of both orders opposed such a merger but pressure increased from the papacy it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france at montpellier in  and at arles in  where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of  molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu from  to  molay was engaged in planning and executing a new attack against the mamluks the plan was to coordinate actions between the christian military orders the king of cyprus the nobility of cyprus the forces of cilician armenia and a new potential ally the mongols of the ilkhanate persia to oppose the egyptian mamluks and take back the coastal city of tortosa in syria ghazan the mongol ruler of the ilkhanate sought a francomongol alliance with the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks but was never able to successfully coordinate military actions for generations there had been communications between the mongols and europeans towards the possibility of forging a francomongol alliance against the mamluks but without success the mongols had been repeatedly attempting to conquer syria themselves each time either being forced back by the egyptian mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the mongol empire such as having to defend from attacks from the mongol golden horde to the north in  the ilkhanate again attempted to conquer syria having some preliminary success against the mamluks in the battle of wadi alkhazandar in december  in  molay and other forces from cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the egyptian and syrian coasts the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem the king of cyprus accompanied by his brother amalric lord of tyre and the heads of the military orders with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance the ships left famagusta on  july  and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny raided the coasts of egypt and syria rosetta alexandria acre tortosa and maraclea before returning to cyprus the cypriots then prepared for an attack on tortosa in late  sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of ruad from which raids were launched on the mainland the intent was to establish a templar bridgehead to await assistance from ghazans mongols but the mongols failed to appear in  the same happened in  and  and the island was finally lost in the siege of ruad on  september  eliminating the crusaders last foothold near the mainland following the loss of ruad molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus when a power struggle erupted between king henry ii and his brother amalric the templars supported amalric who took the crown and had his brother exiled in  meanwhile pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders perhaps all placed under the authority of one king and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered travel to franceedit in  the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues which he did during the summer of  molay was opposed to the merger believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position as the missions of each order were somewhat different he was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade it needed to be a large one as the smaller attempts were not effective on  june the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in  though it later had to be postponed due to the popes illness with gastroenteritis molay left cyprus on  october arriving in france in late  or early  however the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the popes illness king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars was in favor of merging the orders under his own command thereby making himself rex bellator or war king molay however rejected the idea philip was already at odds with the papacy trying to tax the clergy and had been attempting to assert his own authority as higher than that of the pope for this one of clements predecessors pope boniface viii had attempted to have philip excommunicated but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy the elderly boniface was rescued but then died of shock shortly thereafter his successor pope benedict xi did not last long dying in less than a year possibly poisoned via philips councillor guillaume de nogaret it took a year to choose the next pope the frenchman clement v who was also under strong pressure to bend to philips will clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers france where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars the grand master of the hospitallers fulk de villaret was also delayed in his travel to france as he was engaged with a battle at rhodes he did not arrive until late summer so while waiting for his arrival molay met the pope to discuss other matters one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on  june  about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured returning to poitiers molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it and the pope convened an inquiry on  august arrest and chargesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message there were five initial charges lodged against the templars the first was renunciation of and spitting on the cross during initiation into the order the second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel posterior and mouth the third was telling the neophyte novice that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly the fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and that this idol was adored in all chapters the fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating mass subsequently the charges would be increased and would become according to the procedures lists of articles  to  in which will be added a few other charges such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order on  september philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on  october philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order molay was in paris on  october where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay wife of count charles of valois and sisterinlaw of king philip in a dawn raid on friday  october  molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested philip then had the templars charged with heresy and many other trumpedup charges most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by philips agents against pope boniface viii interrogation of jacques de molay th century print during forced interrogation by royal agents at the university of paris on  or  octobercitation needed molay confessed that the templar initiation ritual included denying christ and trampling on the cross he was also forced to write a letter asking every templar to admit to these acts under pressure from

the shape of the island representing the île de la cité island of the city in the seine where the executions took place the pope still wanted to hear molays side of the story and dispatched two cardinals to paris in december  in front of the cardinals molay retracted his earlier confessions a power struggle ensued between the king and the pope which was settled in august  when they agreed to split the convictions through the papal bull faciens misericordiam the procedure to prosecute the templars was set out on a duality whereby one commission would judge individuals of the order and a different commission would judge the order as a whole pope clement called for an ecumenical council to meet in vienne in  to decide the future of the templars in the meantime the orders dignitaries among them molay were to be judged by the pope in the royal palace at chinon molay was again questioned by the cardinals but this time with royal agents present and he returned to his forced admissions made in  in november  the papal commission for the kingdom of france began its own hearings during which molay again recanted stating that he did not acknowledge the accusations brought

behind the trees any further opposition by the templars was effectively broken when philip used the previously forced confessions to sentence  templars to be burnt at the stake on – may  the council which had been called by the pope for  was delayed for a further two years due to the length of the trials but was finally convened in  on  march  at the council of vienne the order of the knights templar was abolished by papal decree deathedit of molays death henry charles lea gives this account the cardinals dallied with their duty until  march  when on a scaffold in front of notre dame jacques de molay templar grand master geoffroi de charney master of normandy hugues de peraud visitor of france and godefroi de gonneville master of aquitaine were brought forth from the jail in which for nearly seven years they had lain to receive the sentence agreed upon by the cardinals in conjunction with the archbishop of sens and some other prelates whom they had called in considering the offences which the culprits had confessed and confirmed the penance imposed was in accordance with rule — that of perpetual imprisonment the affair was supposed to be concluded when to the dismay of the prelates and wonderment of the assembled crowd jacques de molay and geoffroi de charney arose they had been guilty they said not of the crimes imputed to them but of basely betraying their order to save their own lives it was pure and holy the charges were fictitious and the confessions false hastily the cardinals delivered them to the prevot of paris and retired to deliberate on this unexpected contingency but they were saved all trouble when the news was carried to philippe he was furious a short consultation with his council only was required the canons pronounced that a relapsed heretic was to be burned without a hearing the facts were notorious and no formal judgment by the papal commission need be waited for that same day by sunset a pile was erected on a small island in the seine the ile des juifs near the palace garden there de molay de charney de gonneville and de peraud were slowly burned to death refusing all offers of pardon for retraction and bearing their torment with a composure which won for them the reputation of martyrs among the people who reverently collected their ashes as relics note the account varies by one day not unusual for chronicles of the middle ages chinon parchmentedit main article chinon parchment in september  barbara frale found a copy of the chinon parchment in the vatican secret archives a document which explicitly confirms that in  pope clement v absolved jacques de molay and other leaders of the order including geoffroi de charney and hugues de pairaud she published her findings in the journal of medieval history in  another chinon parchment dated  august  addressed to philip iv of france wellknown to historians stated that absolution had been granted to all those templars that had confessed to heresy and restored them to the sacraments and to the unity of the church legendsedit the sudden arrest of the templars the conflicting stories about confessions and the dramatic deaths by burning generated many stories and legends about both the order and its last grand master conquest of jerusalemedit the capture of jerusalem by jacques de molay in  by claudius jacquand versailles musée national chateau et trianons this depiction was commissioned in the s but is about an event in  that did not actually occur there was no battle and molay was nowhere near jerusalem at the time in reality after the christians lost control of jerusalem in  it was not under christian control again until  when the british took it from the ottomans in france in the th century false stories circulated that molay had captured jerusalem in  these rumors are probably related to the fact that the medieval historian the templar of tyre wrote about a mongol general named mulay who occupied syria and palestine for a few months in early  the mongol mulay and the templar molay were entirely different people but some historians regularly confused the two the confusion was enhanced in  when the french playwright and historian françois raynouard made claims that jerusalem had been captured by the mongols with molay in command of one of the mongol divisions in  the grandmaster was with his knights at the recapture of jerusalem this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in  a largescale painting was created by claude jacquand titled molay prend jerusalem  molay takes jerusalem  which depicts the supposed event today the painting hangs in the hall of the crusades in the french national museum of versailles in the  edition of the french encyclopedia the nouvelle biographie universelle it even lists molay as a mongol commander in its molay article jacques de molay was not inactive in this decision of the great khan this is proven by the fact that molay was in command of one of the wings of the mongol army with the troops under his control he invaded syria participated in the first battle in which the sultan was vanquished pursued the routed malik nasir as far as the desert of egypt then under the guidance of kutluk a mongol general he was able to take jerusalem among other cities over the muslims and the mongols entered to celebrate easter — nouvelle biographie universelle molay article  modern historians however state that the truth of the matter is this there are indeed numerous ancient records of mongol raids and occupations of jerusalem from western armenian or arab sources and in  the mongols did achieve a brief victory in syria which caused a muslim retreat and allowed the mongols to launch raids into the levant as far as gaza for a period of a few months during that year rumors flew through europe that the mongols had recaptured jerusalem and were going to return the city to the europeans however this was only an urban legend as the only activities that the mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through palestine which may or may not have even passed through jerusalem itself regardless of what the mongols may or may not have done there is no evidence that molay was ever a mongol commander and he probably never set foot in jerusalem the shroud of turinedit geoffroi de charny the french knight who died at the  battle of poitiers and his wife jeanne de vergy are the first reliably recorded owners of the shroud of turin this geoffroi participated in a failed crusade under humbert ii of viennois in the late s he is sometimes confused with templar geoffroi de charney historical origin of inquisition charge of an idol of a bearded manedit as stated above of the five original accusations made against the knights templars one was the worshipping of an idol of a man with a long beard it specifically states  the cord which the templars wore over the shirt day and night as a symbol of chastity had been consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and this head was adored in the chapters   the image was never found it never mentions the image to be of molay further it seems to describe a rounded idol if it existed at all and was not just a product of torture it could not have been the shroud of turin just by its description there were many early iconic images of a bearded jesus that existed at that time curseedit it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre however the story of the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different templar and those of molay an eyewitness to the execution stated that molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that god would avenge their deaths another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler ferretto of vicenza who applied the idea to a neapolitan templar brought before clement v whom he denounced for his injustice some time later as he was about to be executed he appealed from this your heinous judgement to the living and true god who is in heaven warning the pope that within a year and a day he and philip iv would be obliged to answer for their crimes in gods presence in the event philip and clement v both died within a year of molays execution clement finally succumbing to a long illness on  april  and philip dying due to a stroke while hunting then followed the rapid succession of the last direct capetian kings of france between  and  the three sons and a grandson of philip iv within fourteen years of the death of molay the yearold house of capet collapsed this series of events forms the basis of les rois maudits the accursed kings a series of historical novels written by maurice druon between  and  which was also adapted into two french television miniseries in  and  the american historian henry charles lea wrote even in distant germany philippes death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his deathbed for three great crimes the poisoning of henry vii holy roman emperor and the ruin of the templars and beguines freemasonryedit some  years after the death of de molay and the dissolution of the knights templar the fraternal order of freemasonry began to emerge in northern europe the masons developed an elaborate mythos about their order and some claimed heritage from entities in history ranging from the mystique of the templars to the builders of solomons temple the stories of the templars secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory as described by modern historian malcolm barber in the new knighthood it was during the s that german masons introduced a specific templar connection claiming that the order through its occupation of the temple of solomon had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers which james of molay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenthcentury freemasons were the direct heirs the modern masonic knights templar is an international philanthropic and chivalric order affiliated with freemasonry and begun in ireland perhaps as long ago as  unlike the initial degrees conferred in a masonic lodge which only require a belief in a supreme being regardless of religious affiliation the knights templar is one of several additional masonic orders in which membership is open only to freemasons who profess a belief in the christian religion the full title of this order is the united religious military and masonic orders of the temple and of st john of jerusalem palestine rhodes and malta the story of de molays brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into masonic lore most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged  to  sponsored by freemasonry and named after the last grand master of the knights templar demolay international also known as the order of demolay was founded in kansas city in  by freemason frank s land similar to what happens in freemasonry new members are ceremoniously initiated using degrees that are part of the orders secret ritual authored in the case of the order of demolays ritual by frank a marshall at founder lands request in  the first and less dramatic of the two degrees is called the initiatory degree wherein initiates are escorted around the meeting room and instructed in the precepts and seven cardinal virtues of the order the second of the two degrees known as the demolay degree which along with the initiatory degree members and observers are sworn to keep secret dramatically recreates the trial before a commission in its council chamber of the historic characters named in the ritual as jacques demolay and his three preceptors geoffroi de charney godfrey de goneville and hughes de peralde the demolay degree in which players dress in robes and other period costume and appear on a dimlylit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual is described therein as depicting the tragic climax in the career of jacques demolay the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our order the stage instructions include that the foremost point to be remembered is to portray jacques demolay as the hero and to select an interpretation for the demolay degree which will enhance the lessons of fidelity and toleration the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment however according to the ritual so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission’s verdict

except for his last years as grand master he is one of the best known templars jacques de molays goal as grand master was to reform the order and adjust it to the situation in the holy land during the waning days of the crusades as european support for the crusades had dwindled other forces were at work which sought to disband the order and claim the wealth of the templars as their own king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars had molay and many other french templars arrested in  and tortured into making false confessions when molay later retracted his confession philip had him

the beaune commandery painting by marius granet  little is known of his early years but jacques de molay was probably born in molay hautesaône in the county of burgundy at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire and in modern times in the area of franchecomté northeastern france his birth year is not certain but judging by statements made during the later trials was probably around  he was born as most templar knights were into a family of minor or middleranking nobility it is suggested that he was dubbed a knight at age  in  and is known that he was executed in  aged about  if correct these dates lead to the belief that he was born about  chapel of the beaune commandery nowadays where jacques de molay was ordinated in  as a young man he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house by humbert de pairaud the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche templar master of the province of france around  molay went to the east outremer although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years grand masteredit after the fall of acre to the egyptian mamluks in  the franks a name used in the levant for catholic europeans who were able to do so retreated to the island of cyprus it became the headquarters of the dwindling kingdom of jerusalem and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks who for their part were systematically conquering any last crusader strongholds on the mainland templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin their nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of  molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around  and as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time molay was soon elected in spring  he began a tour of the west to try to muster more support for a reconquest of the holy land developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii edward i of england james i of aragon and charles ii of naples molays immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces from his travels he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to cyprus but could obtain no firm commitment for a new crusade there was talk of merging the templars with one of the other military orders the knights hospitaller the grand masters of both orders opposed such a merger but pressure increased from the papacy it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france at montpellier in  and at arles in  where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of  molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu from  to  molay was engaged in planning and executing a new attack against the mamluks the plan was to coordinate actions between the christian military orders the king of cyprus the nobility of cyprus the forces of cilician armenia and a new potential ally the mongols of the ilkhanate persia to oppose the egyptian mamluks and take back the coastal city of tortosa in syria ghazan the mongol ruler of the ilkhanate sought a francomongol alliance with the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks but was never able to successfully coordinate military actions for generations there had been communications between the mongols and europeans towards the possibility of forging a francomongol alliance against the mamluks but without success the mongols had been repeatedly attempting to conquer syria themselves each time either being forced back by the egyptian mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the mongol empire such as having to defend from attacks from the mongol golden horde to the north in  the ilkhanate again attempted to conquer syria having some preliminary success against the mamluks in the battle of wadi alkhazandar in december  in  molay and other forces from cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the egyptian and syrian coasts the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem the king of cyprus accompanied by his brother amalric lord of tyre and the heads of the military orders with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance the ships left famagusta on  july  and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny raided the coasts of egypt and syria rosetta alexandria acre tortosa and maraclea before returning to cyprus the cypriots then prepared for an attack on tortosa in late  sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of ruad from which raids were launched on the mainland the intent was to establish a templar bridgehead to await assistance from ghazans mongols but the mongols failed to appear in  the same happened in  and  and the island was finally lost in the siege of ruad on  september  eliminating the crusaders last foothold near the mainland following the loss of ruad molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus when a power struggle erupted between king henry ii and his brother amalric the templars supported amalric who took the crown and had his brother exiled in  meanwhile pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders perhaps all placed under the authority of one king and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered travel to franceedit in  the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues which he did during the summer of  molay was opposed to the merger believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position as the missions of each order were somewhat different he was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade it needed to be a large one as the smaller attempts were not effective on  june the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in  though it later had to be postponed due to the popes illness with gastroenteritis molay left cyprus on  october arriving in france in late  or early  however the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the popes illness king philip iv of france deeply in debt to the templars was in favor of merging the orders under his own command thereby making himself rex bellator or war king molay however rejected the idea philip was already at odds with the papacy trying to tax the clergy and had been attempting to assert his own authority as higher than that of the pope for this one of clements predecessors pope boniface viii had attempted to have philip excommunicated but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy the elderly boniface was rescued but then died of shock shortly thereafter his successor pope benedict xi did not last long dying in less than a year possibly poisoned via philips councillor guillaume de nogaret it took a year to choose the next pope the frenchman clement v who was also under strong pressure to bend to philips will clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers france where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars the grand master of the hospitallers fulk de villaret was also delayed in his travel to france as he was engaged with a battle at rhodes he did not arrive until late summer so while waiting for his arrival molay met the pope to discuss other matters one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on  june  about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured returning to poitiers molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it and the pope convened an inquiry on  august arrest and chargesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message there were five initial charges lodged against the templars the first was renunciation of and spitting on the cross during initiation into the order the second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel posterior and mouth the third was telling the neophyte novice that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly the fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and that this idol was adored in all chapters the fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating mass subsequently the charges would be increased and would become according to the procedures lists of articles  to  in which will be added a few other charges such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order on  september philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on  october philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order molay was in paris on  october where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay wife of count charles of valois and sisterinlaw of king philip in a dawn raid on friday  october  molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested philip then had the templars charged with heresy and many other trumpedup charges most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by philips agents against pope boniface viii interrogation of jacques de molay th century print during forced interrogation by royal agents at the university of paris on  or  octobercitation needed molay confessed that the templar initiation ritual included denying christ and trampling on the cross he was also forced to write a letter asking every templar to admit to these acts under pressure from philip iv pope clement v ordered the arrest of all the templars throughout christendom jacques de molay sentenced to the stake in  from the chronicle of france or of st denis fourteenth century note the shape of the island representing the île de la cité island of the city in the seine where the executions took place the pope still wanted to hear molays side of the story and dispatched two cardinals to paris in december  in front of the cardinals molay retracted his earlier confessions a power struggle ensued between the king and the pope which was settled in august  when they agreed to split the convictions through the papal bull faciens misericordiam the procedure to prosecute the templars was set out on a duality whereby one commission would judge individuals of the order and a different commission would judge the order as a whole pope clement called for an ecumenical council to meet in vienne in  to decide the future of the templars in the meantime the orders dignitaries among them molay were to be judged by the pope in the royal palace at chinon molay was again questioned by the cardinals but this time with royal agents present and he returned to his forced admissions made in  in november  the papal commission for the kingdom of france began its own hearings

previously forced confessions to sentence  templars to be burnt at the stake on – may  the council which had been called by the pope for  was delayed for a further two years due to the length of the trials but was finally convened in  on  march  at the council of vienne the order of the knights templar was abolished by papal decree deathedit of molays death henry charles lea gives this account the cardinals dallied with their duty until  march  when on a scaffold in front of notre dame jacques de molay templar grand master geoffroi de charney master of normandy hugues de peraud visitor of france and godefroi de gonneville master of aquitaine were brought forth from the jail in which for nearly seven years they had lain to receive the sentence agreed upon by the cardinals in conjunction with the archbishop of sens and some other prelates whom they had called in considering the offences which the culprits had confessed and confirmed the penance imposed was in accordance with rule — that of perpetual imprisonment the affair was supposed to be concluded when to the dismay of the prelates and wonderment of the assembled crowd jacques de molay and geoffroi de charney arose they had been guilty they said not of the crimes imputed to them but of basely betraying their order to save their own lives it was pure and holy the charges were fictitious and the confessions false hastily the cardinals delivered them to the prevot of paris and retired to deliberate on this unexpected contingency but they were saved all trouble when the news was carried to philippe he was furious a short consultation with his council only was required the canons pronounced that a relapsed heretic was to be burned without a hearing the facts were notorious and no formal judgment by the papal commission need be waited for that same day by sunset a pile was erected on a small island in the seine the ile des juifs near the palace garden there de molay de charney de gonneville and de peraud were slowly burned to death refusing all offers of pardon for retraction and bearing their torment with a composure which won for them the reputation of martyrs among the people who reverently collected their ashes as relics note the account varies by one day not unusual for chronicles of the middle ages chinon parchmentedit main article chinon parchment in september  barbara frale found a copy of the chinon parchment in the vatican secret archives a document which explicitly confirms that in  pope clement v absolved jacques de molay and other leaders of the order including geoffroi de charney and hugues de pairaud she published her findings in the journal of medieval history in  another chinon parchment dated  august  addressed to philip iv of france wellknown to historians stated that absolution had been granted to all those templars that had confessed to heresy and restored them to the sacraments and to the unity of the church legendsedit the sudden arrest of the templars the conflicting stories about confessions and the dramatic deaths by burning generated many stories and legends about both the order and its last grand master conquest of jerusalemedit the capture of jerusalem by jacques de molay in  by claudius jacquand versailles musée national chateau et trianons this depiction was commissioned in the s but is about an event in  that did not actually occur there was no battle and molay was nowhere near jerusalem at the time in reality after the christians lost control of jerusalem in  it was not under christian control again until  when the british took it from the ottomans in france in the th century false stories circulated that molay had captured jerusalem in  these rumors are probably related to the fact that the medieval historian the templar of tyre wrote about a mongol general named mulay who occupied syria and palestine for a few months in early  the mongol mulay and the templar molay were entirely different people but some historians regularly confused the two the confusion was enhanced in  when the french playwright and historian françois raynouard made claims that jerusalem had been captured by the mongols with molay in command of one of the mongol divisions in  the grandmaster was with his knights at the recapture of jerusalem this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in  a largescale painting was created by claude jacquand titled molay prend jerusalem  molay takes jerusalem  which depicts the supposed event today the painting hangs in the hall of the crusades in the french national museum of versailles in the  edition of the french encyclopedia the nouvelle biographie universelle it even lists molay as a mongol commander in its molay article jacques de molay was not inactive in this decision of the great khan this is proven by the fact that molay was in command of one of the wings of the mongol army with the troops under his control he invaded syria participated in the first battle in which the sultan was vanquished pursued the routed malik nasir as far as the desert of egypt then under the guidance of kutluk a mongol general he was able to take jerusalem among other cities over the muslims and the mongols entered to celebrate easter — nouvelle biographie universelle molay article  modern historians however state that the truth of the matter is this there are indeed numerous ancient records of mongol raids and occupations of jerusalem from western armenian or arab sources and in  the mongols did achieve a brief victory in syria which caused a muslim retreat and allowed the mongols to launch raids into the levant as far as gaza for a period of a few months during that year rumors flew through europe that the mongols had recaptured jerusalem and were going to return the city to the europeans however this was only an urban legend as the only activities that the mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through palestine which may or may not have even passed through jerusalem itself regardless of what the mongols may or may not have done there is no evidence that molay was ever a mongol commander and he probably never set foot in jerusalem the shroud of turinedit geoffroi de charny the french knight who died at the  battle of poitiers and his wife jeanne de vergy are the first reliably recorded owners of the shroud of turin this geoffroi participated in a failed crusade under humbert ii of viennois in the late s he is sometimes confused with templar geoffroi de charney historical origin of inquisition charge of an idol of a bearded manedit as stated above of the five original accusations made against the knights templars one was the worshipping of an idol of a man with a long beard it specifically states  the cord which the templars wore over the shirt day and night as a symbol of chastity had been consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard and this head was adored in the chapters   the image was never found it never mentions the image to be of molay further it seems to describe a rounded idol if it existed at all and was not just a product of torture it could not have been the shroud of turin just by its description there were many early iconic images of a bearded jesus that existed at that time curseedit it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre however the story of the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different templar and those of molay an eyewitness to the execution stated that molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that god would avenge their deaths another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler ferretto of vicenza who applied the idea to a neapolitan templar brought before clement v whom he denounced for his injustice some time later as he was about to be executed he appealed from this your heinous judgement to the living and true god who is in heaven warning the pope that within a year and a day he and philip iv would be obliged to answer for their crimes in gods presence in the event philip and clement v both died within a year of molays execution clement finally succumbing to a long illness on  april  and philip dying due to a stroke while hunting then followed the rapid succession of the last direct capetian kings of france between  and  the three sons and a grandson of philip iv within fourteen years of the death of molay the yearold house of capet collapsed this series of events forms the basis of les rois maudits the accursed kings a series of historical novels written by maurice druon between  and  which was also adapted into two french television miniseries in  and  the american historian henry charles lea wrote even in distant germany philippes death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his deathbed for three great crimes the poisoning of henry vii holy roman emperor and the ruin of the templars and beguines freemasonryedit some  years after the death of de molay and the dissolution of the knights templar the fraternal order of freemasonry began to emerge in northern europe the masons developed an elaborate mythos about their order and some claimed heritage from entities in history ranging from the mystique of the templars to the builders of solomons temple the stories of the templars secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory as described by modern historian malcolm barber in the new knighthood it was during the s that german masons introduced a specific templar connection claiming that the order through its occupation of the temple of solomon had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers which james of molay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenthcentury freemasons were the direct heirs the modern masonic knights templar is an international philanthropic and chivalric order affiliated with freemasonry and begun in ireland perhaps as long ago as  unlike the initial degrees conferred in a masonic lodge which only require a belief in a supreme being regardless of religious affiliation the knights templar is one of several additional masonic orders in which membership is open only to freemasons who profess a belief in the christian religion the full title of this order is the united religious military and masonic orders of the temple and of st john of jerusalem palestine rhodes and malta the story of de molays brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into masonic lore most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged  to  sponsored by freemasonry and named after the last grand master of the knights templar demolay international also known as the order of demolay was founded in kansas city in  by freemason frank s land similar to what happens in freemasonry new members are ceremoniously initiated using degrees that are part of the orders secret ritual authored in the case of the order of demolays ritual by frank a marshall at founder lands request in  the first and less dramatic of the two degrees is called the initiatory degree wherein initiates are escorted around the meeting room and instructed in the precepts and seven cardinal virtues of the order the second of the two degrees known as the demolay degree which along with the initiatory degree members and observers are sworn to keep secret dramatically recreates the trial before a commission in its council chamber of the historic characters named in the ritual as jacques demolay and his three preceptors geoffroi de charney godfrey de goneville and hughes de peralde the demolay degree in which players dress in robes and other period costume and appear on a dimlylit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual is described therein as depicting the tragic climax in the career of jacques demolay the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our order the stage instructions include that the foremost point to be remembered is to portray jacques demolay as the hero and to select an interpretation for the demolay degree which will enhance the lessons of fidelity and toleration the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment however according to the ritual so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission’s verdict and hurried demolay and de charney to the stake on an island near
