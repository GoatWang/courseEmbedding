every year thousands of products are recalled due to poor performance bad quality faulty designs or other defects some manufacturers fail to even take the responsibility of issuing a recall when products don’t perform as promised or advertised this failure is particularly egregious when people are seriously injured or killed as a resultmassachusetts product liability attorneys at the law offices of jeffrey s glassman are dedicated to representing clients in products liability injury lawsuits stemming from defective productsfrom tainted food to defective airbags to malfunctioning appliances the number of recalls in the us has spiked more than  percent over the last decade the consumer product safety commission us food and drug administration and department of agriculture noted a  percent increase in a single year currently we are averaging about  recalls daily or about  each yearin looking solely at pharmaceutical products for example there were a total of  recalls issued in 00 in 0 there were  pharmaceuticals recalled – an increase of nearly  percent in just three years it tapered slightly to  recalled pharmaceuticals in 0examples of defective products includeautomotive products tires brakes child car seats airbags steering columns seat belts etcmedical products pacemakers prosthetic devices hip implants knee implants vaginal mesh etcfood productsfurniturehousehold productsbaby productschildren’s toyselectronicsunderstanding the recall processthe fact that an increasing number of products are being recalled tells us two things the first is that regulators and in some cases manufacturers are getting better at policing safety of these products however it also tells us many products are not meeting required standards which is deeply concerning when we’re talking about the food we eat vehicles we drive beds in which our children sleep and a host of other products we consume or bring into our homesrecalls can be initiated in a number of different ways in some cases it is the manufacturer who discovers an issue sometimes through consumer complaint or report and contacts federal regulators directlyother times inspections of manufacturing facilities turn up evidence of some problem such as unsanitary practices or improper testing this too could lead to a recallin some cases samples of the products tested by federal regulators alert authorities to an irregularity or safety concern for example a child’s toy might contain high levels of lead or a seat belt doesn’t perform as it should to keep passengers safeunfortunately in many cases recalls aren’t initiated until someone is seriously injured sickened or killed as a result of a product’s defect such instances are reported to federal regulators by way of state health departments public safety officials or directly from consumersonce a problem is verified companies may choose to voluntarily issue a recall or regulators may need to put pressure on companies to do so if it’s later determined the company did not act quickly enough to protect consumers regulatory sanctions may be takento be clear a recall does not absolve a company of liability for a defective or dangerous product while consumers do need to be diligent in following recall reports that information isn’t always timely received and regardless the company is still liable for whatever illness or injury their product causestypes of product liability claimsa person who is injured in boston as a result of a defective product will generally have at least one of three claims defective design defective manufacturing or failure to warnwith each claim plaintiff the injured person or surviving loved one will need to showinjury or loss sufferedproduct is defectivedefect caused injury or lossproduct was being used as intended or as was foreseeablethe type of product liability claim you pursue will depend on the individual facts of the casedefective design this is when design of a product is deemed inherently defective or dangerous here the assertion is that the entire line or products is inherently dangerous even though the product was made according to manufacturer specificationsdefective manufacture this is a claim that alleges there was some flaw or error in making a product this usually indicates a problem at the factory level which results from one product or batch of products being different than the others an example would be a contaminated batch of cold medicine or a chainsaw with a missing chain brakefailure to warn this type of claim alleges the company did not provide adequate warning or instruction about proper use or potential problems usually these claims must involve some type of notice of a danger that isn’t obvious to the user contact
