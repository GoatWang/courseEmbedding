growlife roadmap – marco hegyi – mediumhomepagesign in  sign upmarco hegyiblockedunblockfollowfollowingceo and chairman of growlifefeb  growlife roadmapnavigating through opportunitiesphare du petit minou plouzane francelet’s cut to the chase“how hard can it be to grow a company in one of the fastest growing industries” a resonating question i hear repeatedly the answer is that shortterm spikes are relatively easy but to build lasting longterm growth demands more work and thought than most people like to talk about i will share my point of view on an answer and how growlife intends to go big the plan to grow phot revolves around our  roadmap plan from concepts that were explored in  feel free to post your comments and give me feedback all i ask is that you make them constructiveover the last year i challenged our team to push on two business fronts recover our base business and define and pursue some gamechanging expansion opportunities some people may ask why not focus on just one front you could argue if pushing on one is better than many fronts some say “put more wood behind one arrow” but i happen to believe that the opportunities before us are significant and will not be as readily available in the future as they are today loosely translated the cost of buying market share today is less expensive than next year due to increasing competition i also believe that growlife is capable of building more than one business at a time with mergers acquisitions and partnering and recruiting solid available talent finally i believe our shareholders deserve to have us make several bets and not play it safe therefore we are pursuing parallel bets because we have no time to wasteback to the question of how difficult is it to grow a cannabisrelated company there are many types of cannabisbased businesses but for this discussion let’s put the industry companies into two groups those that touch and those that don’t touch the plant touch and nontouch companies touch are cultivators dispensaries packaging ediblemedicinal product makers delivery and distributors nontouch are marketing underlying information systems cash transportation packaging equipmentsupply manufacturers and product suppliers such as growlife let’s next state the obvious performance of nontouch companies are dependent on touch companies this is an important point because the symbiotic dependency means everything and relies on the market price of the plantthe three key business factors of all companies are revenue gross profit margins and growth rate the influencing factors for touch are driven by price per gram or pound set by market demand these then directly affect the revenue and margin for the touch companies growth for nontouch companies are also dependent on the margins from the touch companies which means that if margins are tight for touch companies then the growth rate slows down for the nontouch companiesso why does this matter if the industry is growing at say  shouldn’t the leading companies grow at about the same rate the number of entering competitors creates saturation and lower prices result in lower margins couple these lower margins with lower unit forecasts and it’s a race to the bottom this means that everyone needs to get their operating costs down just to break even and if the plant price greatly drops below a company’s business plan due to saturation investment capital becomes more expensive and hard to getlet’s throw out the mba chatter and simplify with real numbers if a company’s business plan is based on the plant selling for  per pound where it affords margins and growth to their investors…everyone is happy however when the price goes below  and even reaches  all connected companies suffer except those that have great competitive differentiators such as brand reputation patents and innovations that decrease operating costs last year the market hit  even for highquality strains it was a blood bath that not many people want to talk aboutsome cannabis marketing companies grew by keeping their cost of operations and service low and increasing revenue generation resulting in high margins and topline growth those companies did well because industry spending shifted from production to sale of product a few other companies did well because they were able to consolidate market share from competitors but for the most part the industry growth in  hurt more than helped most companies thus  for touch companies such as cultivators is about driving down their cost of operations or cost per gram as low as possible by scaling up operations and streamlining production costsso the answer is that not many companies are making money these days regardless of the industry growth but what is happening is that we are all positioning ourselves to make money as the market grows over the next two years this begs the follow up question how is growlife preparing for profitable growth we are growing base and expansion businesses through the underlying foundations people capital and a differentiating strategyask me why i am still here and i will point you to these three reason last week growlife announced the addition of two board members ms katherine mclain corporate counsel for stripe and the return to the board of mr mark scott growlife cfo also mr darren erasmus a wellrespected cultivation industry leader from house  garden nutrients joined as our national sales manager last month we announced that chicago venture partners our lead investor not only helped consolidate our debt but will continue to stand by us as we seek to expand the company lastly we are solidifying our differentiating strategy by innovating and partnering with strong and wellfinanced groups of investorsbase businessour base business is defined as providing equipment and supplies for indoor cultivation and will continue to build on three distribution channels online ecommerce direct sales and retail stores we remain confident that demand for hydroponic gardening and farming will continue to increase as cannabis legalization permeates the us and the rest of world therefore we will continue to invest in the growth of our base businesshowever we will not be tied to strategies that worked five years ago but instead leverage growlife’s assets to their fullest extent although i have a personal passion for the increasing demand for healthy and locally grown indoor food crops that will require products sold by growlife we will concentrate on serving the more specialized cannabis industry we will apply our competitive advantage in cannabis and help licensed cultivators expand and refine their operationsthis base business provides growlife with a secure and highgrowth foundation especially as we see interest increase for the growlife retail license program that was announced at the end of  this license program creates financial and operating efficiencies for growlife we are shifting our retail store growth from a fixed to variable cost structure which allows us to apply our indoor cultivation competency to other retail partners and reach more cultivators in markets across the us faster the license program offerings range from a storewithinthestore such as the one in place in philadelphia at fairmount hardware an ace hardware franchisee located at  fairmount ave philadelphia pa to partnering with retail investors who set up new growlifelicensed hydroponic stores we are pleased with the initial response and lessons learned over the last eight weeks from the license program which have helped refine our offerings customer engagement and operating processthe other two channels for our base business online ecommerce and direct sales continue to be refined as we invest in them with talent we plan to serve the base with these channels by helping those pricesensitive customers drive down their equipment and supply costs while this puts great pressure on our manufacturers we closely watch metrics move to lowest cost per gram one of the largest cultivators recently shifted their lights from a popular w to w where the electricity savings alone drove down their production cost by  and production inceased by  we explored acquiring the w manufacturer but were unable to agree on a price that made senseexpansion opportunitiesour expansion bets are equally exciting and capable of great revenue growth however expansion bets come with great risk not too different than building a startup our expansion bets are intended to be gamechangersi personally see the cannabis industry as a gamechanger and not just another business or drug many people are discovering great benefits with the plant that are far beyond its commercial growth even with all the government challenges i am confident that both business and consumer will persevere not because of opportunistic suits like myself but because the demand and benefit of the plant are genuine consistent safety measures and standards are definitely on their way but splintering the states with varying policies and pitting them against the federal government continues to contradict the social need therefore i see the greatest opportunities and challenges are in solving these problems…the gamechangersgrowlife will therefore be pursuing such gamechangers in its roadmap to help propel the industry forward on several fronts acquisitions may range from innovations that significantly drive down the operating costs for commercial cultivators to the desperately needed softwareasaservice tools for the government to extensively coordinate its policies with the industry in a safe and responsible manner if we perform as i expect us to we will see some of these expansion gamechangers come to market in  the caveat is that there are many moving parts and all this may or may not come to pass but it will not be for a lack of talent or effortgrowlife’s greatest growth may come from a business that is not a significant contributor today we see three key areas that may be gamechangers for us in  mergers  acquisitions and partnerships map consumer with cube subscription services and plants  seeds each of these areas will require us to add the right people at the right time many talented individuals ready to join growlife are in the pipelinemap in our base business with retail licensing program has quickly taught us to stretch beyond our comfort zone and invest in new procedures and people growth from ma is the most obvious expansion move over the last year i took point on ma and closely looked at over a halfadozen acquisition opportunities my conclusion was that they were all overpriced even after factoring in valuation lift to phot the riskreward did not make sensethe most public example was go green hydroponics where we had entered into a nonbinding letter of intent last year we recently announced in an sec ka filing that the nonbinding letter of intent had expired and growlife does not expect to close the acquisition of go green hydroponics we will therefore not be pursuing this acquisition since our retail strategy has shifted to the growlife retail licensing programsome other ma candidates offered unique and innovative cultivation technologies designed to drive down operating costs for cultivators of any size although we have the financing partners ready to provide the necessary capital we did not see the revenue and margin growth to justify entering into ma debt still there are a couple of deals that we are currently exploringanother area we are continuing to develop is demand from new consumers entering the industry where they seek to learn how to build indoor operations we have tested growlife cube a turnkey subscription service that provides the basic setup for an indoor farming operation growlife provides all the necessary growing equipment and supplies on a monthly subscription basis we estimate that there are millions of consumers without growing experience knowledge and local access to hydroponic equipment and supplies therefore we are tuning growlife cube to more effectively reach these budding consumers to help them be successful we remain confident that this subscription business is the right way to gofinally last month i spent a few days at the seed to sale show in denver to explore the plant and seed business my conclusion is that it is an attractive business that needs to be explored but in an indirect manner growlife is not ready to directly touch the plant we are exploring how to engage it through partners as we do not wish to compete with our customerswhy make such betswe see the indoor cultivation industry as growing faster than other industries due to increasing demand for and legalization of nontoxic pain relief medicines for years growlife has built its brand through experience with leading commercial cultivators we continue to assemble the best team in the industry to create limitless potential our investors and shareholders have shown strong loyalty and support even through difficult times and the growlife and phot brands have maintained an envied publiclytraded base of  shareholders with an average trading volume of about  million shares every day to provide liquiditythe board of directors and management team have solid experience in their own right their diversity and blended value brings collaboration and insight to help us take decisive action every day i learn something from them and they challenge me to bring my a game but frankly that’s not enough if we are going to capitalize on a onceinalifetime market opportunity at growlife we work in two world the here and now and the upcomingwe choose to work towards the highest standards and make the necessary tactical and strategic moves we realize that we are in a zerosum game and our growth must be earned every day call it red ocean or blue ocean our customers have a great deal at stake and having their trust means everything to us therefore we cannot stand still by selling the same old products we must expect to take risks or dieoverall growlife is in a stronger position than it has been for some time with continued work and support we expect to bring growth back to the company and increase shareholder value in  i hope to talk with more shareholders to better understand their perspectives and thoughts on growlife hopefully we can hold some form of shareholder meeting but only if we can do so costeffectively if not i will continue to connect through twitter or let people know when i will be at a

northwest calgary calgary canadagame changing growthgrowlife is growing again but as always we want it faster we must continuously remind ourselves that we are building an industry and not just a company i have been waiting to complete our first half of the year to blog as a follow up on the feb th blog posting of  growlife roadmap however i cannot continue to watch the market and especially our sector decline without speaking up the bottom line is that our industry is being reshaped by a political tug of war between the federal administration and  states that have legalized cannabis these are growing painsin this posting i will address some key questions that have been floating around several bulletin boards about the company  where is growlife headed  what is the company’s vision why  why did growlife form an advisory board  when will we have a shareholder meeting  how can shareholders stay best informedwhere is growlife headinggrowlife is back to revenue growth and survived the decline of  in the fourth quarter of  we began the recovery with a  revenue increase over the previous third quarter of  but one quarter growth is not enough the true test is consistent quarter over quarter growth in the following quarter q  growlife grew  over q  back to back quarterly growth suggests that we are doing something right we arewe are investing in our customers and our team reliable and competitive pricing helps our customers manage down their operating costs which are more important than ever great employee benefits allow us to attract and hire the best people in sales and management continuity and focus allow us to move faster and smarter than we ever havefor example we learned painful yet valuable lessons two years ago when we closed five unprofitable hydroponic brickandmortar stores today we invest in enhancing our online elogistics website that enables customers to get their orders faster better understanding of how to leverage the growlife brand with a storewithinastore business model lead generation programs that touch thousands of cultivator prospects across the country every week and a direct sales team that wins over  of quotes we put out these investments are making a difference in our business performancestill two data points do not make a trend everyone at growlife is working hard every day to deliver constant growth we are almost through q  and aimed at continuing our growth we are now expanding into canada and other high growth markets with local dedicated sales people and we are also increasing our gross profit but to paraphrase what i have said in the past growth for growth’s sake is not a strategywhat is the company’s vision whyperhaps the most asked question i receive is about growlife’s vision and strategic plans to best understand our vision let’s start with our mission growlife is here to help its customers be successful we seek to support this mission by focusing on minimizing the operating costs of indoor cultivators of fruits vegtables and cannabis so they can better serve their marketsbut to what end i can tell you that it’s not about selling cheaper picks and shovels the reason behind this mission is to support a vision that indoor cultivation is an inevitable necessity and not another gardening alternative farming outdoors is cheap because it is a wasteful destructive and inefficient use of precious resources current water land and harvest cycles are limited and if left unchecked will fail to support the world’s population growth however indoor cultivation allows our customers to replicate nature in a controllable manner that uses a fraction of water and land while providing – times the harvest cycles of outdoor the challenge is in getting the economics right subsidies are not the answer even many largescale indoor grow operations with large capital investments have had a difficult time staying in business because the poor economic models fail to deliver a profit fruits and vegetables have limited revenue benefit due to saturated supply from international and domestic growerscannabis on the other hand currently has an attractive revenue model and valuation multiple but modest demand of about  of the population due to shadows cast by interstate commerce restrictions banking issues and threatening federal laws however cannabis laws are not the only expected changes we must prepare for significantly lower prices if cannabis is to become a mainstream alternative to beer wine and other alcohol in the future expecting a  joint to drop to  over the next couple of years is not unreasonabletherefore as an indoor cultivation industry we must lower production costs to provide local safer heathier and affordable food and cannabis crops i see this as the game changer over time we must support a production cost at  of the current price point this means increasing efficiencies scaling up production volumes and driving down indoor operating costs given this vision of the future lowering our customer’s production costs serve as our compass to mergers acquisitions and partnershipsto profitably achieve such a goal i see growlife building out five strategic pillars these pillars represent unfulfilled needs which if capitalized upon can provide phot investors with a lasting diversified portfolio of products and serviceschannel management identify and build distribution channels through our relationships and leverage best practice methodologies to properly target their user segments both supply chain management and local retail partnerships will enable greater customer reach across the country and support services that deliver the necessary supplies on a justintime basistechnology develop the technology partnerships to help with specific solutions whether it is lighting ai monitoring bots tracking id supply chain management or application software each offering must lower costs growlife can then leverage its experience to minimize much of the risk associated with adopting the most efficient solutiondata analysismarket segmentation growlife will extend its reach ranging from large commercial cultivators to asperational novice and caretaker cultivators by leveraging aggregated data from across disparate systems to help companies understand their market demographic and predictive analytics resulting in greater effectiveness of customer acquisitionoperations services through growlife partners we will continue to help customers be more successful we support them in doing what they do best while we can help them handle the cost saving nuances of running a businesseducation growlife seeks to provide all levels of education around bb bc and pp so that we have a selfsupporting ecosystem we are committed to not just providing the fish but teaching all participants in our community how to fishthese pillars enable growlife to acquire and develop additional offerings that will increase customer efficiencies while lowering our costs as the market continues to increase and prices drop we intend to do more than keep pace growlife intends to lead through aggregation of customers and greater cost management for indoor cultivation of cannabis and food industrieswhy did growlife form an advisory boardgrowlife’s advisory board brings a highlyqualified external perspective and priceless expertise to help us gain the unique benefits and advantages needed to support our vision the advisory board’s independence avoids internal daily pressures and invites unparalleled leadership to game changing initiatives our initial four advisory board members include mr william andreozzi former cto of weedmaps mr william blackburn ceo of ez clone enterprises inc mr corey buffkin founder and director of cultivation of greenman cannabis and mr chris herghelegiu investor in several industryrelated growing operationsas i mentioned in their earlier press release i have known and admired these members and can tell you unequivocally that they have no problem pushing back on me when they disagree while the board of directors have governance and compliance responsibilities the advisory board brings their deep indoor cultivation industry experience in marketing operations equipment and technologies to growlife like many of our customers most of the board deal with the constantly changing regulatory challenges in the cannabis industrywe look at many ma deals but find few that make sense for growlife to increase our deal flow we need trusted advisors to help review our plans these advisors must understand the deal domain as well as growlife inside out by more than a financial and governance perspective while we are at the early stage they have already provided great supportmr william andreozzi bill is a handson experienced technology executive that is passionate about leveraging innovative technologies to solve complex problems he’s the type of person that will help with an idea scope out the solution and fearlessly help tackle the challengemr william blackburn billy is the creator of the ezclone plant cloning system and founderpresident of ezclone enterprises inc he has been in the hydroponic industry

chris brings nonstop energy and experience from a multitude of companies in the cannabis space that he has led and contributed to cultivation extraction product development technology and patient acquisition he has held different roles in each operation from investor to ceowhen will we have a shareholder meetingwe have been postponing holding a shareholder meeting for some time because we have had a hard time justifying the  to hold it the reason the cost is so high is that the broker has identified that phot now has over  shareholders this being said we plan to secure the funds and expect to have the shareholder meeting this yearhow can shareholders stay best informedevery quarter we file our quarterly filings six weeks after the close of the quarter at the end of the year december  we file our annual report within  days after our financials are fully audited what most investors may not be aware of is that i write the item  management discussion and analysis mda section in these filings i look closely at the developing market we serve issues and how growlife fits in the market the latest can be found at sec website under item  separately i blog about my perspective on key business issues about every three to six monthsgrowlife is bound by many communication restrictions including putting out too many press releases in the past i have had to explain the materiality of every single press release since  to address concerns that information was consistently being shared shareholders as a result growlife only puts out information in a broad manner to reach our
