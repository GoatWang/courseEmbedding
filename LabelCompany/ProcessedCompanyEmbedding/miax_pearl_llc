inspection published documentthis document has been published in the federal register use the pdf linked in the document sidebar for the official electronic format start preamble december   i introduction on august   miax pearl llc “miax pearl” or “exchange” submitted to the securities and exchange commission “commission” an application for registration as a national securities exchange “form  application” under section  of the securities exchange act of  “exchange act” seeking registration as a national securities exchange under section  of the exchange act notice of the form  application was published for comment in the federal register on september   and the commission received no comments start printed page  ii statutory standards under sections b and a of the act the commission shall by order grant an application for registration as a national securities exchange if the commission finds among other things that the proposed exchange is so organized and has the capacity to carry out the purposes of the act and to comply and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange as discussed in greater detail below the commission finds that miax pearls application for exchange registration meets the requirements of the act and the rules and regulations thereunder further the commission finds that the proposed rules of miax pearl are consistent with section  of the act in that among other things they assure a fair representation of the exchanges members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and provide that one or more directors will be representative of issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer  and that they are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices promote just and equitable principles of trade foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating clearing settling processing information with respect to and facilitating transactions in securities and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general protect investors and the public interest and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers issuers or brokerdealers finally the commission finds that miax pearls proposed rules do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act iii discussion a governance of miax pearl  miax pearl board of directors the board of directors of miax pearl “exchange board” or “miax pearl board” will be its governing body and will possess all of the powers necessary for the management of its business and affairs including governance of miax pearl as a selfregulatory organization “sro” under the bylaws of miax pearl “miax pearl bylaws”  the exchange board will be composed of not less than ten directors  one director will be the chief executive officer of miax pearl  the number of nonindustry directors including at least one independent director will equal or exceed the sum of the number of industry directors  and member representative directors  and at least  of the directors on the exchange board will be member representative directors for the interim board discussed below and subsequently at the first annual meeting and each annual meeting thereafter miami international holdings inc “miami holdings” as the sole llc member of miax pearl will elect the miax pearl board pursuant to the miax pearl bylaws in addition miami holdings will appoint the initial nominating committee  and member nominating committee consistent with each committees compositional requirements to nominate candidates for election to the exchange board each of the nominating committee and member nominating committee after completion of its respective duties for nominating directors for election to the board for that year shall nominate candidates to serve on the succeeding years nominating committee or member nominating committee as applicable additional candidates for the member nominating committee may be nominated and elected by miax pearl members pursuant to a petition process the nominating committee will nominate candidates for each director position and miami holdings as the sole llc member will elect those directors for member representative director positions the nominating committee will nominate those candidates submitted to it and approved by the member nominating committee additional candidates start printed page however may be nominated for the member representative director positions by miax pearl members pursuant to a petition process if no candidates are nominated pursuant to a petition process then the initial nominees submitted by the member nominating committee will be nominated as member representative directors by the nominating committee if a petition process produces additional candidates then the candidates nominated pursuant to the petition process together with those nominated by the member nominating committee will be presented to miax pearl members for a runoff election to determine the final slate of candidates for the vacant member representative director positions in the event of a contested runoff election the candidates who receive the most votes will be nominated as the final slate of member representative director candidates by the nominating committee miami holdings as the sole llc member is obligated to elect the final slate of the member representative director candidates that are nominated by the nominating committee the commission believes that the requirement in the miax pearl bylaws that  of the directors be member representative directors and the means by which they will be chosen by miax pearl members provide for the fair representation of members in the selection of directors and the administration of miax pearl and therefore is consistent with section b of the act the commission notes that this requirement helps to ensure that members have a voice in the use of selfregulatory authority by miax pearl in addition with respect to the requirement that the number of nonindustry directors including at least one independent director will equal or exceed the sum of the number of industry directors and member representative directors the commission believes that the proposed composition of the exchange board satisfies the requirements in section b of the act which requires in part that one or more directors be representative of issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer the commission notes that the inclusion of public nonindustry representatives on exchange oversight bodies is an important mechanism to support an exchanges ability to protect the public interest further the presence of public nonindustry representatives can help to ensure that no single group of market participants has the ability to systematically disadvantage other market participants through the exchange governance process the commission believes that public nonindustry directors can provide unique unbiased perspectives which are designed to enhance the ability of the exchange board to address issues in a nondiscriminatory fashion and foster the integrity of the exchange  interim exchange board prior to commencing operations miami holdings will appoint an interim exchange board of directors “interim exchange board” which will include interim member representative directors with respect to the selection of the interim member representative directors for the interim exchange board prior to the commencement of operations as an exchange miami holdings will submit the names of its nominees for the interim member representative directors positions to persons that have begun the process of becoming members in the new exchange such persons and firms will be allowed  days to submit the names of alternative candidates voting will occur no sooner than  days after the interim election notice is delivered to confirm the final slate of candidates to become an interim member representative director all other interim directors except for the interim member representative directors will be appointed and elected by miami holdings and must meet the miax pearl board composition requirements as set forth in the miax pearl bylaws once these interim member representative directors are seated on the interim exchange board then the interim exchange board will meet the board composition requirements set forth in the governing documents of miax pearl the interim exchange board will serve until the first initial exchange board is elected pursuant to the full nomination petition and voting process set forth in the miax pearl bylaws miax pearl will complete such process within  days after its application for registration as a national securities exchange is granted by the commission the commission believes that the process for electing the interim exchange board as proposed is consistent with the requirements of the act including that the rules of the exchange assure fair representation of the exchanges members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs as noted above miax pearl represents that the initial members of miax pearl will consist substantially of the current group of persons and firms that have begun the membership start printed page application process with miax pearl miax pearl will engage these persons and firms in the interim board election process by prior to the commencement of operations as an exchange providing each of them with the opportunity to participate in the selection of interim member representative directors consistent with the miax pearl bylaws further miax pearl represents that it will complete the full nomination petition and voting process as set forth in the miax pearl bylaws which will provide persons that are approved as members after the effective date of this order with the opportunity to participate in the selection of the member representative directors within  days of when miax pearls application for registration as a national securities exchange is granted therefore the commission believes that miax pearls initial interim board process is consistent with the act including section b in that it is designed to provide representation among the persons and firms likely to become members when miax pearl commences operations and is sufficient to allow miax pearl to commence operations for an interim period prior to going through the process to elect a new exchange board pursuant to the full nomination petition and voting process set forth in the miax pearl bylaws  exchange committees in the miax pearl bylaws the exchange proposed to establish several standing committees which would be divided into two categories committees of the board composed of miax pearl directors and committees of the exchange composed of a mixture of miax pearl directors and persons that are not miax pearl directors the standing committees of the board would be the audit compensation appeals and regulatory oversight committees in addition the exchange chairman with approval of the exchange board may appoint an executive committee and a finance committee which also would be committees of the board the audit committee will consist of three or more directors a majority of which will be nonindustry directors each of the compensation and regulatory oversight committees will consist of three or more directors all of which will be required to be nonindustry directors the appeals committee will consist of one independent director one industry director and one member representative director if established the finance committee will consist of at least three persons who may but are not required to be directors a majority of whom will be nonindustry directors the executive committee if established will consist of at least three directors because the executive committee will have the powers and authority of the exchange board in the management of the business and affairs of the exchange between meetings of the exchange board its composition must reflect that of the exchange board accordingly the number of nonindustry directors on the executive committee must equal or exceed the number of industry directors and the percentages of independent directors and member representative directors must be at least as great as the corresponding percentages on the exchange board as a whole with respect to committees of miax pearl the exchange has proposed to establish a nominating committee  and a member nominating committee as discussed above these committees will have responsibility for among other things nominating candidates for election to the exchange board on an annual basis the members of these committees will nominate candidates for the succeeding years respective committees to be elected by miami holdings as the sole llc member in addition miax pearl has proposed to establish a quality of markets committee which will provide advice and guidance to the exchange board on issues related to the fairness integrity efficiency and competiveness of the information order handling and execution mechanisms of the exchange from the perspective of individual and institutional investors retail and market making firms and other market participants the quality of markets committee will include a broad representation of participants in the exchange additionally at least  of the members of the committee will be member representative members and the number of nonindustry members must equal or exceed the total number of industry and member representative members miax pearl also has proposed to establish a business conduct committee which shall be appointed by the chairman of the exchange board specifically the business conduct committee which will not be a board committee will have a minimum of three members and will be composed of a number of individuals as determined by the exchange chairman none of whom shall be directors of miax pearl in addition at least one member of the business conduct committee and any panel thereof must be an officer director or employee of a miax pearl member the commission believes that miax pearls proposed committees which are similar to the committees maintained by other exchanges are designed to help enable miax pearl to carry out its responsibilities under the act and are consistent with the act including section b which requires in part an exchange to be so organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the act b regulation of miax pearl when miax pearl commences operations as a national securities exchange the exchange will have all the attendant regulatory obligations under the act in particular miax pearl will be responsible for the operation and regulation of its trading system and the regulation of its members certain provisions in the miax pearl and miami holdings governance documents are designed to facilitate the ability of miax pearl and the commission to fulfill their regulatory obligations the start printed page discussion below summarizes some of these key provisions  ownership structure ownership and voting limitations miax pearl will be structured as a delaware limited liability company which will be wholly owned by the sole member of the llc miami holdings the miami holdings proposed amended and restated certificate of incorporation “miami holdings certificate” includes restrictions on the ability to own and vote shares of capital stock of miami holdings these limitations are designed to prevent any miami holdings shareholder from exercising undue control over the operation of miax pearl and to assure that miax pearl and the commission are able to carry out their regulatory obligations under the act in particular for so long as miami holdings directly or indirectly controls miax pearl no person either alone or together with its related persons may beneficially own more than  of any class of capital stock of miami holdings there would be a more conservative restriction for miax pearl members wherein miax pearl members either alone or together with their related persons are prohibited from beneficially owning more than  of shares of any class of capital stock of miami holdings if any stockholder violates these ownership limits miami holdings would redeem the shares in excess of the applicable ownership limit at their par value in addition no person alone or together with its related persons may vote or cause the voting of more than  of the voting power of the then issued and outstanding capital stock of miami holdings if any stockholder purports to vote or cause the voting of shares that would violate this voting limit miami holdings would not honor such vote in excess of the voting limit any person that proposes to own shares of capital stock in excess of the  ownership limitation or vote or grant proxies or consents with respect to shares of capital stock in excess of the  voting limitation must deliver written notice to the miami holdings board to notify the board of its intention the notice must be delivered to the board not less than  days before the proposed ownership of such shares or proposed exercise of such voting rights or the granting of such proxies or consents the miami holdings board may waive the  ownership limitation and the  voting limitation pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the board of directors if it makes certain findings except that the miami holdings board cannot waive the voting and ownership limits above  for miax pearl members and their related persons any such waiver would not be effective unless and until approved by the commission pursuant to section  of the act the miami holdings certificate also contains provisions that are designed to further safeguard the ownership and voting limitation described above or are otherwise related to direct and indirect changes in control specifically any person that either alone or together with its related persons owns directly or indirectly of record or beneficially  or more of the capital stock of miami holdings will be required to immediately notify miami holdings in writing upon acquiring knowledge of such ownership thereafter such persons will be required to update miami holdings of any increase or decrease of  or more in their previously reported ownership percentage the miax pearl llc agreement does not include change of control provisions that are similar to those in the miami holdings certificate however the miax pearl llc agreement explicitly provides that miami holdings is the sole llc member of miax pearl thus if miami holdings ever proposes to no longer be the sole llc member of miax pearl and therefore no longer its sole owner miax pearl would be required to amend the miax pearl llc agreement and the miax start printed page pearl bylaws any changes to the miax pearl llc agreement or the miax pearl bylaws including any change in the provisions that identify miami holdings as the sole owner of miax pearl must be filed with or filed with and approved by the commission pursuant to section  of the act as the case may be further pursuant to the miax pearl bylaws miami holdings may not transfer or assign in whole or in part its ownership interest in miax pearl unless such transfer is filed with and approved by the commission pursuant to section  of the act as described above the provisions applicable to direct and indirect changes in control of miami holdings and miax pearl as well as the voting limitation imposed on owners of miami holdings who also are miax pearl members are designed to help prevent any owner of miami holdings from exercising undue influence or control over the operation of miax pearl in addition these limitations are designed to address the conflicts of interests that might result from a member of a national securities exchange owning interests in the exchange a members interest in an exchange including an entity that controls an exchange could become so large as to cast doubts on whether the exchange may fairly and objectively exercise its selfregulatory responsibilities with respect to such member a member that is a controlling shareholder of an exchange could seek to exercise that controlling influence by directing the exchange to refrain from or the exchange may hesitate to diligently monitor and conduct surveillance of the members conduct or diligently enforce the exchanges rules and the federal securities laws with respect to conduct by the member that violates such provisions as such the commission believes that these voting and ownership limitations are designed to minimize the potential that a person or entity can improperly interfere with or restrict the ability of miax pearl to effectively carry out its regulatory oversight responsibilities under the act the commission believes that miax pearls and miami holdings proposed governance provisions are consistent with the act including section b which requires in part an exchange to be so organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the act in particular these requirements are designed to minimize the potential that a person could improperly interfere with or restrict the ability of the commission or miax pearl to effectively carry out their regulatory oversight responsibilities under the act  regulatory independence and oversight although miami holdings will not itself carry out regulatory functions its activities with respect to the operation of miax pearl must be consistent with and must not interfere with miax pearls selfregulatory obligations in this regard miax pearl and miami holdings propose to adopt certain provisions in their respective governing documents that are designed to help maintain the independence of the regulatory functions of miax pearl these proposed provisions are substantially similar to those included in the governing documents of other exchanges that recently have been granted registration specifically the directors officers employees and agents of miami holdings must give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the selfregulatory function of miax pearl and must not take actions that would interfere with the effectuation of decisions by the miax pearl board relating to its regulatory functions or that would interfere with miax pearls ability to carry out its responsibilities under the act miami holdings must comply with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and agrees to cooperate with the commission and miax pearl pursuant to and to the extent of their respective regulatory authority in addition miami holdings officers directors employees and agents must comply with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and agree to cooperate with the commission and miax pearl in respect of the commissions oversight responsibilities regarding miax pearl and the selfregulatory functions and responsibilities of miax pearl miami holdings and its officers directors employees and agents are deemed to irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the us federal courts the commission and miax pearl for purposes of any action suit or proceeding pursuant to us federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder arising out of or relating to miax pearl activities all books and records of miax pearl reflecting confidential information pertaining to the selfregulatory function of miax pearl including but not limited to disciplinary matters trading data trading practices and audit information shall be retained in confidence by miax pearl and its personnel and will not be used by miax pearl for any nonregulatory purpose and shall not be made available to persons including without limitation any miax pearl member other than to personnel of the commission and those personnel of miax pearl members of committees of miax pearl members of the miax pearl board or hearing officers and other agents of miax pearl to the extent necessary or appropriate to properly discharge the selfregulatory function of miax pearl the books and records of miax pearl and miami holdings must be start printed page maintained in the united states  and to the extent they are related to the operation or administration of miax pearl miami holdings books and records will be subject at all times to inspection and copying by the commission furthermore to the extent they relate to the activities of miax pearl the books records premises officers directors employees and agents of miami holdings will be deemed to be the books records premises officers directors employees and agents of miax pearl for purposes of and subject to oversight pursuant to the act miami holdings will take necessary steps to cause its officers directors employees and agents prior to accepting a position as an officer director employee or agent as applicable to consent in writing to the applicability of provisions regarding books and records confidentiality jurisdiction and regulatory obligations with respect to their activities related to miax pearl miami holdings certificate and bylaws require that so long as miami holdings controls miax pearl any changes to those documents be submitted to the miax pearl board and if such change is required to be filed with the commission pursuant to section b of the act and the rules and regulations thereunder such change shall not be effective until filed with or filed with and approved by the commission the commission believes that the provisions discussed in this section which are designed to help maintain the independence of miax pearls regulatory function and help facilitate the ability of miax pearl to carry out its regulatory responsibilities and operate in a manner consistent with the act are appropriate and consistent with the requirements of the act particularly with section b which requires in part an exchange to be so organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the act whether miax pearl operates in compliance with the act however depends on how it and miami holdings in practice

excuse has failed to enforce compliance” with any such provision by its members including associated persons thereof if commission staff were to find or become aware of through staff review and inspection or otherwise facts indicating any violations of the act including without limitation sections b and g these matters could provide the basis for a disciplinary proceeding under section h of the act the commission also notes that even in the absence of the governance provisions described above under section a of the act any person with a controlling interest in miax pearl would be jointly and severally liable with and to the same extent that miax pearl is liable under any provision of the act unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action in addition section e of the act creates aiding and abetting liability for any person who knowingly provides substantial assistance to another person in violation of any provision of the act or rule thereunder further section c of the act authorizes the commission to enter a ceaseanddesist order against any person who has been “a

and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange the discussion below summarizes how miax pearl proposes to structure and conduct its regulatory operations a regulatory oversight committee the regulatory operations of miax pearl will be monitored by the regulatory oversight committee of the exchange board the regulatory oversight committee will consist of at least three directors all of whom will be nonindustry directors the regulatory oversight committee will be responsible for overseeing the adequacy and effectiveness of miax pearls regulatory and sro responsibilities assessing miax pearls regulatory performance and assisting the exchange board and committees of the exchange board in reviewing miax pearls regulatory plan and the overall effectiveness of miax pearls regulatory functions further a chief regulatory officer “cro” of miax pearl will have general daytoday supervision over miax pearls regulatory operations the regulatory oversight committee also will be responsible for recommending compensation and personnel actions involving the cro and senior regulatory personnel to the compensation committee of miax pearl for action the cro will report to the regulatory oversight committee b regulatory funding to help assure the commission that it has and will continue to have adequate funding to be able to meet its responsibilities under the act miax pearl represents in its form  application that prior to beginning operations as a national securities exchange miami holdings will provide sufficient funding to miax pearl for the exchange to carry out its start printed page responsibilities under the act specifically miax pearl represents that miami holdings has allocated sufficient operational assets to enable its operation and that prior to launching operations miami holdings will make a capital contribution of not less than  into miax pearls capital account in addition to any previouslyprovided inkind contributions such as legal regulatory and infrastructurerelated services miax pearl represents that such cash and inkind contributions by miami holdings will be adequate to begin operation of the exchange including the regulation of the exchange miax pearl also represents in its form  application that there is a written agreement between miax pearl and miami holdings that requires miami holdings to provide adequate funding for miax pearls ongoing operations including the regulation of miax pearl this agreement provides that miax pearl will receive all fees including regulatory fees and trading fees payable by miax pearls members as well as any funds received from any applicable market data fees and opra tape revenue the agreement further provides that miami holdings will reimburse miax pearl for its costs and expenses to the extent miax pearls assets are insufficient to meets its costs and expenses further any revenues received by miax pearl from fees derived from its regulatory function or regulatory penalties will not be used for nonregulatory purposes any excess funds as determined by miax pearl may be remitted to miami holdings however “regulatory funds” will not be remitted to miami holdings c rule d agreements regulatory contract with finra unless the sro is relieved of this responsibility pursuant to section d or section g of the act section g of the act among other things requires every sro registered as a national securities exchange absent reasonable justification or excuse to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the act the rules and regulations thereunder and the sros own rules section d of the act and rule d thereunder permit sros to propose joint plans to allocate regulatory responsibilities among themselves for their common rules with respect to their common members these agreements which must be filed with and declared effective by the commission generally cover areas where each sros rules substantively overlap including such regulatory functions as personnel registration and sales practices without this relief the statutory obligation of each individual sro could result in a pattern of multiple examinations of brokerdealers that maintain memberships in more than one sro such regulatory duplication would add unnecessary expense for common members and their sros a d plan that is declared effective by the commission relieves the specified sro of those regulatory responsibilities allocated by the plan to another sro many sros have entered into rule d agreements a d plan that is declared effective by the commission relieves the specified sro of those regulatory responsibilities allocated by the plan to another sro miax pearl has represented to the commission that it intends to become a party to the existing multiparty options rule d plans concerning sales practice regulation and market surveillance miax pearl has also represented that it will enter into a bilateral d agreement to allocate regulatory responsibility to finra for common rules of dual members between miax pearl and finra under these agreements the examining sros will examine firms that are common members of miax pearl and the particular examining sro for compliance with certain provisions of the act certain rules and regulations adopted thereunder and certain miax pearl rules in addition miax pearl has represented that it will enter into a regulatory services agreement “rsa” with finra under which finra will perform certain regulatory functions on behalf of miax pearl pursuant to the rsa finra in its capacity as service provider to miax pearl will perform various services on miax pearls behalf including assisting miax pearl with member registration and related administrative support services certain crossmarket surveillance services certain options trading examinations at miax pearls request investigating potential violations of enumerated miax pearl market rules as well as federal securities laws and rules and regulations thereunder related to miax pearl market activity performing examinations of options including routine and for cause examinations of start printed page miax pearl members under certain miax pearl rules and federal securities laws bringing formal disciplinary actions including hearing officer services and providing arbitration mediation and other dispute resolution services to miax pearl member firms notwithstanding the rsa miax pearl as an sro has the ultimate legal responsibility for the regulation of its members and market the commission believes that it is consistent with the act for miax pearl to contract with other sros to perform certain examination enforcement and disciplinary functions this regulatory structure would be consistent with that of other sros these functions are fundamental elements of a regulatory program and constitute core selfregulatory functions the commission believes that finra as an sro that provides contractual services to other sros should have the capacity to perform these functions for miax pearl however miax pearl unless relieved by the commission of its responsibility bears the ultimate responsibility for selfregulatory responsibilities and primary liability for selfregulatory failures not the sro retained to perform regulatory functions on miax pearls behalf in performing these regulatory functions however the sro retained to perform regulatory functions may nonetheless bear liability for causing or aiding and abetting the failure of miax pearl to perform its regulatory functions accordingly although finra will not act on its own behalf in carrying out these regulatory services for miax pearl as the sro retained to perform certain regulatory functions finra may have secondary liability if for example the commission finds that the contracted functions are being performed so inadequately as to cause a violation of the federal securities laws by miax pearl c trading system  access to miax pearl access to miax pearl will be granted to individuals or organizations who are approved to become members approved members will be issued trading permits that grant the member the ability to transact on miax pearl through its electronic systems trading permits will not convey upon members any ownership interest in miax pearl and they will not be transferable except in cases where a member experiences a change in control or corporate reorganization membership will be open to any brokerdealer that  is registered under section  of the act  and  has and maintains membership in another registered options exchange other than the miax exchange or finra as explained below a holder of a miax exchange trading permit will not be required to submit a full application for membership on miax pearl there will be no limit to the number of trading permits that miax pearl can issue although miax pearl could determine in the future a limit or decrease in the number of trading permits issued members of miax pearl may be market makers or they may be eems a holder of a miax exchange trading permit in good standing will be eligible to receive one miax pearl trading permit miax exchange member applicants will not be required to submit a full application for membership on miax pearl but rather will only need to complete selected miax pearl forms concerning their election to trade on miax pearl consent to miax pearls jurisdiction and other operational matters this waivein application process is similar to arrangements in place at other exchanges nonmiax exchange members seeking to become members of miax pearl would submit a full application in accordance with procedures established by the exchange entities that become members and their associated persons will be required to meet and maintain certain qualification and registration criteria similar to what is required by other options exchanges in addition miax pearl proposes further requirements on members that seek to do business with start printed page the public applicants who are denied membership may appeal miax pearls decision pursuant to miax pearls rules governing hearings review and arbitration every member will be subject to miax pearls regulatory jurisdiction including miax pearls disciplinary jurisdiction the commission finds that miax pearls proposed membership rules are consistent with the act including section b of the act which requires the rules of an exchange to provide that any registered broker or dealer or natural person associated with a broker or dealer may become a member of such exchange or associated with a member thereof miax pearls proposed rules with respect to exchange membership are substantively similar to the rules of other exchanges the commission notes that pursuant to section c of the act an exchange must deny membership to any person other than a natural person that is not a registered broker or dealer any natural person that is not or is not associated with a registered broker or dealer and registered brokerdealers that do not satisfy certain standards such as financial responsibility or operational capacity as a registered exchange miax pearl must independently determine if an applicant satisfies the standards set forth in the act regardless of whether an applicant is a member of another sro in addition members may enter into arrangements with other parties including nonmembers and other members to provide “sponsored access” to trading on miax pearl members who provide such sponsored access will be responsible for all trading conducted pursuant to the access agreement and to the same extent as if the member were trading directly accordingly members that provide sponsored access must maintain and implement policies and procedures to supervise and monitor sponsored trading activity additionally nonmembers who seek to trade on miax pearl through sponsored access agreements will need to agree to comply with all applicable federal securities laws and rules and exchange rules miax pearls rules governing sponsored access arrangements are similar to the rules of other exchanges  linkage miax pearl intends to become a participant in the plan relating to options order protection and lockedcrossed markets or any successor plan “linkage plan” if admitted as a participant to the linkage plan other plan participants would be able to send orders to miax pearl in accordance with the terms of the plan as applied to the exchange the miax pearl rules include relevant definitions establish the conditions pursuant to which members may enter orders in accordance with the linkage plan impose obligations on the exchange regarding how it must process incoming orders establish a general standard that members and miax pearl should avoid tradethroughs establish potential regulatory liability for members that engage in a pattern or practice of trading through other exchanges and establish obligations with respect to locked and crossed markets the commission believes that miax pearl has proposed rules that are designed to comply with the requirements of the linkage plan further as provided below before miax pearl can commence operations as a national securities exchange it must become a participant in the linkage plan  market makers a registration of market makers miax pearl members may register as market makers for the purpose of making markets in options contracts traded on the exchange market makers are entitled to receive certain benefits and privileges in exchange for fulfilling certain affirmative and negative marketmaking obligations to begin the process of registering as a market maker a member will be required to file a written application with miax pearl miax pearl will consider an applicants market making ability and other factors it deems appropriate in determining whether to approve an applicants registration all market makers will be designated as specialists on miax pearl for all purposes under the act and rules thereunder the exchange will not place any limit on the number of entities that may become market makers the good standing of a market maker may be suspended terminated or otherwise withdrawn if the conditions for approval cease to be maintained or the market maker violates any of its agreements with miax pearl or any provisions of the miax pearl rules a member that has qualified as a market maker may register to make markets in individual series of options the commission finds that the miax pearl qualification requirements are consistent with the act miax pearls rules provide an objective process by which a member could become a market maker on miax pearl the commission notes that miax pearls proposed market maker qualification requirements are similar to those of other options exchanges b market maker obligations pursuant to miax pearl rules there will be one class of market makers all market makers will be subject to a number of general obligations in particular the transactions of a market maker must constitute a course of dealings reasonably calculated to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market among other things a market maker must  start printed page maintain a twosided market during trading hours in a manner that enhances the depth liquidity and competitiveness of the market  engage in dealings for its own account when there is a lack of price continuity a temporary disparity between the supply of or demand for a particular option contract or a temporary distortion of the price relationships between option contracts of the same series  compete with other market makers  make markets that will be honored for the number of contracts entered  update quotations in response to changed market conditions and  maintain active markets market makers must provide continuous twosided quotes throughout the trading day  of the time in  of the series in which the market maker is registered further a market maker may be called upon by miax pearl to submit a single bid or offer or maintain continuous bid and offers in one or more series to which it is registered whenever in the judgment of the exchange it is necessary to do so in the interest of fair and orderly markets in addition market makers must maintain minimum net capital in accordance with the federal securities laws in options classes other than to which it is registered the total number of contracts executed during a quarter by a market maker in series in which it is not registered may not exceed  of the total number of all contracts executed by such market maker if miax pearl finds any failure by a market maker to properly perform as a market maker such market maker may be subject to suspension or termination of registration market makers will receive certain benefits in return for satisfying their responsibilities for example a brokerdealer or other lender may extend “good faith” credit to a member of a national securities exchange or registered brokerdealer to finance its activities as a market maker or specialist in addition market makers are excepted from the prohibition in section a of the act the commission believes that a market maker must be subject to sufficient and commensurate affirmative obligations including the obligation to hold itself out as willing to buy and sell options for its own account on a regular or continuous basis to justify favorable treatment the commission further believes that the rules of all us options markets need not provide the same standards for market maker participation so long as they impose affirmative obligations that are consistent with the act market makers on miax pearl will not receive special trading allocations or similar rights visàvis other members the commission believes that miax pearls market maker participation requirements impose sufficient affirmative obligations on miax pearls market makers and accordingly that miax pearls requirements are consistent with the act the commission believes that while market makers may become an important source of liquidity on miax pearl they will likely not be the only source as miax pearl is designed to match buying and selling interest of all miax pearl participants therefore the commission believes that miax pearls proposed structure is consistent with the exchange act  order display execution and priority miax pearl will operate a fully automated electronic options marketplace liquidity will be derived from orders to buy and orders to sell including orders from market makers submitted to miax pearl electronically by its members from remote locations there will be no physical trading floor options traded on the exchange will be subject to minimum price variations “mpv” that will begin at  for option contracts trading at less than  per option and  for option contracts trading at  per option or higher in addition miax pearl will participate in the penny pilot program pursuant to which it will permit certain options with premiums under  as well as heavily traded options on certain indices to be quoted and traded in increments as low as  orders submitted to miax pearl will be displayed unless the order is an immediately marketable order or is a contingent order such as an immediate or cancel order additionally orders may have a nondisplayed price that is different than the displayed price as further described below displayed orders and quotes will be displayed on an anonymous basis at a specified price nondisplayed prices associated with orders will not be displayed to any participant members may submit the following types of orders market marketable limit cancelreplacement immediateorcancel intermarket sweep do not route day limit good til cancelled and postonly all of these order types are based on similar order types available on other options exchanges the commission believes that these order types are substantially similar to order types approved by the commission on other exchanges and thus raise no new regulatory issues after the opening trades will execute on miax pearl when a buy order and a sell order match one another on the miax pearl order book “miax pearl book” or “book” the miax pearl system will continuously and automatically match orders pursuant to pricetime priority the highest bid start printed page and lowest offer shall have priority on the exchange within each price level if there are two or more orders at the best price trading interest will be executed in time priority miax pearl proposes to make available order processing and matching features which are based on those features available on miax exchange miax pearls system will automatically execute incoming orders that are executable against orders in its system provided that such incoming orders will not be executed at prices inferior to the nbbo miax pearl rule  sets forth how the miax pearl system will handle incoming orders that cannot be executed in part or in full in particular miax pearl rule  specifies a “price protection process” a managed interest process and a post only process each discussed more fully below the miax pearl system offers a “price protection” process for all orders price protection prevents an order from being executed beyond the price designated in the orders price protection instructions “the price protection limit” the price protection limit is expressed in units of mpv away from the national best bid and offer “nbbo” at the time of the orders receipt or the miax pearl best bid and offer “pbbo” if the best bid or offer on away markets “abbo” is crossing the pbbo when triggered price protection will cancel an order or the remaining contracts of an order the miax pearl system will not execute such orders at prices inferior to the current nbbo the miax pearl price protection process is substantially similar to that adopted by miax exchange the commission believes that this price protection functionality can benefit all market participants the exchanges rules also provide for a “managed interest process” that would apply to nonroutable orders  that would either lock or cross the current opposite side nbbo where the pbbo is inferior to the nbbo the miax pearl system will not execute such orders at prices inferior to the current nbbo the managed order would be displayed at one mpv away from the current opposite side nbbo and placed on the miax pearl book at a price equal to the opposite side nbbo should the nbbo price change to an inferior price level the orders displayed price will continue to reprice so that it is displayed one mpv away from the new nbbo and the orders book price will continuously reprice to lock the new nbbo such repricing will continue until the managed order is fully executed reaches its limit price reaches its price protection limit or is cancelled during the managed interest process if the exchange receives a new order or quote on the opposite side of the market from the managed order that could be executed the miax pearl system will immediately execute the remaining contracts to the extent possible at the initiating orders current booked bid or offer price provided that it does not trade through the current nbbo the commission believes that the miax pearls managed interest process is consistent with the managed interest process that the commission approved for miax exchange with regard to the treatment of postonly orders under miax pearls managed interest process the commission believes that the rules are consistent with rules that have been adopted by other exchanges governing the execution of postonly orders miax pearl will have a process for the handling of certain postonly orders “pop process” the pop process will apply to postonly orders where the limit price of the postonly order locks or crosses the current opposite side pbbo where the pbbo is the nbbo ie locks or crosses an order on the miax pearl book the miax pearl system will display and book such postonly orders one mpv away from the current opposite side pbbo should the pbbo price change to an inferior price level the postonly orders book price and displayed price would continuously reprice to one mpv away from new pbbo until postonly order is fully executed reaches its limit price reaches its price protection limit or is cancelled under the pop process if the exchange receives a new order or quote on the opposite side of the market from the postonly order that could be executed the miax pearl system will immediately execute the remaining contracts to the extent possible at the postonly orders current booked bid or offer price provided that it does not trade through the current nbbo if the exchange receives a new postonly order on the opposite side of the market from a postonly order being managed under the pop process and the new postonly order locks or crosses the book price of the resting postonly order the exchange will book and display the new postonly order one mpv away from the current opposite side pbbo the pop process under miax pearls rules is substantially similar to the managed interest process described above for miax pearl and that the commission approved for the miax exchange the primary difference is that under the pop process postonly orders are booked and displayed at the same price—one mpv away from the current opposite side pbbo this aspect of the pop process is consistent with the treatment of postonly orders on other exchanges start printed page  the commission believes that miax pearls proposed display execution and priority rules discussed above in this section are consistent with the act in particular the commission finds that the proposed rules are consistent with section b of the act which among other things requires that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating transactions in securities to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest and to not permit unfair discrimination between customers issuers or dealers the commission also finds that the proposed rules are consistent with section b of the act which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the trading rules of miax pearl are substantially similar to the current trading rules of miax exchange and other exchanges as noted above which were filed with and approved by the commission or otherwise became effective pursuant to section b of the act therefore the commission believes that these rules raise no new regulatory issues and are consistent with the act  section a of the act section a of the act  prohibits a member of a national securities exchange from effecting transactions on that exchange for its own account the account of an associated person or an account over which it or its associated person exercises investment discretion collectively “covered accounts” unless an exception applies the exchange has represented that it has analyzed its rules proposed hereunder and believes that they are consistent with section a of the act and rules thereunder for the reasons set forth below based on miax pearls representations the commission believes that miax pearls order execution algorithm will allow members to meet the requirements of rule at for executions on miax pearl rule at under the act known as the “effect versus execute” rule provides exchange members with an exemption from the section a prohibition rule at permits an exchange member subject to certain conditions to effect transactions for covered accounts by arranging for an unaffiliated member to execute the transactions on the exchange to comply with rule ats conditions a member i may not be associated with the executing member ii must transmit the order from off the exchange floor iii may not participate in the execution of the transaction once it has been transmitted to the member performing the execution  and iv with respect to an account over which the member or an associated person has investment discretion neither the member nor its associated person may retain any compensation in connection with effecting the transaction except as provided in the rule in a letter to the commission miax pearl requested that the commission concur with its conclusion that miax pearl members that enter orders into the miax pearl trading system satisfy the requirements of rule at for the reasons set forth below the commission believes that miax pearl members entering orders into the miax pearl trading system will satisfy the conditions of rule at first rule at requires that orders for covered accounts be transmitted from off the exchange floor miax pearl will not have a physical trading floor and like other automated systems the miax pearl trading system will receive orders from members electronically through remote terminals or computertocomputer interfaces in the context of other automated trading systems the commission has found that the offfloor transmission requirement is met if a covered account order is transmitted from a remote location directly to an exchanges floor by electronic means since the miax pearl trading system receives all orders electronically through remote terminals or computertocomputer interfaces the commission believes that the miax pearl trading system satisfies the offfloor transmission requirement second rule at requires that the member not participate in the execution of its order once it has been transmitted to the member performing the execution miax pearl has represented that the miax pearl trading system will at no time following the submission of an order allow a member or an associated person of such member to acquire control or influence over the result or timing of an orders execution according to miax pearl the execution of a members order is determined solely by what orders bids or offers are present in the miax pearl trading system at the time the member submits the order and the order priority based on miax pearl rules accordingly the commission believes that a miax pearl member will not participate in the execution of its order submitted into the trading system rule ats third condition is that the order be executed by an start printed page exchange member who is unaffiliated with the member initiating the order the commission has stated that the requirement is satisfied when automated exchange facilities such as the miax pearl trading system are used as long as the design of these systems ensures that members do not possess any special or unique trading advantages over nonmembers in handling their orders after transmitting them to the exchange miax pearl has represented that the design of its trading system ensures that no member has any special or unique trading advantage over nonmembers in the handling of its orders after transmitting its orders to miax pearl based on miax pearls representation the commission believes that the miax pearl trading system satisfies this requirement fourth in the case of a transaction effected for an account with respect to which the initiating member or an associated person thereof exercises investment discretion neither the initiating member nor any associated person thereof may retain any compensation in connection with effecting the transaction unless the person authorized to transact business for the account has expressly provided otherwise by written contract referring to section a of the act and rule at miax pearl members trading for covered accounts over which they exercise investment discretion must comply with this condition in order to rely on the rules exemption d discipline and oversight of members as noted above one prerequisite for the commissions grant of an exchanges application for registration is that a proposed exchange must be so organized and have the capacity to be able to carry out the purposes of the act specifically an exchange must be able to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange miax pearls rules codify miax pearls disciplinary jurisdiction over its members thereby facilitating its ability to enforce its members compliance with its rules and the federal securities laws miax pearls rules permit it to sanction members for violations of its rules and violations of any provision of the exchange act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by among other things expelling or suspending members limiting members activities functions or operations fining or censuring members suspending or barring a person from being associated with a member or any other fitting sanction in accordance with miax rules miax pearls disciplinary and oversight functions will be administered in accordance with chapter x of the miax pearl rules which governs disciplinary actions unless delegated to another sro pursuant to the terms of any effective d plan miax pearl regulatory staff including regulatory staff of another sro that may be acting on miax pearls behalf pursuant to a regulatory services agreement will among other things investigate potential securities laws violations and initiate charges pursuant to miax pearl rules upon a finding of probable cause of a violation within the disciplinary jurisdiction of miax pearl and where further proceedings are warranted miax pearl will conduct a hearing on disciplinary matters before a professional hearing officer  and two members of the business conduct committee  the “panel” the miax pearl member or their associated person or the miax pearl regulatory staff may petition for review of the decision of the panel by the miax pearl board any review would be conducted by the miax pearl board or a committee thereof composed of at least three directors of the miax pearl board  whose decision must be ratified by the miax pearl board and such decision will be final in addition the miax pearl board on its own motion may order review of a disciplinary decision appeals from any determination that impacts access to miax pearl such as termination or suspension of membership will be instituted under and governed by the provisions in the chapter xi of the miax pearl rules which incorporates by reference chapter xi of the miax exchange rules miax pearls chapter xi applies to persons economically aggrieved by any of the following actions of miax

such action has been taken applications for hearing and review will be referred to the business conduct committee which will appoint a hearing panel of no less than three members of such committee the decision of the hearing panel made pursuant to chapter xi of the miax pearl rules is subject to review by the miax pearl board either on its own motion within  days after issuance of the decision or upon written request submitted by the applicant or the president of miax pearl within  days after issuance of the decision the review would be conducted by the miax pearl board or a committee of the miax pearl board composed of at least three directors the commission finds that miax pearls proposed disciplinary and oversight rules and structure as well as its proposed process for persons economically aggrieved by certain miax pearl actions are consistent with the requirements of sections b and b of the act  in that they provide fair procedures for the disciplining of members and persons associated with members the commission further finds that the proposed miax pearl rules are designed to provide miax pearl with the ability to comply and with the authority to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the act the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of miax pearl the commission notes that miax pearls proposed disciplinary and oversight rules and structures are similar to the rules of other exchanges e listing requirements miax pearl does not intend to initially list or trade common stock or nonoption securities of operating companies but rather intends to initially only trade option contracts that meet the options listing standards of the exchange the commission finds that miax pearls proposed initial and continued listing rules are consistent with the act including section b in that they are designed to protect investors and the public interest prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and promote just and equitable principles of trade before beginning operation miax pearl will need to become a participant in the plan for the purpose of developing and implementing procedures designed to facilitate the listing and trading of standardized options submitted pursuant to section aab of the securities exchange act of  “olpp” in addition before beginning operation miax pearl will need to become a participant in the options clearing corporation iv exemption from section b of the act with regard to miax exchange cboe new york stock exchange “nyse” and finra rules incorporated by reference miax pearl proposes to incorporate by reference certain miax exchange cboe nyse and finra rules thus for certain miax pearl rules miax pearl members will comply with a miax

requests pursuant to rule  under the act an exemption under section  of the act from the rule filing requirements of section b of the act for changes to the miax pearl rules that are effected solely by virtue of a change to a crossreferenced miax exchange cboe nyse or finra rule miax pearl proposes to incorporate by reference categories of rules rather than individual rules within a category that are not trading rules in addition miax pearl agrees to provide written notice to its members whenever miax exchange cboe nyse or finra proposes a change to a crossreferenced rule  and whenever any such proposed changes are approved by the commission or otherwise become effective using the authority under section  of the act the commission previously exempted certain sros from the requirement to

and quoting interest on the exchange the tom data feed includes data that is identical to the data sent to the processor for the options price reporting authority “opra” the tom and opra data leave the miax pearl system  at the same time as required under section ciiib of the limited liability company agreement of the options price reporting authority llc the “opra plan” which prohibits the dissemination of proprietary information on any more timely basis than the same information is furnished to the opra system for inclusion in opras consolidated dissemination of options information tom

of each order or change in status to any order resting on the book eg routing trading or cancelling of the order plf will provide subscribers with specific order book data that should enhance their ability to analyze market conditions and to create and test trading models and analytical strategies the exchange believes the plf is a valuable tool that subscribers can use to gain comprehensive insight into the limit order book in a particular option the proposed data products provide valuable information that can help subscribers make informed investment decisions and operate in the same manner as similar data products offered by the miami international securities exchange llc “miax options” namely the miax options top of market data product “miax tom”  and the miax options order feed data product “mor” each of these proposed data products is available to members and nonmembers and to both professional and nonprofessional subscribers the exchange represents that it will make tom and plf equally available to any market participant that wishes to subscribe to it the exchange will establish monthly fees for the tom data product and the plf data product by way of separate proposed rule changes which the exchange will submit after the tom and plf products are established  statutory basis miax pearl believes that its proposed rule change is consistent with section b of the act  in general and furthers the objectives of section b of the act  in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest the tom market data product is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade by providing all subscribers with top of market data that includes the exchanges best bid and offer with aggregate size and last sale information based on order and quoting interest on the exchange that should enable them to make informed decisions on trading on miax pearl by using the tom data to assess current market conditions that directly affect such decisions the plf market data product is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade by providing all subscribers with limit order book data that should enable them to make informed decisions on trading miax pearl options by using the plf data to assess current market conditions that directly affect such decisions the proposed tom and plf market data products facilitate transactions in securities remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system by enhancing the subscribers ability to make decisions on trading strategy and by providing data which should help bring about such decisions in a timely manner to the protection of investors and the public interest the market data provided by both tom and plf removes impediments to and is designed to further perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system by making the miax pearl market more transparent and accessible to market participants making routing decisions concerning their options orders the exchange notes that the data provided on each of these data products are similar to and provide the same data as provided by data products of miax options with respect to options traded on that exchange the exchange believes that it is in the public interest to make similar information available with respect to options traded on miax pearl the proposed tom and plf market data products are also designated to protect investors and the public interest by providing data to subscribers that is already currently available on other start printed page competing exchanges which are similar to miax pearl  and will enable miax pearl to compete with such other exchanges thereby offering market participants with additional data in order to seek the market center with the best price and the most liquidity on which to execute their transactions all to the benefit of investors and the public interest and to the marketplace as a whole b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act on the contrary the exchange believes that the new market data products will enhance competition in the us options markets by providing users of miax pearl market data products that are similar to that which are currently provided on other competing options exchanges c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others written comments were neither solicited nor received iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action because the foregoing proposed rule change does not i significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest ii impose any significant burden on competition and iii become operative for  days after the date of the filing or such shorter time as the commission may designate it has become effective pursuant to ba of the act  and rule bf  thereunder the exchange has asked the commission to waive the day operative delay so that the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing the exchange has noted that waiving the operative delay would enable the exchange to make the tom and plf market data products available to subscribers at the time of the launch of trading on the exchange which is scheduled for february   the exchange has further argued that this would enable the exchange to better compete with other exchanges by offering market participants additional data in order to seek the market center with the best prices and the most liquidity on which to execute their transactions the commission believes that waiving the day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because such waiver will enable the exchange to begin offering these data products at the time of the launch of trading on the exchange in addition as noted by the exchange the proposal is consistent with the rules of other selfregulatory organizations previously approved by the commission for these reasons the commission designates the proposed rule change as operative upon filing at any time within  days of the filing of the proposed rule change the commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of
