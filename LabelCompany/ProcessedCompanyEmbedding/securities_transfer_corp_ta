themselves or someone acting on their behalf eg under a will this section of our website provides more information about the various types of transfers and documents required to transfer shares investor assistance why is it complicated to transfer securities transferring securities can be complex however our website provides comprehensive information and direction on the steps needed to transfer securities there are three main factors to consider value of the security — there is usually no limit to the potential value of a security therefore securities with a nominal value at the time of transfer can substantially increase in value over time relationship with the investor — the issuer and transfer agent have no longterm relationship with the person requesting the transfer as a result they need a way to confirm quickly that they are dealing with the appropriate person to protect themselves against a later challenge of the transfer strict requirements — securities transfer laws and established industry practices contain protections for people buying securities which must be offset by strict transfer requirements consequently specific practices and documents unique to transferring securities have been developed and are used by all transfer agents in particular you should note the requirement for signature guarantees on all transfers canadian stock transfer agents cannot process transfers without signature guarantees investor assistance what types of transfers are covered on this website our website provides information about four types of transfers under canadian law basic transfers — transfers of securities from one or more individuals to one or more other individuals or entities estate transfers — transfers of securities belonging to a person who is deceased corporate transfers — transfers of securities held in the name of a corporation trust transfers — transfers of securities held in the name of trustees consequently specific practices and
