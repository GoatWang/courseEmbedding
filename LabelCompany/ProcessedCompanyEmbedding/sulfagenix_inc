issuance of a key patent tweet   am cleveland ohio january  —sulfagenix inc wwwsulfagenixinccom is pleased to announce the issuance of a key patent related to its efforts to develop hydrogen sulfide prodrugs the clevelandbased pharmaceutical company is focused on developing medical foods drugs and therapies that address unmet medical needs by modifying existing molecules to improve safety bioavailability and efficacy us patent no  provides for compositions of sulfur molecules that can be used to treat disease caused by oxidative stress “through our work and the work of others we know that hydrogen sulfide therapy is very effective at preventing and treating cardiovascular disease in a variety of animal models” says dr john elrod assistant professor at temple school of medicine and a cofounder of sulfagenix “we now also know that sulfur plays an important role in numerous other diseases associated with oxidative stress including cancer and diabetes” the products covered in the patent were developed by mexican company nuevas alternativas naturales thermafat sa de cv nant the patent portfolio relating to these products including this issued application was licensed exclusively to sulfagenix for use in all fields the inventor of these new compositions mr gabriel gojon jr nant coo and sulfagenix cofounder adds “due to their increased bioavailability these new compositions can provide a safe and efficacious means of increasing circulating hydrogen sulfide levels and with this the opportunity to treat numerous diseases” additional patent applications covering many other aspects of sulfagenix’s platform are pending in the us and abroad sulfagenix is undertaking an initial development strategy of demonstrating the ability of its lead product sg administered orally as a medical food to overcome the nutritional deficiencies associated with lack of dietary sulfur initially for heart failure patients with congestive heart failure have been shown to be deficient for circulating levels of hydrogen sulfide and sulfagenix believes that sg will provide a safe and effective means of increasing these circulating levels sulfagenix is also developing additional products covered by these and pending applications for use in treating diseases associated with oxidative stress about sulfagenix inc sulfagenix is a privatelyheld biotechnology corporation based in cleveland ohio and built on decades of research on modifying existing molecules to improve safety bioavailability and efficacy for new uses the company’s first product in development sg is a precursor to a naturaloccurring molecule hydrogen sulfide for which deficits have been shown to exist in a number of serious diseases including cvd type ii diabetes cancer hypertension alzheimer’s disease cirrhosis hyperhomocysteinemia chronic kidney disease gi tract irritation asthma and wound healing sulfagenix was formed by executives from nant and scientists in the us to pursue development of these novel molecules as medical foods and therapeutics sulfagenix is currently raising series a financing to support theses activities and expects to begin development work early this year for

his career in biotech dr giordano was a senior scientist at abbott laboratories i think this is a phenomenal product that is going to be safe has utility in many diseases and has a very rapid path to the marketplace that will benefit many people and provide an excellent return on investment  tony giordano sulfagenix inc  cedar rd chesterland oh   wwwsulfagenixinccom       interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published  july     ceocfo mr giordano what is the concept and foundation of sulfagenix mr giordano we are based on work that was started in mexico in the early s with a father and son team dr gabriel gojon who is a phd chemist and his son gabriel a business person they started thinking about diseases and what was key to diseases they hypothesized that hydrogen sulfide is very important in diseases way back in the early s so dr gojon and his son started working on compounds molecules and formulations that could improve hydrogen sulfide levels they went through a number of reiterations before they came up with our product sg which through a single synthesis gives rise to a couple products that are all natural products but by synthesizing them together they dramatically increase the bioavailability of sulfur they then contacted a very well known cardiovascular researcher in the united states dr david lefer who was at emory at the time they sent him some of their product to test in his animal models of heart disease the product worked beautifully and david called me up we were working together on another company called theravasc and he called me and said i had to see this he had tested many products for major drug companies and heart failure and this is one of the best he had ever seen david introduced us and we started talking about how to develop this product from there we started sulfagenix and started the development of sg   ceocfo what specific condition is it addressing and what is the science mr giordano in many diseases there is oxidative stress so there are free radicals that are formed in the body that causes damage to cells what this does is prevents oxidative stress prevents inflammation and it stimulates endothelial cell function these are the cells of the blood vessels and heart so it is improving function and reducing stress on the blood vessels and heart for these reasons we are developing this for heart failure   ceocfo how does it do so what is happening when this drug gets into the cell mr giordano it is doing two things predominantly it is eliminating the free radicals so it is eliminating all the damaging agents and then the second thing it is doing is stimulating the production of nitric oxide nitric oxide is the molecule that has the profound effects on endothelial cell function   ceocfo how and when would this be used mr giordano we believe it is going to be used on a daily basis the product itself is very safe and actually there is another really important aspect all of us have circulating hydrogen sulfide in our bodies in our blood we have hydrogen sulfide but with heart failure patients they have a lower level of hydrogen sulfide than nonheart failure patients it is a normal substance that you could find in food but unfortunately you do not get enough from food hydrogen sulfide sulfur is plentiful in garlic but you would have to eat thousands of cloves of garlic to get what sg provides what we are doing is giving something that will boost your normal levels of hydrogen sulfide and remember in heart failure patients these are low sg boosts these levels back up to normal it is going to help the function of the heart and reduce the damaging molecules that are there that could cause problems with the heart we think that once a patient is diagnosed with heart failure they should start taking sg because of its safety profile and because all we are doing is providing what the patient does not have we believe that they should stay on the product for the rest of their lives   ceocfo is the medical community in agreement mr giordano it is a very new field i just returned from japan where they had the third international hydrogen sulfide conference it is still very early in fact sulfagenix gave the only presentation of clinical data at the conference no other investigator is even in clinic yet we believe that this is a really crucial pathway that is starting to gain recognition the number of articles being published are going up significantly each year and i think you are starting to see more acceptance by the scientific community of the role of hydrogen sulfide in diseases   ceocfo where is sulfagenix in the process mr giordano right now we are in the middle of a double blind placebo controlled phase one study in australia we are treating eight normal subjects and then following that with eight heart failure patients we are doing a dose escalation study the eight normal subjects have completed the trial we see no real safety issues and with the dose finding study we see very nice increases of hydrogen sulfide levels in the normal patients blood as i told you hydrogen sulfide should stimulate nitric oxide nitric oxide itself is very unstable when nitric oxide is made it readily picks up another oxygen and becomes nitrite what we also see in the blood is a significant rise in nitrite levels we are very encouraged with the data from the normal subjects in that we see safety increased hydrogen sulfide levels and one of the outcomes of hydrogen sulfide should be production of nitric oxide which we believe we have demonstrated by observing the increase in nitrite levels we are now in the middle of eight heart failure patients in australia we have three enrolled to date one of them has completed the threeweek study and two more are in the middle of testing we are screening others to get the last five enrolled in the study we hope to have that completed by the end of july   ceocfo is this a pill mr giordano this is a capsule   ceocfo what other conditions down the road might benefit mr giordano in mexico before we got involved a doctor friend of the gojons dr arturo morales tested this he runs an infertility clinic in mexico and he did a great deal of reading and found that one of the big problems with infertility is oxidative stress and damage to the sperm due to oxidative stress he started a double blind study where he looked at resveratrol which is one of the molecules from grapes that is supposed to be a very good antioxidant a placebo and sg this was sort of an investigator initiated trial he did  patients per group what he found was that resveratrol did nothing but sg had a significant increase in sperm concentration and a significant reduction in sperm abnormality he strongly believes because of the effects on oxidative damage that this would be very beneficial for male infertility along those same lines we have been talking to a pharmacologist in italy dr giuseppe cirino who is the director of the institute on sexual and reproductive medicine at university of napoli and he thinks that because of the nitric oxide stimulating activity this would also be a very good drug for treating erectile dysfunction we may be doing another trial in the future looking at this products effects on male infertility and sexual dysfunction i think that is one that is way up there on the list i was just at a conference in cleveland on nitric oxide which had some sessions on hydrogen sulfide and one of the leaders in the nitric oxide field dr sol snyder from johns hopkins gave a talk dr snyder pointed out that one of the key enzymes in hydrogen sulfide production is missing in huntingtons disease patients these patients may not be producing enough hydrogen sulfide so there is another opportunity that i think we should be exploring in the future   ceocfo are there any potential side effects to taking hydrogen sulfide mr giordano one of the things that we know nitric oxide does is that nitric oxide is a vessel dilator so it opens up blood vessels since hydrogen sulfide will stimulate nitric oxide you have the issue of opening up blood vessels vessel dilation can cause a drop in blood pressure and it could cause headaches and dizziness what we have found at least within our normal patients is that there was a very slow production of nitrite which means there is a slow production of nitric oxide and none of the patients complained of headaches or dizziness which you typically see if you produce a lot of nitric oxide at once nor did we see any real drop in blood pressure the hemodynamic effects that might be attributed to the nitric oxide piece of this were completely nonexistent so that was the big thing that we were looking at in dr morales trial in mexico and in our phase one trial the only complaint of these subjects was at the highest dose some of them complained of feeling a little nauseous   ceocfo what is your status as to funding mr giordano we are going to be looking for funding later this year we raised three million dollars from investors in mexico we have some very good business people in mexico who have invested in the company and that is allowing us to go through the phase one study and allowing us to get the product ready and actually get started on the phase two study which we hope to start later this year in australia we are developing this in a unique pathway as a medical food as opposed to a drug what that is going to allow us to do is get into the marketplace very quickly we expect that after the next study we will have the information we need to move this into the marketplace what we will be raising funds for later this year is to bring on a sales and marketing team we have already identified two very key people who we are bringing on both of them are senior vice presidents with companies today and one of them is big in the precommercialization area while the other is big in the implementation of sales and marketing the series b funding will allow us to bring those people on complete the phase two study and gear up for market and product launch in    ceocfo why market yourself why that decision as opposed to a third party mr giordano we believe that with the experience of these two individuals we will be able to do this the other aspect is that with the medical food we are going to be marketing direct to cardiologists and not necessarily to patients we may use a contract sales organization for sales function marketing direct to the cardiologist i think we will be able to generate and create enough of a market that we can support additional development   ceocfo what have you learned from past experiences that has been most helpful and continues to be in this particular situation mr giordano it is kind of unfortunate but it makes more sense to keep your cost low and keep things virtual as long as you can in some of my previous organizations we built out facilities we hired people and we built in many costs that were ongoing costs that we needed to support we were therefore constantly raising money in this operation we have kept things very lean we are outsourcing all of our activities so we can either speed things up or slow things down without a big drain on our capital resources   ceocfo put it together for our readers we reach many people in health care and we reach the investment community why sulfagenix mr giordano i think this is a phenomenal product that is going to be safe has utility in many diseases and has a very rapid path to the marketplace that will benefit many people and provide an excellent return on investment we have a key patent on producing hydrogen sulfide in the body so in our belief once we completely validate hydrogen sulfide as a drug target in humans people will need to come to us to practice in this area i think we are sitting in a nice position both with our product and with our ip   ceocfo final thoughts mr giordano the one thing i would like to mention is that we are doing all of our clinical studies in australia and i think australia is a phenomenal place right now to do business their regulatory path is very reasonable to get a product into clinical trials and they have a great refundable tax credit available for doing research and early stage development in australia i encourage people to really look at australia they have very high quality clinical sites cros and manufacturing organizations i am just really happy and excited about the work we are doing
