advanced degrees in soviet studies and asian studies and was a professor of international economics and finance for over  years prior to starting armada armada focuses on the market forces bearing down on organizations we provide a pipeline for intelligence that is focused on helping senior executives quickly navigate through complex market situations to assess risk and growth opportunities to that end we have developed a proprietary system of briefings for senior business leaders called the armada executive intelligence briefing system  it is comprised of  different types of intelligence briefings which collectively provide a complete view of the global macro marketplace for executives the briefings themselves are written in a manner that is direct and to the point and very similar in format to the daily written brief prepared for the president of the united states instituted in 9 for president kennedy the president’s daily brief pdb is a tool that the nation’s chief executive uses to understand the dynamics of the world they face arguably the briefings themselves are considered to be among the most top secret documents in the federal government our proprietary briefing system is patterned after the pdb – but designed for the business executive for use in understanding the  macro dynamics of the economy environment and the political decisions  events that will affect business decisions and add risk  if an event doesn’t have an impact on business we don’t write about it we also forecast where we think particular events are going – using a factbased scenario testing methodology we have developed executives tell us that they may not always like what we have to report but they always appreciate it our vision is to create a closelykept community of corporate executives from around the world sharing insights and intelligence on economics emerging  growth markets risks and other elements critical to running a corporation in an environment that is respectful professional and as confidential as a member wants it to be  we will start by priming the pump and downloading everything we know can collect and analyze about the global business environment in one of the ten different briefing elements  everything else is just valueadded benefits of being a member as an offshoot of this system we also prepare private briefings specifically for executives of corporations – focused on specific markets and elements of their business competition environment and other dimensions that they selfselect as being important to them designed as an “officer of the watch report” it is truly more like the pdb for a single executive than anything else on the market for more about the “officer of the watch report” click here get a  day risk free trial to the black

interesting please visit my contact page if you would like to send me an email and you may also leave comments on my blog at the end of each individual post let me tell you a little about myself i was born in northern new york although i now reside an hour depending on the traffic west of chicago i earned a ba in philosophy and a bmus in composition at suny potsdam an mm in composition as well as an mm in music history at bowling green state university and a phd in interdisciplinary arts at ohio university i’ve been writing seriously as a poet since high school learning my craft from my own efforts and the work of other poets my mentor was the late kay kasberger she would read my work and respond to it but she never said “this is good this is terrible” rather she would put a red asterisk by the things she liked and talk to me about why then she would leave me to revise study and write more this was also the time of simon and garfunkel whose work fascinated me by studying their lyrics i learned more about the craft of poetry—for that is truly what simon’s work is intelligent thoughtful wideranging rich truly poetry set to music kay encouraged me to study song lyrics since they appealed to me and i did by the time i got to college i was writing daily learning and practicing my craft this daily effort continues to this day prior to the middle of  i published some poems but not very often from the middle of  to the present i have been publishing on average one to two poems a month the content and form of my poetry are wideranging as are the journals that have taken them for a list of my publishing credits see my poetry page you can also read some samples of my published works to gain a sense of who i am as a writer finally although writing is my life my being…i have other interests as well i read widely poetry to literary fiction to history and philosophy take art classes dry media right now study hebrew and work out regularly i actually like it and some of what i encounter in the world around me finds its way into my work i think that’s probably true of every writer i hope you feel like you know me a little better now i certainly look forward to meeting you
