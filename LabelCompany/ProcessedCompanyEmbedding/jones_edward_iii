registered investment representatives irs that provide retail brokerage services throughout the united states canada and the united kingdom edward jones is the principal operating subsidiary of the jones financial companies lllp jones financial a missouri limited partnership whose limited partnership interests are registered under section g of the exchange act jones financial holds all of edward jones partnership equity jones financial is comprised of approximately  general partners  limited partners and  subordinated limited partners overview  edward jones is one of the largest sellers of brokeragesold mutual funds in the united states half of all of edward jones customers assets are invested in mutual funds held in brokerage accounts and college savings plans established under section  of the internal revenue code  plans edward jones customers hold onto their investments for a lengthier period of time than customers at other brokerdealers edward jones has selling agreements with approximately  mutual fund families which permit its irs to sell at least  different mutual funds  prior to the late s edward jones had internally designated certain of the mutual fund families with which it had selling agreements as recommended in the late s edward jones approached certain of those mutual fund families preferred families with which it had longstanding relationships and sought to obtain revenue sharing from them edward jones set an internal revenue sharing target of  of the advisory fees earned by those mutual fund families on the mutual fund assets purchased or held by edward jones customers plus in most instances sought an equity interest in their advisers or distributors the preferred mutual fund family program  by the early s six mutual fund families had agreed to make revenue sharing payments to edward jones between  and  edward jones removed one of these fund families and added two new fund families to the list of preferred families raising the total number of preferred families to seven  each of these fund families agreed to make revenue sharing payments to edward jones in varying amounts up to and in several cases meeting edward jones target of  of the advisory fees for assets purchased or held by edward jones customers these fees were calculated in various ways and by various measures including a flat fee determined by the fund family based on the total fund assets held by edward jones customers  to  basis points of average fund assets held by edward jones customers in a given year  basis points on the gross sales of a preferred families mutual funds made by edward jones to its customers in a given year or  of the advisory fee attributable to the average assets of certain preferred families mutual funds held by edward jones customers in a given year one of the preferred families also agreed to provide edward jones an equity interest of at least  in the distributor of its mutual funds if edward jones reached a certain threshold of sales of its mutual funds this was later changed to profit participation  revenue sharing was a material factor among others in the selection of at least two of the preferred families revenue sharing was also a material factor among others with respect to the retention of fund families as preferred families edward jones periodically sought to negotiate additional revenue sharing payments from its preferred families  edward jones revenue sharing agreements with the preferred families are and have been highly profitable to edward jones between  and the present the firm has collected tens of millions of dollars in revenue sharing payments from the preferred families each year most of these payments have been paid directly to edward jones from the assets of the advisers or distributors associated with the preferred families however for a portion of this time period edward jones also accepted millions of dollars in directed brokerage commissions or stepouts from three of the preferred families for distribution of mutual fund shares in these instances the advisers of these preferred families instructed the brokerage firm executing portfolio transactions for their mutual funds to step out of the transactions and direct a portion of the commissions for the transactions to edward jones these directed brokerage payments ceased in   edward jones distributed  to  of its net income which includes net revenue sharing to its limited partners and  to  of its net income to its subordinated limited partners each year and the residual is distributed to the general partners thus the majority of any revenue sharing received by edward jones after operating expenses was distributed to the firms general partners some of whom make decisions regarding which mutual fund families become preferred families and others of whom are edward jones irs who recommend the preferred families to their customers during  alone the revenue sharing received by edward jones was equivalent to  of the net income of edward jones parent holding company jones financial  out of the approximately  mutual fund families with which edward jones has selling agreements only the seven preferred families make revenue sharing payments to edward jones these payments are in addition to standard sales loads commissions rule b fees expense reimbursements and subtransferagent fees for maintaining customer account information edward jones does not receive any revenue sharing payments from any nonpreferred mutual fund families historically  to  of edward jones sales of mutual fund shares have been sales of the preferred families  edward jones and its partners have a financial incentive to internally promote the sales of mutual funds from the preferred families over other mutual funds that its irs can sell edward jones promoted to irs the existence of revenue sharing by the preferred families and encouraged irs on a casebycase basis to consider revenue sharing in making recommendations to their customers to purchase certain mutual funds  for example during the relevant time period edward jones director of mutual fund marketing described his greatest contribution to the firms bottom line as the departments ability to continue the focus on selling preferred fund families and the subsequent leverage this gives us to negotiate revenue sharing programs with vendors he also represented to the irs that edward jones directly passes the revenue sharing income along to the irs who did the work to get the money in the first place  during the rollouts of the two newest preferred families a general partner of the firm also made broadcast presentations to irs throughout the country further extolling the benefits the irs receive from the revenue sharing agreements negotiated with these preferred families  at least one newsletter distributed by an edward jones regional leader conveyed this message by describing how revenue sharing can contribute large benefits to the firm in terms of profit and bonus in a january  regional newsletter a regional leader further promoted the sales of mutual funds from preferred families that provide revenue sharing payments over those that do not provide revenue sharing by describing how over a ten year period an ir would receive an additional  in profit from the sales of such mutual funds during regional and other meetings another of edward jones regional leaders who was also a general partner encouraged irs in his region to sell the mutual funds of one preferred family over the funds of another preferred family that paid less revenue sharing  edward jones irs receive credits for the amount of revenue sharing that edward jones receives from the irs proportionate sales and customer holdings of funds from the preferred families these credits were not directly paid to irs but were applied as a separate line item to the profit and loss statements pls prepared for each irs office these pls are distributed monthly to the irs and track their profitability to the firm an irs profitability to the firm determines whether the ir is successful at edward jones and is used as a factor in determining whether the ir will be considered for status as a limited partner in addition three times per year edward jones irs are eligible to receive bonuses based in part on their overall profitability which is impacted by their revenue sharing credits for an ir to receive a bonus in any of edward jones three annual bonus periods both the firm and the particular irs office must be profitable during the period in addition if an ir has worked for edward jones for more than  months the ir also needs to make at least  in profits to become eligible for a bonus edward jones topproducing irs have received as much as an additional  per bonus period as the part of their bonuses based directly on revenue sharing payments attributable to the irs sales and customer holdings of funds from the preferred families to their retail customers  edward jones further offers diversification contest trips to its irs two times each year during these contests the irs can qualify for a trip by earning points based on among other things their sales of mutual funds once an ir earns a specific number of points the ir wins a trip although the irs generally can earn contest points for selling any mutual funds or other investment product for a ninetyday period in the fall of  edward jones only gave mutual fund contest points for the sale of a subset of mutual funds from the preferred families one or more of

funds from the preferred families  the mutual fund section of edward jones public website lists only the seven preferred families and provides links to only the preferred families websites in addition since approximately  edward jones has claimed on its public website that it focuses on the seven preferred families because with nearly  mutual funds available it can be difficult to know which funds to pick thats why at edward jones we focus on seven preferred mutual fund families that share our same commitment to service longterm investment objectives and longterm performance  during the same time period edward jones did not disclose on its website or in any other written document that it prepared the revenue sharing directed brokerage payments and other payments received from the

jones and its irs do not orally disclose to customers the revenue sharing directed brokerage or other payments received by edward jones in connection with the distribution of mutual fund shares or the

disclose revenue sharing arrangements at all relevant times edward jones required its irs to provide customers with a prospectus at the pointofsale or with the confirmation of sale of any mutual fund however the firm did not require its irs to provide and irs did not provide customers with copies of sais unless a customer specifically requested a copy  many of the preferred families prospectuses and sais fail to disclose adequate information about the source and the amount of the revenue sharing payments to edward jones and the dimensions of the resulting potential conflicts of interest although the preferred families prospectuses and sais contained various disclosures concerning payments to brokerdealers distributing their funds few of these disclosures adequately described edward jones potential conflict of interest  during the relevant time period edward jones also has not had sufficient procedures in place to ensure that someone with appropriate knowledge experience and authority reviews the prospectuses and sais of the mutual funds offered by the preferred families to determine if they adequately disclose revenue sharing and directed brokerage payments made to edward jones or the other incentives offered to edward jones by the preferred families edward jones  college savings plan sales and disclosures  since  edward jones has offered and sold  college
