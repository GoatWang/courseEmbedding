money while the other books in the series are an excellent family resource they skip swathes of chapters we bought it as a family and read from it for our family scripture reading we only noticed that they skipped entire chapters and give a frankly inaccurate summary of them templerelated chapters in exodus are completely overlooked its like the editors dont understand what the modern relevance is so they just leave it out and summarize what they think it means who gave them the right to say what is relevant to my family and what isnt weve reverted back to the kjv i want my money back outstanding bookby william submitted on i purchased my copy used in just like new condition at a bargain store for  it looks fantastic to me there are no duplicated pages and no missing pages to the best of my knowledge at least not the ones the one reviewer mentioned it is beautifully done and is great reading yes there are a lot of missing verses but what i see are the verses that we really need not all the genealogy stuff and other like verses that can put some people especially kids to sleep one can use the official kjv to get those verses that need no explanation very disappointedby ronald submitted on we have purchased every book in this series and have enjoyed each a great deal this has not been the case with the old testament for latterday saint families the parts and chapters that were there were excellent however the book summarizes so many chapters verses and in some cases whole books that it leaves you wondering why you purchased it i feel the authors and publishers should have made a vol  and vol  rather then take away from the plain and precious truths you are better off buying an old testament commentary and studing your own kjv old testament great bookby suzanne submitted on great book for understanding the old testament when studying with your family we had one problem pages  were duplicated and pages  were missing check your copy a wonderful

judgment as birks states in the preface the object of his text is to “remove some of those difficulties which have often haunted thoughtful and inquiring minds when they reflect on the deeper truths and more solemn aspects of religion both natural and revealed    the aim of these pages is not to awaken the sense of difficulties in the readers’ minds but to relieve the depth of these shadows where they have been felt in their chilling and depressing power in the hope that the views here partly unfolded and which are not hastily entertained may be to some weary spirits like a streak of morning light upon the distant mountains when the gloom of night is passing away they are committed to the blessing of the true fountain of all wisdom” contents on the knowledge of god on the power of god on

the “first elements” of the symbolical prophecies of daniel and john the prophecy of jesus and a few predictions in the writings of paul he states his object as being “to secure firm footing at every step and avoiding more doubtful questions to establish the first elements of prophetic truth on clear and logical grounds of scripture evidence and solid reason” he helps readers unpack these kinds of prophecies that “refer more immediately to the church of christ in its actual state and present dangers” and “endeavored to remove some of those prejudices and objections which have lately been repeated in various forms and have tended to obscure even the simplest conclusions that had been previously drawn from the inspired predictions” birks designs his work to serve as an introduction to works on these prophecies from writers such as mede daubauz cressener and faber contents arguments alleged against the received interpretations presumptions alleged for the futurist theories on the
