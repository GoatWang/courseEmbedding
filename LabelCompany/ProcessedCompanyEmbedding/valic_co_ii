proxy has been mailed to you so that you may vote on several proposals concerning your investment in the north american funds variable product series ii nafv ii although you are not directly a

other insurance company separate accounts belonging to valic affiliates you have the right to instruct valic how to vote fund shares that are attributable to your contract q what is being proposed a there are six proposals altogether as shown in the overview below quick overview of proposals proposal  to approve the new investment advisory agreement between the current investment adviser the variable annuity life insurance company valic and nafv ii with respect to each series of nafv ii affected funds all reason for the proposal a new agreement is being proposed due to the acquisition of american general corporation valics parent company by the american international group inc aig this is referred to in the proxy statement as the merger the merger was completed on august   and caused the old investment advisory agreement between valic and nafv ii to automatically expire due to the change in valics ownership proposal  to approve the new investment subadvisory agreement between valic and american general investment management lp agim as subadviser affected funds north americanag core bond fund north americanag high yield bond fund and north americanag strategic bond fund reason for proposal the merger brings opportunities for integration and consolidation of affiliates it has been determined that agim the current subadviser for the north americanag core bond fund north americanag high yield bond fund and north americanag strategic bond fund will consolidate operations with those of another affiliate aig global investment corp aiggic to eliminate duplication and attempt to create economies of scale within the organization this is addressed in proposal  the purpose of proposal  is to ensure that these three bond funds are subadvised during the time period from the date of the shareholder meeting december   through the date the aiggic subadvisory agreement would take effect if approved by shareholders january   federal law requires that the board of trustees and shareholders each approve the subadvisory agreement because it is with an affiliated subadviser proposal  to approve the new investment subadvisory agreement between valic and sunamerica asset management corp saamco as subadviser affected fund north americanag  money market fund reason for proposal the merger could result in personnel and functions being moved from one affiliate valic to another affiliate saamco saamco is a whollyowned subsidiary of sunamerica inc which is a whollyowned subsidiary of aig the north americanag  money market fund does not currently have a subadviser however when the portfolio management personnel and functions flow to saamco a subadvisory agreement will be necessary thus you are being asked to approve an investment subadvisory agreement for this affiliated company valic does not expect any change in the nature or quality of services provided as a result of these new investment subadvisory arrangements proposal  to approve the new investment subadvisory agreement between valic and aiggic as subadviser affected funds north americanag aggressive growth lifestyle fund north americanag conservative growth lifestyle fund north americanag core bond fund north americanag high yield bond fund north americanag moderate growth lifestyle fund north americanag socially responsible fund and north americanag strategic bond fund reason for proposal because of the consolidation of affiliates discussed above in the overview for proposal  several of the valic and agim personnel and functions will be moved to another affiliate aiggic to eliminate duplication and attempt to create economies of scale within the organization aiggic is owned by aig global investment group inc which in turn is a whollyowned subsidiary of aig valic does not expect any change in the nature or quality of services provided as a result of these new investment subadvisory arrangements proposal  to approve amended fundamental investment restrictions to a delete restrictions that are no longer required to be fundamental due to changes in laws or which otherwise need not be fundamental and b to standardize the language of those restrictions that are still required to be fundamental affected funds all reason for proposal many of the current fundamental investment restrictions are more restrictive than federal law fundamental in this context means that both the board of trustees and the fund shareholders must approve any changes to the restriction valic has recommended to the board that the investment restrictions of the funds be changed to conform to but not be more restrictive than federal law this would give each of the funds more flexibility however these changes if approved are not expected to affect the way in which the funds are managed or the securities or instruments in which the funds invest proposal  to elect the following as trustees robert p condon dr judith l craven william f devin dr timothy j ebner judge gustavo e gonzales

related as a result of the acquisition of american general corporation american general by american international group inc aig on august   the merger american general shareholders received  of a share of aig common stock in exchange for each share of american general common stock american general valic agim saamco and aiggic are affiliated companies as a result of the merger for more information about aig valic agim saamco and aiggic please see the information about    sections below the advisory and subadvisory agreements valic is an investment adviser registered with the securities and exchange commission sec it is engaged in the business of rendering investment advisory and management services to various investment companies nafv ii previously contracted with valic the previous advisory agreement to furnish these services to each of the funds and is paid an annual management fee based on each of the funds average daily net assets accordingly valic provides ongoing management supervision policy direction and legal services to the funds legal services include the preparation of registration statements prospectuses reports to shareholders proxy solicitation materials fund compliance services and recordkeeping the board including all of the trustees who are not interested persons of the investment company the independent trustees within the meaning of section a of the investment company act of  the  act most recently unanimously approved the continuance of the previous advisory agreement on july   for the earlier of a one year period or through the merger date the initial sole shareholder of the funds valic separate account a approved the previous advisory agreement on august   as investment adviser to nafv ii valic has overall responsibility for the general management and daytoday operations of the funds but may employ one or more investment subadvisers to make the investment decisions for a fund valic previously contracted with american general investment management lp agim an affiliate to manage the core bond fund high yield bond fund and strategic bond fund the previous subadvisory agreement the board including the independent trustees most recently unanimously approved the continuance of the previous subadvisory agreement on july   for the earlier of a one year period or through the merger�date the consummation of the merger constituted an assignment of the previous advisory and previous subadvisory agreements under the  act thus the previous advisory agreement and previous subadvisory agreement automatically terminated as of the merger affiliation with aigs asset management operations as a result of the merger valic and agim have become associated with aigs asset management operations which offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services including variable annuities mutual funds and investment asset management such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally aigs three principal asset management operations are saamcos asset management operations aig global investment group inc global investment and its subsidiaries and aig capital partners inc cap partners saamco develops and sells mutual funds and variable annuities and other investment products and provides financial services global investment manages thirdparty institutional retail and private equity fund assets on a global basis and provides custodial services cap partners organizes and manages the invested assets of institutional investment funds and may also invest in such funds each of these subsidiary operations receives fees for investment products and services provided this association also brings opportunities for integration and consolidation of affiliates agim will consolidate operations with those of another affiliate aiggic to eliminate duplication and attempt to create economies of scale within the organization thus valic recommended that the board approve the appointment of affiliated companies aiggic and saamco as subadvisers for the funds listed above in proposal  and  both board approval and shareholder approval are generally required whenever an investment company seeks to appoint an affiliate of the adviser as a subadviser the interim and new investment advisory and subadvisory agreements board considerations at meetings of the board held on july   the board including independent trustees unanimously approved an interim advisory agreement the interim advisory agreement between nafv ii on behalf of each fund and valic which became effective as of the merger the board also approved an interim subadvisory agreement between valic and agim for the core bond fund high yield bond fund and strategic bond fund the interim subadvisory agreement the terms of the interim subadvisory agreement are the same as those of the previous subadvisory agreement except for the effective date and term the interim advisory agreement and interim subadvisory agreement collectively the interim agreements were each approved by the board pursuant to rule a under the  act to ensure the uninterrupted receipt by the funds of investment advisory services during the period between the merger and the shareholder meeting this rule under certain circumstances allows interim advisory and subadvisory agreements to take effect and to remain in effect for up to  days without receiving prior shareholder approval as long as the fees payable under such agreement do not exceed the fees payable under the predecessor agreement that had been approved by the shareholders and certain other contractual provisions are included in the interim agreements the interim agreements require all fees earned to be escrowed pending shareholder approval of the new investment advisory agreement between nafv ii and valic the new advisory agreement if a new advisory agreement is not approved valic and agim will be entitled to receive from escrow the lesser of any costs incurred in performing their duties in the interim agreements plus interest earned on the amount while in escrow or the total amount in the escrow account plus interest earned the interim agreements will terminate on the earlier of the effective date of the new advisory or subadvisory agreements or  days after the merger pursuant to the terms of the interim advisory agreement valic is responsible for the management of the investment portfolio of each fund the provisions of the interim advisory agreement are the same as those of the previous advisory agreement except that the provision concerning administrative services was deleted from the interim advisory agreement and moved to be part of a separate administrative services agreement and with respect to the effective date the term and the escrow conditions relating to valics fees as described above under the  act valic may continue to serve as the investment adviser for a fund beyond an interim period of  days only if shareholders approve a new advisory agreement with valic consequently the board including all independent trustees unanimously approved and recommended shareholder approval of the new advisory agreement the new advisory agreement if approved by shareholders will take effect immediately upon such approval the terms of the new advisory agreement are the same in all material respects as those of the interim advisory agreement except for the effective date and the termination date in connection with its approval of the new advisory agreement the board considered that the merger did not involve any changes in the overall form of the advisory contract or any of the funds objectives or policies and observed that the fees remained the same as part of their deliberations the board took into account the following among other factors the nature and quality of the services provided or reasonably anticipated to be provided and the results achieved or reasonably anticipated to be achieved by valic the amount and structure of investment advisers fees generally and the fees payable under the new advisory agreement the financial strength of aig the management personnel and operations of aig the commitment of aig to the financial services industry and the terms of the merger the board also considered that the terms of the new advisory agreement are the same in all material respects as those of the interim advisory agreement and that the new advisory agreement is essentially a continuation of the previous advisory agreement except as discussed above the board including all of the independent trustees determined that the terms of the new advisory agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the new advisory agreement is necessary and in the best interests of nafv ii on behalf of each fund and its shareholders to ensure the continued receipt of the same quality of services as is currently provided the board then considered a new subadvisory agreement for agim the new agim subadvisory agreement for the core bond fund high yield bond fund and the strategic bond fund to cover the period from december  through december   the board reviewed information regarding the agim investment processes and the subadvisory fees for the core bond fund high yield bond fund and the strategic bond fund in connection with the new agim subadvisory agreement subsequently the board including all independent trustees unanimously approved and recommended shareholder approval of the new agim subadvisory agreement if approved by shareholders the new agim subadvisory agreement would take effect immediately upon such approval the terms of the new agim subadvisory agreement are the same in all material respects as those of the interim advisory agreement except for the effective date and termination date in connection with its approval of the new agim subadvisory agreement the board considered the following among other factors that any internal reorganization of agim would not result in a change in the personnel responsible for providing services to the core bond fund high yield bond fund and the strategic bond fund the nature and quality of the services provided or reasonably anticipated to be provided and the results achieved or reasonably anticipated to be achieved by agim and the amount and structure of the fees payable under the new agim subadvisory agreement the board including all of the independent trustees also considered the terms of the new agim subadvisory agreement and determined that the terms of the new agim subadvisory agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the new agim subadvisory agreement is necessary and in the best interests of nafv i on behalf of the core bond fund high yield bond fund and the strategic bond fund and each funds shareholders to ensure the continued receipt of the same quality of services as is currently provided at the board meeting of october  and   the board reviewed the recommendation from valic that saamco be appointed as the subadviser for the money market ii fund the board considered a new investment subadvisory agreement for saamco the saamco subadvisory agreement the terms of the saamco subadvisory agreement were based on the previous subadvisory agreement between valic and agim though with different entities and fees the board reviewed information regarding the investment processes of saamco and considered the historical performance it achieved in connection with a similar fund in connection with its approval of the saamco subadvisory agreement the board considered among other factors the nature and quality of the services provided or reasonably anticipated to be provided and the results achieved or reasonably anticipated to be achieved by saamco the amount and structure of investment subadvisory fees generally and the subadvisory fees payable under the saamco subadvisory agreement and the investment management experience of the personnel who would be managing the money market ii fund considering the terms of the saamco subadvisory agreement the board including all of the independent trustees determined that the terms of the saamco subadvisory agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of the saamco subadvisory agreement is necessary and in the best interests of nafv ii on behalf of the money market ii fund and its shareholders the board also considered a subadvisory agreement for aiggic the aiggic subadvisory agreement relating to valics recommendation that aiggic be appointed as the subadviser for the aggressive growth lifestyle fund conservative growth lifestyle fund core bond fund high yield bond fund moderate growth lifestyle fund socially responsible fund and strategic bond fund previously these funds did not have a subadviser except for core bond fund high yield bond fund and strategic bond fund which were subadvised by agim valic recommended that additional funds be subadvised by aiggic because internal reorganizations due to the merger could result in personnel being moved from one affiliated company to another affiliated company however there would be no change in the nature or quality of services provided the board reviewed information regarding the aiggic investment processes and the subadvisory fees for each affected fund in connection with the aiggic subadvisory agreement subsequently the board including all independent trustees unanimously approved and recommended shareholder approval of the aiggic subadvisory agreement if approved by shareholders the aiggic subadvisory agreement will take effect on or about january   the terms of the aiggic subadvisory agreement are substantially similar to those of the interim subadvisory agreement except for the effective date and term and the addition of funds as discussed above the aiggic subadvisory agreement fees for the

provided and the results reasonably anticipated to be achieved by aiggic the amount and structure of the fees payable under the aiggic subadvisory agreement and the investment management experience of the personnel who would be managing the affected funds the board including all of the independent trustees also considered the terms of the aiggic subadvisory agreement and determined that the terms

director ernest t patrikis director brokerage selection practices  valic agim saamco and aiggic valic and its affiliates agim saamco and aiggic have provided information about each firms brokerage selection practices including soft dollars directed brokerage and transactions with affiliated brokers these are important practices to evaluate when deciding to hire or continue a contract with an adviser and are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws valic reviews these practices and will also evaluate any conflicts of interest inherent in the advisers policies and practices soft dollars the term soft dollars is often used to describe that part of the basic trade commission which exceeds the lowest rate available from other brokerdealers and which is used by the adviser to obtain research and other services from brokerdealers soft dollars have not been used to offset expenses of any of the funds directed brokerage a directed brokerage agreement is another form of a soft dollar arrangement and includes those arrangements under which products or services other than execution of securities transactions expense reimbursements or commissions are recaptured for a client from or through a brokerdealer in exchange for directing the clients brokerage transactions to that brokerdealer the board has determined that a directed brokerage arrangement with state street brokerage lynch jones and ryan andor any other comparable brokerdealer is in the best interest of each fund and its shareholders and therefore has conveyed the information to subadvisers a fund may participate in directed brokerage arrangements consistent with the requirements of best execution subject to a limit of  of a funds eligible commissions thus a fund may benefit from the products or services or recaptured commissions obtained through the directed brokerage arrangement although there may be other transaction costs greater spreads or less favorable net prices on transactions as long as the trader executing the transaction for a fund indicates that this is a directed brokerage transaction the fund will get a percentage of commissions paid on either domestic trades or international trades credited back to the fund these credits are in hard dollars and could be used to offset the funds custody expenses or to pay other fund expenses excluding expenses payable to affiliates by entering into a brokerageservice arrangement a fund can reduce expenses reported to shareholders in its statement of operations fee table and expense ratio and can increase its reported yield any such transactions will be disclosed in the registration statement for the funds transactions with affiliated brokers valic and its affiliates do not typically participate in transactions with affiliated brokers there is no affiliation between valic or any person affiliated with valic nafv i or the funds and any brokerdealer that may execute a transaction for the funds � � proposal  all funds to approve amended fundamental investment restrictions to a delete restrictions that are no longer required to be fundamental due to changes in laws or which otherwise need not be fundamental and b to standardize the language of those restrictions that are still required to be fundamental discussion each fund invests its assets in accordance with its investment objective strategies and investment restrictions investment restrictions are designated as fundamental or nonfundamental anything designated as fundamental such as the fundamental investment restrictions can only be changed with approval from the board and fund shareholders by contrast anything designated as nonfundamental may be changed upon board approval each funds investment objective and strategies and the nonfundamental investment restrictions have been designated as nonfundamental policies and therefore may be changed without shareholder approval fund policies and whether they are fundamental or nonfundamental are designated as such when the fund is created generally the policies are reflective of the laws or styles of the time some of the funds fundamental investment restrictions that are not required to be fundamental under the  act were adopted in the past to reflect certain regulatory business or industry conditions which are no longer in effect further federal and state laws governing mutual funds have been changed numerous times in the last several years the nafv ii prospectus and statement of additional information sai now contain fundamental investment restrictions that are more restrictive than the current law this can restrict a funds investments and could potentially impair its performance no fund intends to change its investment style or the securities or instruments in which it may invest as explained above federal law in many cases controls what a mutual fund can purchase federal law also specifies which investment policies or restrictions must be fundamental the policies that are required by law to be fundamental are those concerning fund diversification borrowing money the issuance of senior securities underwriting of securities issued by other persons the purchase and sale of real estate and commodities the policy about making loans to other persons and the concentration of investments in a particular industry or group of industries borrowing under the funds current fundamental restrictions most of the funds may borrow only under certain circumstances such as for temporary or emergency purposes the proposed restriction would permit each fund to engage in borrowing in a manner and to the full extent permitted under the  act any rule regulation or order under the  act or any sec staff interpretation of the  act the  act generally permits the funds to borrow money under the following circumstances  a fund may borrow an amount equal to or less than   of its total assets including the amount borrowed from banks or  a fund may borrow an amount equal to or less than  of its total assets for temporary or emergency purposes from any person commodities a commodity is food metal or another physical substance that investors buy or sell usually via futures contracts normally a fund will not purchase or sell physical commodities but may acquire physical commodities as a result of the funds ownership of securities or other instruments a fund may also choose to purchase or sell securities or other instruments backed by physical commodities or options and futures contracts if it is in accordance with its investment strategy and is allowed by the investment restrictions the current fundamental investment restrictions are more restrictive than federal law the purpose of the standardized restriction is to clarify and standardize this investment policy concentration the funds are prohibited from concentrating investments in one industry for most of the funds this means that the fund cannot invest more than  of total assets in the securities of companies engaged primarily in any one industry other than the us government its agencies and instrumentalities this is more restrictive than current federal law which does not specify a percentage limitation for this restriction diversification each fund is required to state whether it will have a diversified portfolio or a nondiversified portfolio all of the funds in nafv ii are diversified a fund that is diversified under the  act must invest in several different companies and adhere to the federal diversification rule the diversification rule states that at least  of the value of total assets the diversified portion must be represented by cash and cash items including receivables us government securities securities of other investment companies and other securities this is further limited in that with respect to the diversified portion of a funds assets a fund may not have an amount greater in value than  of the value of total assets invested in any one issuer and not more than  of the outstanding voting securities of an issuer currently for several of the funds the current diversification policy statement applies the  and  limitations to  of the value of the total assets of each fund which is more restrictive than the law issuance of senior securities under the  act and the funds fundamental restriction stated below the funds are restricted from issuing senior securities with certain exceptions a senior security is an obligation of a fund with respect to its earnings or assets that takes precedence over the claims of the funds shareholders with respect to the same earnings or assets the  act generally prohibits a fund from issuing senior securities in order to limit the use of leverage in general a fund uses leverage when it enters into securities transactions without being required to make payment until a later time current sec staff interpretations regarding the  act allow a fund to engage in a number of types of transactions which might otherwise be considered creating senior securities or leverage so long as the fund meets certain segregation requirements designed to protect shareholders in order to ensure that the funds restrictions with respect to issuing senior securities are consistent with the provisions of the  act it is proposed that the restriction on issuing senior securities be revised to state that the funds may not issue senior securities except to the extent permitted under the  act any rule regulation or order under the  act or any sec staff interpretation of the  act if the proposed change is adopted the following activities will not be considered to be issuing senior securities with respect to the funds i collateral arrangements in connection with any type of option future contract forward contract or swap ii collateral arrangements in connection with initial and variation margin or iii a pledge mortgage or hypothecation of a funds assets to secure its borrowings loans funds may not loan cash generally but may occasionally choose to lend portfolio securities or make other lending arrangements as permitted by law or exemptive relief such as interfund lending during the period of such a loan the fund typically receives the income on both the loaned securities and the loan collateral or a flat fee thereby increasing the portfolio yield the primary purpose of this standardized restriction is to expand the current exceptions to the fundamental investment restriction to include lending arrangements permitted by the  act any rule regulation or order under the  act or any sec staff interpretation of the  act real estate funds generally do not purchase real estate due to its illiquidity but may want to invest in a security that is backed by real estate or interests in real estate the purpose of this proposed standardized investment restriction is to clarify what can be purchased underwriting each fund is currently prohibited from underwriting securities of other issuers an underwriter brings securities to the market through a selling or distribution agreement a selling agreement allows the underwriter to buy the securities from a company and then resell the securities to investors it is proposed that the fundamental restriction be clarified to allow the funds to underwrite securities to the extent that the fund may be deemed to be an underwriter under certain federal securities laws the current fundamental investment restrictions for the funds excerpted from the sai are shown in appendix  the standardized fundamental investment restrictions proposed for shareholder approval are shown below proposed standardized fundamental investment restrictions borrowing all funds each fund may borrow money in amounts up to   of the value of its total assets for temporary or emergency purposes or as permitted by law each fund may also borrow money for investment purposes up to the maximum extent permissible under the  act a fund may also obtain such shortterm credits as may be necessary for the clearance of purchases and sales of portfolio securities in order to secure any permitted borrowings and reverse repurchase agreements under this section a fund may pledge mortgage or hypothecate its assets this policy shall not prohibit a fund from engaging in reverse repurchase agreements dollar rolls or similar investment strategies described in the prospectus and the statement of additional information as amended from time to time commodities all funds no fund may purchase or sell physical commodities except that each fund may i hold and sell physical commodities acquired as a result of the funds ownership of securities or other instruments ii purchase or sell securities or other instruments backed by physical commodities or iii purchase or sell commodity options and futures contracts in accordance with its nonfundamental or operating policies concentration all funds each fund may not concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers primarily engaged in any particular industry other than securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements secured thereby or domestic bank money market instruments diversification all funds each fund may not make any investment inconsistent with its classification as a diversified investment company under the  act issuance of senior securities all funds no fund may issue senior securities except as permitted by the  act any rule regulation or order under the  act or any sec staff interpretation of the  act lending all funds no fund may make loans except that each fund may in accordance with its nonfundamental or operating policies i engage in repurchase agreements ii lend portfolio securities iii purchase debt securities iv purchase commercial paper and v enter into any other lending arrangement including interfund lending as permitted by the  act any rule regulation or order under the  act by exemptive relief or by any sec staff interpretation of the  act real estate all funds no fund may purchase or sell real estate except that each fund may i hold and sell real estate acquired as a result of the funds ownership of securities or other instruments ii purchase or sell securities or other instruments backed by real estate or interests in real estate and iii purchase or sell securities of entities or investment vehicles including real estate investment trusts that invest deal or otherwise engage in the business of real estate underwriting all funds no fund may underwrite the securities of other issuers except as permitted by the board within applicable law and except to the extent that in connection with the sale or disposition of its portfolio securities a fund may be deemed to be an underwriter valic has recommended to the board that the investment restrictions of the funds be changed to conform to but not be more restrictive than the federal law valic believes that the proposed standardization of the fundamental investment restrictions will give it the flexibility to respond to future changes in the regulatory or investment environment without incurring the costs and delay associated with a shareholder vote adoption of the standardized fundamental investment restrictions is not expected to affect the way in which the funds are managed or the securities or instruments in which the funds invest after careful consideration and with the advice of outside counsel the board has approved the standardization of the fundamental investment restrictions subject to shareholder approval by reducing to a minimum those policies that can be changed only with a shareholder vote the board believes that valic would be able to minimize the costs and delay associated with holding future shareholder meetings to revise fundamental policies that become outdated or inappropriate although the proposed changes in fundamental restrictions will allow the portfolio managers greater investment flexibility to respond to future investment opportunities the board does not anticipate that the changes individually or in the aggregate will result in a material change in the level of investment risk associated with an investment in any of the funds required vote approval of the proposed standardized fundamental investment restrictions requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of each fund of nafv ii which as defined in the  act means the affirmative vote of the lesser of i more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund or ii  or more of the shares of the fund present at the meeting if more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund are represented at the meeting in person or by proxy the approval of this proposal by any fund is not dependent or conditioned on the approval of any other fund the board unanimously recommends that shareholders of each fund vote for approval of the proposed standardized fundamental investment restrictions � � proposal  all funds to

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
