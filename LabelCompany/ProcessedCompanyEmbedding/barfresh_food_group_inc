microcap stock please be advised of the risks associated with microcap stocks the text of the interview is an abridged transcription of a conversation between lazarus investment partners lllp and barfresh food group inc barfresh had no input into the selection of the title of this article nor into the commentary and analysis that precedes the interview lazarus is a shareholder of barfresh and received no compensation for this article introduction my investment in barfresh food group otcqbbrfh was inspired by jack simplot a farmer born in dubuque iowa in  jack had no more than an eighth grade education he was a tightwad who reused nails wore the same glasses for  years and hunted for lost golf balls at a california ranch in  jack sealed a deal by handshake with ray kroc founder of mcdonalds and became a french fry supplier to the growing restaurant chain by the time jack died in  he was the th richest person in the country with a fortune estimated at  billion i view barfresh as my chance to become a mini jack simplot before i tell you more let me note that unless you happen to have an interest in small and highly speculative companies read no further i see tremendous opportunity for barfresh but its all on the come ill discuss the risks and upside ahead i just want to give fair warning what they do the barfresh story begins with ceo riccardo delle costes chain of smoothie bars in australia seeing that he was losing customers who didnt have the patience to wait in line during peak hours riccardo invented a preportioned smoothie pack rather than have to wash strawberries peel bananas and measure and assemble all the ingredients with each order restaurant staff now had everything they needed preassembled in the packs riccardo then marketed these packs to restaurant chains looking for an easy way to serve blended beverages one highprofile account he won was subway who adopted riccardos smoothie solution for their australian stores barfresh is now bringing this concept to the us and other markets big picture smoothies tap into some of todays big food trends consumers are seeking betterforyou products that still taste good until barfresh came along adding blended beverages to the menu of a quick serve restaurant qsr had proven to be a challenge qsrs are process and volume oriented with each inch of counter real estate and minute of labor time carefully accounted for it is labor intensive to have someone washing fruit and measuring all the ingredients the dairy and produce used in blended drinks spoil quickly restaurants may not have frontofstore access to a blender freezer or ice machine designing store layout and workflow to handle a high volume of smoothies is complex competitive differentiation barfresh offers all the ingredients for a smoothie shake or frappe in a single portioncontrolled package dump the contents into a blender add water blend and serve as simple as it sounds this solution is both patentprotected and addresses the operational challenges of offering a blended beverage in a high volume environment other blended beverage solutions on the market today have assorted shortcomings whereas the barfresh solution is all natural with whole pieces of fruit in the package competitors offer syrups and powders other solutions require the addition of fruit juice ice or milk  ingredients barfresh includes in each pack lessons from the behemoth mcdonalds nyse mcd has been a pioneer in bringing blended beverages to the quick serve industry eager to tap into the growing specialty beverage category mcdonalds franchisees have been paying  to install beverage bars at mccafes from this investment they are expecting to add  to  in annual smoothie and frappe revenue for the average franchise source link this is very significant since the typical mcdonalds franchise has annual sales of about  million store owners are highly resistant to spending six figure amounts retrofitting their restaurants for a beverage platform the barfresh solution allows them to add such a platform without the capital expenditure throw in barfreshs blender manufacturer partnerships and franchisees can add blended beverages to their menu with no upfront capital cost just a small amount tacked onto each pack this combination of the barfresh pack plus a financed high end blender and minifreezer if needed removes one of the single biggest points of resistance ie capex from franchisors who are looking for beverage solutions to offer their franchisees why qsrs are so interested to understand further why blended beverages are so valuable to qsrsand for that matter grocery chains delis and other food service venuesconsider two things first theres a dead zone between lunch and dinner when store traffic wanes a smoothie shake or frappe is unlike a fountain soft drink in that it is more filling and consumers can justify a store visit just for the blended beverage second operators are battling falling margins across their menus input costs for core offeringsburgers pizza sandwichesare on the rise while qsrs are everforced to compete on a price basis a blended beverage can be the single highest dollar margin beverage for an operator after alcohol the gross profit for a smoothie can be more than the entire revenue to an operator from a soft drink commercialization barfreshs business model is rather simple it outsources its manufacturing so it can focus on marketing its beverage solutions to quick serve and casual dining restaurants grocery stores for their deli counters hotel chains institutional cafeterias and the like two of the largest food distributors in the country are barfreshs resellers complemented by smaller restaurant sales groups that offer niche coverage aside from the large accounts ill soon address barfresh has been announcing small account wins such as a  unit mexican food chain based in detroit and  shakeys locations in southern california as distributors continue to add accounts like these an attractive and diverse customer base is developing what the market is missing the most important part to the barfresh investment story in my view is the big accounts the company is pursuing barfresh announced that it signed an agreement to develop a new drink platform for a qsr with approximately  domestic locations barfresh expects to begin a partial rollout with this customer in  barfresh also announced an agreement to develop beverages for a  unit chain and later added that test markets and flavors were approved a full rollout is targeted for this summer there are also another  stores that the company is in advanced stage talks with this includes a hotel and casino group that is undergoing testing some of these relationships leave barfresh as the exclusive blended beverage partner in the below ceo interview you can find details on the status of these conversations on top of all these advanced conversations with collectively  locations there are another  or so locations that barfresh is in earlier stage talks with thats about  locations altogether then there is also an opportunity the company is working on that will allow them to add many smaller accounts in one swoop management has guided investors to expect significant progress and announcements in  today barfresh trades at about  million in market cap with almost no revenue its so easy to brush off the company as being just a story with no sales and an unspecified opportunity to land a qsr listen closer to what management has been saying and you get a different perspective at an investment conference earlier this month barfreshs ceo said that its not a question of if but a question of when he repeated that sentiment in the interview the trials with the chains keep advancing and the pipeline of opportunities continues to grow one big customer win and the entire barfresh story changes this could happen over the next  to  months all previously announced customer partnerships are not only ongoing but have advanced over the past few quarters bagger possibility if its not a bagger every  units of a restaurant chain barfresh adds could bring at least  million in annual revenue to barfresh thats assuming the average store sells  blended beverages a week which is the bottom end of estimates the estimates vary by chain but many chains think they can sell several hundred each week per store mcdonalds stores sell  a week on average imagine if barfresh wins the  chain account or the  chain account they are in talks with thats  million or  million a year respectively in recurring high margin revenue  from one customer at the bottom end of estimates jack simplot  you have to have some faith to invest in something like this it is not for everybody you cant justify the market cap today based on last years sales or earnings you need to be the type of investor that can envision what this company can become if they start winning    large accounts imagine if in  months time the company is in  stores selling  units per store per week that could be  million a year in revenue its a high margin product so at  net profit margins and a x multiple  appropriate for a growing high margin recurring revenue business  you have  billion in market cap which is x todays price yes these are numbers based on the roughest of guesses and are almost unimaginable today but even if they are off by  you still have a bagger on your hands switching costs winning a large qsr account takes time there are teams of food scientists and bean counters that decide everything from which flavors to use to how big the servings should be testing is done in individual markets before expanding to the next market for competitive reasons barfreshs customers limit what barfresh can announce about ongoing product development and test marketing this information scarcity creates an opportunity for investors who can tolerate the silence even though it can mean suffering through long gaps between updates i find it helpful to keep in mind that it all makes the barfresh solution very sticky once a custom product is developed and the chain spent a year testing it and already added it to their menus nationwide that chain is likely to stick around for some time last i heard the jr simplot company was still supplying mcdonalds with half their french fries risks abound as true as it is that one customer can turn barfresh into a homerun there are ample ways to lose on an investment here lets start with the fact that the company has minimal revenues today to lose nothing actually has to go wrong you lose if nothing goes right then you have the risk of delays the way these things go it often takes longer and costs more than you think frozen drinks have seasonality and if the company does not execute in time for summer  as they hope to summer  is a long time away my view here is that the chains in testing are likely targeting summer  so im expecting to see progress and announcements over the first half of the new year theres plenty of room to be skeptical about barfresh landing a qsr as encouraged as i am by the interest its always a process for a company to win a large account let alone a small company like barfresh and despite barfreshs patents restaurants can still go with competing solutions or develop their own blended beverage solution inhouse then theres the risk of success what if they actually do win a large account can they service it what if the  unit chain comes on line and stores average at  units a week thats  million servings to produce each year for just one customer youll read about the companys manufacturing capacity in the interview and theres a lot of ground to cover between current capacity and those kind of volumes conclusion i like my chances with this one i see asymmetric riskreward the upside potential is tens of times the current share price i am expecting to see positive newsflow and progress with the qsrs throughout the first half of  as everyone works towards a summer ramp insiders own a lot of stock so theyre motivated to make things happen one more point on jack simplot in comparison to simplots  billion fortune at his  passing when ray kroc died in  his fortune was estimated at only  million  million in  terms it was better to have been a french fry supplier to mcdonalds than to be mcdonalds ceo interview riccardo was kind enough to share the barfresh story with me recently over complimentary mango smoothies no less i am pleased to share a transcript of the conversation with you barfresh offers all natural portioncontrolled blended beverage solutions to the food service industry where did this idea come from riccardo it came from a problem i had i used to own some juice bars similar to the jamba juice nasdaqjmba type of setup id have long lines at the front of the juice bar and see customers line up but then walk away when they werent serviced fast enough i figured there had to be a better way so i set out to invent a product by analyzing the sales data i picked the three topselling items and preportioned the ingredients that went into those items for use during the rush time we increased our throughput significantly during the rush periods and that was the beginning of the story the idea is about being able to create exactly the same product that a juice bar could create but without all the hassles of wastage the space requirements the labor and the time required to make it what are some of the advantages of the barfresh solution and how is it different from what competitors have to offer riccardo its complex in a quick serve or commercial environment to prepare premium quality smoothies in volume do you have an ice machine do you have a blender who will clean cut and measure all the fruit pieces where will you store all the different flavors of yogurts and sorbets will you use all the ingredients in time to account for varied spoilage the barfresh solution is really an allinone solution we have all the ingredients in one pack you dont need to add anything beyond water its significantly different from anything else out there in the marketplace since other solutions require you to add ice or juice or milk or yogurt or they have inferior ingredients such as powders and syrups we are all natural and solve the cost and workflow problems that the store operators have in making freshly blended beverages because we are portioncontrolled its consistent every time and it doesnt have any waste actually with the largevolume stores some of them use automatic machines which need to be plumbed into the store which have a high cost of capital for the operator in comparison to ours where the store operator only needs the cost of a traditional blender this is relatively inexpensive and we also have a blender program in partnership with some blender companies where theyve got zero cost upfront to add a smoothie platform would you talk a little bit about the patents around the product riccardo in terms of barriers to entry there are actually two big things to consider one is the patents so weve got patents granted in quite a number of countries around the world and still pending in others as part of an international worldwide pct so worldwide patents but in addition to the patents which obviously are a barrier to entry we also have significant ip in the manufacturing process the manufacturing process is quite involved we have a number of ingredients that are going into the pack that are all of different substance matters being weighed individually and portioned into a singleserve pack in a highspeed environment and doing that consistently with low wastage theres a lot of knowhow also associated with that as well why are qsrs quick service restaurants suddenly interested in adding blended beverages to their menus riccardo there is a huge push from both the consumers and in turn the store operators to look for healthier betterforyou products as a result there is very strong background interest in an all natural fruitbased product like our smoothie our entire range is premised on being better for you and having lower calories than what you would traditionally expect from other types of beverages restaurant operators are under intense pressure to grow sales and push back against the margin compression they have to battle our product is perfect for them smoothies and frappes and shakes are traditionally considered a snack day part this allows them to make good use of what otherwise would be dead time on the clockthe space between lunch and dinner now customers have a reason to come in during the late afternoon and have a blended drink and in many instances we can be the single highest dollar margin beverage product they sell other than maybe alcoholic drinks in some cases with our customers the amount of profit margin dollars that they make from our product is actually greater than the revenue from any other nonalcoholic beverage revenue that they offer so they are very excited when you appear before a large qsr and they want to know who else has used the solution and how they know it would actually fit into their workflow what do you point at to give confidence that you have a viable solution riccardo this product format has been used successfully in other fastfood chains around the world most notably in the subway restaurants throughout australia and new zealand so we know that the product format works very well within a qsr environment the product itself solves a lot of problems that your typical fastfood chain or restaurant operator faces in making blended beverages such as the amount of space required to make these beverages the amount of wastage that typically goes with these beverages the capital cost of the equipment required and also the consistency of the product they also do extensive testing before rolling out anything nationally this takes some time but works to our advantage because after companies make the kind of rd and test marketing investments they do with us by the time they add it to their menus officially they are pretty confident that it will work and are very reluctant to switch to another vendors solution do you plan on doing the manufacturing yourself riccardo absolutely not we have a very strategic approach to how were rolling out in the market we use contract manufacturers there are a number of reasons for that key is weve got a controlled food cost and were also able to ramp up very quickly nationwide with low capex required to service the types of volumes that were going after if you didnt outsource to land the accounts that were working with and the expected volumes that we are anticipating you would require very very large amounts of capital to be invested not only the capital but also the lead time required to actually build out spec and build out factories large enough to be able to support the kind of volumes were anticipating which would almost make it too difficult to be able to service an account because it would be too long a lead time to build out to be able to service the account so weve been very strategic about using contract manufacturers it gives us controlled food costs it also enables us to deal with the largest cost of our product which is freight typically a large franchise will be serviced by a number of food service distribution warehouses we are able to analyze the volume throughput of those warehouses into the chain and typically youll find that  of the volume will go through say six or seven of those distribution warehouses and were actually able to go and find the contract manufacturers within close proximity to those warehouses to again further reduce our overall cost of servicing those customers which delivers us higher margins were being very strategic about it it allows us to focus on what we do best and that is sell the product and set the customers up for success as of right now how much manufacturing capacity do you have and how long would it take if you needed to add to that riccardo were at about  million units per year in capacity going to add in another  million to where we are currently timing to add to the capacity it is approximately three to four months to set up additional lines so were able to ramp up very quickly and in multiple locations around the country i think a lot of investors will hear what you have to say and respond a really interesting product but who knows if it will ever gain traction what can you tell them regarding the progress youve made towards commercialization riccardo that is the aspect of our business that is easy to misunderstand weve made tremendous commercialization progress its just not on our income statement yet so its not super obvious weve been very active in setting the framework for the business weve set our manufacturing up weve got our team onboard weve developed flavors for the general market for the food service distribution weve also developed customized flavors for some of the major accounts that weve been working with we are at different places within each franchise or within each chain that we have been working with for example we announced that we are working with a store chain a store chain and a hotel group with some of them we are still developing some flavors with others were actually in market testing and were growing those market tests that were doing we are also increasing the range within those tests that were doing to include for example alcoholic bar mixes at the hotel group all of the agreements that weve entered into are progressing well in some of them we are the exclusive blended beverage partner in addition to that we have some undisclosed significant opportunities of equivalent size and opportunity to what has already been announced in terms of the chain business and in addition to that from a general food service perspective we also have some significant opportunities with some of the largest food service operators on a national basis this represents ways we can add many small accounts over a short period these are all very specific conversations and relationships working towards regional or national roll outs the timing of each is hard to predict and it varies by account but i expect to have some really exciting things to announce in  id love to get more specific but our partners generally like to keep a lower profile about their menu plans so i have to respect that you mentioned a unit chain you mentioned a unit chain you mentioned a hotel group ive seen press releases from major food distribution companies you partner with would you recap some of the highlights of the key conversations that are going on now riccardo so in relation to the accounts weve already announced for example with the store chain we announcedas you can imagine its a very large franchise group and were still working with that group on flavor development things are progressing well and we have a calendar set for  well see a lot of testing working towards a partial rollout next year and hopefully a nationwide rollout in  the store chain has been also progressing well were significantly more advanced with that account as you can appreciate smaller is easier to work through they are in market testing we expect further market testing to occur with a rollout for  for summer theres a big push to capture summer  with regard to the hotel group we are now extending the testing to include bar mix items in some bar locations within the casino group overall the customers expectations range in terms of volume for these groups anywhere from  or  units a week per store up to  units a week per store there are varying levels of sophistication within each franchise and also demographics and product mix within each restaurant group or food service operator but the numbers are extremely large in terms of what our expectations are over time once we receive full market penetration within each group you mentioned theres a fairly rich pipeline of opportunities youre pursuing that youve not publicly disclosed the names of or the specifics of any color on what that looks like either individually or as a collective riccardo what weve told investors is that we have just under  locations altogether that we are actively engaged with and have agreements with to either develop products or go into testing for future rollout this includes the  and  unit restaurant groups we just discussed in addition to that we have at least the equivalent amount that we have not disclosed specifics of as yet that we are at various levels of discussions both advanced and some in negotiation im not talking about where we sent an email or something but where there is a genuine and concrete interest and conversation so roughly  units overall and we hope to make progress in graduating some of these conversations to more formal agreements im sure it varies by chain but typical time from start to finish until they make a decision for a national rollout  how long does that take riccardo this is probably our biggest issue with the various franchises we wish theyd move faster and investors are always asking us to predict the timing of things we really dont control some of them are a lot more analytical than others for example with one group theres a person project team whereas with others you could be dealing with two or three people but typical for a very large chain is a year and a half sometimes longer from an initial contact through testing to national rollout but along the way there are milestones and regional sales what i can say is that were well along the way with several parties the pipeline keeps growing and the conversations keep advancing its fair to expect us to demonstrate progress over the next few quarters it wont take years large accounts always grab headlines but you also referenced a strategy of pursuing a number of smaller accounts riccardo absolutely up until now our strategy has been specifically focused on targeting the larger qsrs and the larger accounts purely because the cost of acquisition of the smaller accounts is high relative to the sales involved but we also have partners reselling our products to smaller chains and mom and pops and were getting traction in that department as well something important here  i cant disclose the specifics just yet what i can tell you is that we have a very significant opportunity that would be the equivalent of all those stores that weve spoken about again with some major food service operators to execute on a what we call the street business which are all the nonmajor chain accounts meaning ones that would be serviced by a third party rather than us directly this would give us an enormous amount of penetration into the marketplace for general food service its a way for us to win many many smaller account at one shot i am not promising that this will happen only that its something we are working on and making progress on and that it could be very very significant can you walk me through the economics to barfresh of winning a large account riccardo sure consider a list price range of  to  per unit to wholesale for the major accounts it can be considerably less than that and for other accounts considerably higher there are many variables but lets use  a unit to keep the math simple i mentioned before that our customers are looking at  units sold per week at the low end some are anticipating  mcdonalds is selling approximately  units weekly per store this is an average for the week over the year we do have seasonality so if i use  units per week per store every  stores we add can bring us  units in weekly sales or  million units annually at  a unit the numbers get really big really fast even with just one major customer win we spoke earlier that we have collectively  stores that we are in formal talks with and another  that we are in an earlier stage with one large customer changes the whole dynamics of our business what are you anticipating in terms of margins for the company riccardo without saying specific numbers before our competitors have to see them our margins are quite solid and we expect them to grow as we get greater volumes streamlined manufacturing and greater cost savings from raw material procurement and freight and logistics we run a very lean low overhead cost model right now our cash burn rate is around  a month and by operating with the contract manufacturers were able to scale up very quickly to do the higher volumes and still maintain a low overhead we only need to see very minor success to break even but does growth also cause the need for significant overhead expense you win one customer that adds a lot of revenue but all of a sudden you need a lot of infrastructure perhaps riccardo not exactly and thats the reason why were so excited about the business going forward you know at the end of the day whether its one chain account that has  stores or  stores we dont need  people to manage that account its still only one account and the capex or the additional infrastructure required  were only servicing the food service distributors warehouses they may have  warehouses that were delivering to so were either delivering in pallet half truckload or truckload to those warehouses the increases are minimal and they are simultaneous with revenue growth that because of the nature of customer trials we have a lot of visibility to the year is coming to a close you probably have  in mind what do you view as the key goals for the company over the upcoming year riccardo being conservative we would expect to have a rollout of one to two major accounts throughout  in addition to that wed also expect to have testing in  for another very major key account thats based on what we have in the pipe without anything being added over the course of the year what do you view as the biggest risk for investors riccardo the one thing that we cant control is the amount of time that the franchise groups take to work through their internal processes from our perspective its more a matter of when rather than if i would say that the timing of completion of the sales cycle would probably be our biggest challenge what about the risk of handling growth if or when you do end up landing a large account it will be a dramatic change to the company how should investors think about that risk riccardo thats a good question and its something that weve recognized upfront weve done two things in preparation for that weve begun discussions in aligning partnerships with some very large multinationals and national companies that are equipped to be able to assist us in handling the growth very rapidly and two importantly weve brought on a very experienced management team that knows how to scale part of our management team  weve got former senior pepsico executives a senior product development executive from mrs fields and a cfo with experience in public growth companies they get us into some very senior executives within the fastfood or within the restaurant groups which has given us a very good reception and once we have the introduction the product has really done the rest of the talking times up any closing thoughts riccardo the single biggest pushback we get from investors is that we have minimal revenues to date everyones looking for revenues right now they will come for us its really about getting the major accounts and the customers in the pipeline ive walked you through some sample numbers the opportunity at hand is enormous again my belief is that its not a matter of if its a matter of when and at the rate at which were getting new customers in the pipeline were extremely excited about the future thank you very much riccardo thanks disclosure
