navigation menu eagle overview company background eagle is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing injectable products primarily in the areas of critical care orphan diseases and oncology our goal is to provide safer and more convenient solutions for patients and healthcare professionals with optimized formulations we develop proprietary enhancements to fdaapproved drugs utilizing the b regulatory pathway this strategy expedites time for development fda review and approval we further seek to extend the patent life of our products through orphan drug exclusivity new intellectual property protection andor  years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity these last allowances come by way of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  or the hatch waxman act industry background intravenous injection is a preferred drug delivery route for many biopharmaceuticals the reference injectable brands that are the primary focus of the eagle portfolio have an estimated value of  billion furthermore the united states injectable market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of  due to several factors including label expansion for approved products which increases the patient pool for such products a pipeline of injectable medications at various stages of clinical development the increasing incidence of certain diseases that may be treated with injectable medications such as cancer and autoimmune disorders we estimate that the current annual revenue of the overall us market we target is approximately  billion in an attempt to capture a larger share of the overall market we have begun exploring other product opportunities using the b regulatory pathway in addition to pursuing label expansions of approved eagle brands the limitations of inmarket products we believe that many injectable products used in acute care settings have suboptimal characteristics these other products may not fully meet the needs of patients and healthcare professionals for instance some existing drugs may be packaged inefficiently while others come in formulations that require reconstitution or dilution or are otherwise difficult or inconvenient to prepare some drugs risk exposing workers to cytotoxic compounds and can result in dosing errors these suboptimal characteristics can lead to wasted quantities of drug inefficiencies in staff time and constrained work flow reduced shelf life and the need for reconstitution of multiple vials in an emergency situation at eagle we work diligently to create improved formulations that address these issues our competitive strengths reformulations that capitalize on market opportunities our products have the potential to benefit both patients and healthcare professionals these reformulations of other injectable drugs could provide improvements including reduced chance of dosing errors through elimination of drug reconstitution less drug waste improved safety by reduced exposure to cytotoxic vapors reduced drug infusion time less drug volume administered fast reconstitution in emergency situations compliance eagle is committed to conducting business in accordance
