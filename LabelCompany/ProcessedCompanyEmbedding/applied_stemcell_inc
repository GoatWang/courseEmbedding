limited space available commonly significant positive results are seen in  to  months parkinson’s treatment treatment the treatment performed at our clinics is a breakthrough medical procedure where stem cells cellular building blocks are usually administered intravenously and subcutaneously under the skin in parkinsons patients the whole procedure takes approximately one hour and has no known negative side effects following the treatment the fetal stem cells will travel throughout the body detecting damaged cells and tissue and attempts to restore them the fetal stem cells can also stimulate existing normal cells and tissues to operate at a higher level of function boosting the body’s own repair mechanisms to aid in the healing process these highly adaptive cells then remain in the body continually locating and repairing any damage they encounter safety as with any medical treatment safety should be of the highest priority the stem cells used in our treatment undergo extensive screening for possible infection and impurities utilizing tests more sophisticated than those regularly used in the united states for stem cell research and transplant our testing process ensures we use only the healthiest cells to enable the safest and most effective fetal stem cell treatment possible and unlike other types of stem cells there is no danger of the body’s rejection of fetal stem cells due to the fact they have no antigenicity cellular fingerprint this unique quality eliminates the need for drugs used to suppress the immune system which can leave a patient exposed to serious infections results with over  patients treated stem cell of america has achieved positive results with a wide variety of illnesses conditions and injuries often in cases where the diseases continued to worsen our patients have reported substantial improvements following the stem cell treatment commonly positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment in parkinsons

questions frequently asked questions does the stem cell treatment have any age requirements no stem cell of america accepts patients of all ages how much does the treatment cost there are multiple factors in determining the cost of treatment please contact us to have your case evaluated does health insurance cover any portion of the treatment cost no the treatment is not covered by private or public health insurance do you accept patients from outside of the united states yes we routinely accept patients from canada england australia and other countries all over the world is the stem cell treatment administered by stem cell of america safe yes the cells are tested for  different criteria including viral bacterial and fungal infections as well as viability moreover we use pcr dna testing which is far more sophisticated and expensive than the screening tests routinely used in the united states for other stem cell treatments will my body reject the fetal stem cells no fetal stem cellsare “immune privileged” this means that you can give the cells to any patient without matching use of immunosuppressive drugs and without rejection therefore they will not cause adverse reactions in the patient such as graftversushost disease because of this special property of the cells there is no risk of rejection or adverse reaction which can leave the body vulnerable to serious diseases and infection does your stem cell treatment have any side effects our fetal stem cell treatment has no known negative side effects what diseases and conditions is the stem cell treatment available for a partial list of disease and conditions that stem cell of america has successfully treated includes alzheimers arthritis autism brain damage cancer cerebral palsy chronic pain cystic fibrosis diabetes epilepsy fibromyalgia heart disease kidney disease liver disease lung disease lupus multiple sclerosis muscular dystrophy parkinsons seizures spinal cord injury stroke and others due to the rapid advances in stem cell science some diseases or conditions may not be listed please contact us to get additional information how quickly will i see results after the stem cell treatment every person is of course different each of our body’s healing mechanisms work at a unique pace as they are influenced by many factors commonly significant positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment at times these changes can occur in as little as weeks or even days after receiving treatment how many stem cell treatments will i need after the first treatment the fetal stem cells will continue to proliferate and repair some patients choose to receive treatment more than one time to expedite the healing process the decision is yours if you decide to repeat the treatment usually a waiting period of  months is recommended how do the fetal stem cells actually work to bring about healing fetal stem cells are the cellular building blocks of the  cell types within the body the fetal stem cells used by stem cell of america remain in an undifferentiated state and therefore are capable of becoming any tissue organ or cell type within the body fetal stem cells also release cytokines cytokines are cellderived hormonelike polypeptides that regulate cellular replication differentiation and activation cytokines can bring normal cells and tissues to a higher level of function allowing the body’s own healing mechanisms to partner with the transplanted fetal stem cells for repair and new growth how many people have been treated with my specific disease or condition in the past  decades stem cell of america has arranged for the treatment of over three thousand patients with fetal stem cells the number of patients continues to grow please contact us to get

seek better representation of human genetics and physiology their similarity to human physiology and pathology makes them a better in vivo model than mice for the study of cardiovascular diabetics neurological psychiatric and autoimmune dysfunctions using applied stemcell incs proprietary targatt™ and crisprcas technologies we can generate sitespecific transgenic rats in as little as  months the novel targatt™ system uses phic integrase to insert any gene of interest into a specific docking site that was preengineered into an intergenic and transcriptionally active genomic locus advantages of the targatt™ system high integration efficiency mediated by phic integrase reduces time and cost sitespecific integration at a preselected genomic locus  eliminates position effect and ensures high expression levels of the transgene integration at intergenic region  ensures that no internal genes are interrupted single copy gene integration  eliminates repeatinduced gene silencing and genomic instability sitespecific integration allows a precise comparison of the effects of the transgenes among different lines please contact us for more details and to explore our other custom

limited space available commonly significant positive results are seen in  to  months parkinson’s treatment treatment the treatment performed at our clinics is a breakthrough medical procedure where stem cells cellular building blocks are usually administered intravenously and subcutaneously under the skin in parkinsons patients the whole procedure takes approximately one hour and has no known negative side effects following the treatment the fetal stem cells will travel throughout the body detecting damaged cells and tissue and attempts to restore them the fetal stem cells can also stimulate existing normal cells and tissues to operate at a higher level of function boosting the body’s own repair mechanisms to aid in the healing process these highly adaptive cells then remain in the body continually locating and repairing any damage they encounter safety as with any medical treatment safety should be of the highest priority the stem cells used in our treatment undergo extensive screening for possible infection and impurities utilizing tests more sophisticated than those regularly used in the united states for stem cell research and transplant our testing process ensures we use only the healthiest cells to enable the safest and most effective fetal stem cell treatment possible and unlike other types of stem cells there is no danger of the body’s rejection of fetal stem cells due to the fact they have no antigenicity cellular fingerprint this unique quality eliminates the need for drugs used to suppress the immune system which can leave a patient exposed to serious infections results with over  patients treated stem cell of america has achieved positive results with a wide variety of illnesses conditions and injuries often in cases where the diseases continued to worsen our patients have reported substantial improvements following the stem cell treatment commonly positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment in parkinsons

factors in determining the cost of treatment please contact us to have your case evaluated does health insurance cover any portion of the treatment cost no the treatment is not covered by private or public health insurance do you accept patients from outside of the united states yes we routinely accept patients from canada england australia and other countries all over the world is the stem cell treatment administered by stem cell of america safe yes the cells are tested for  different criteria including viral bacterial and fungal infections as well as viability moreover we use pcr dna testing which is far more sophisticated and expensive than the screening tests routinely used in the united states for other stem cell treatments will my body reject the fetal stem cells no fetal stem cellsare “immune privileged” this means that you can give the cells to any patient without matching use of immunosuppressive drugs and without rejection therefore they will not cause adverse reactions in the patient such as graftversushost disease because of this special property of the cells there is no risk of rejection or adverse reaction which can leave the body vulnerable to serious diseases and infection does your stem cell treatment have any side effects our fetal stem cell treatment has no known negative side effects what diseases and conditions is the stem cell treatment available for

person is of course different each of our body’s healing mechanisms work at a unique pace as they are influenced by many factors commonly significant positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment at times these changes can occur in as little as weeks or even days after receiving treatment how many stem cell treatments will i need after the first treatment the fetal stem cells will continue to proliferate and repair some patients choose to receive treatment more than one time to expedite the healing process the decision is yours if you decide to repeat the treatment usually a waiting period of  months is recommended how do the fetal stem cells actually work to bring about healing fetal stem cells are the cellular building blocks of the  cell types within the body the fetal stem cells used by stem cell of america remain in an undifferentiated state and therefore are capable of becoming any tissue organ or cell type within the body fetal stem cells also release cytokines cytokines are cellderived hormonelike polypeptides that regulate cellular replication differentiation and activation cytokines can bring normal cells and tissues to a higher level of function allowing the body’s own healing mechanisms to partner with the transplanted fetal stem cells for repair and new growth how many people have been treated with my specific disease or condition
