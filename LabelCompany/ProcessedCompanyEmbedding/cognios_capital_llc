investment approach  business wire cognios capital launches new mutual fund with innovative investment approach cognios market neutral large cap fund uses longshort approach and proprietary rotarometm strategy to deliver longterm performance against sp  january    am eastern standard time leawood kanbusiness wirecognios capital llc today announced the launch of the cognios market neutral large cap fund cogmx  cogix – the firm’s inaugural mutual fund with a goal to provide individuals and institutions with an investment product previously reserved for hedge fund clients the investment strategy of the fund aims to outperform the sp  index over time by purchasing and selling short large capitalization us equities through its proprietary rotarometm valuation method “in times of unpredictable and volatile markets investors are seeking longterm performance regardless of market conditions and a management team they can trust” said john brandmeyer chief executive officer of cognios capital “the goal of this new mutual fund is to give retail investors access to a proprietary longshort equity strategy strategies of this type have generally only been available to institutions and wealthy individuals through hedge funds” the fund differs from traditional longonly mutual funds by employing risk management techniques such as the use of hedging through short sales this hedging strategy has the potential to limit the downside risk of the portfolio as well as the potential to generate alpha for the fund additionally the fund is uniquely indexed to the sp  whereas most market neutral funds are indexed to treasury bills “there is increasing demand from retail investors for expertise in alternative investment management particularly for investment options that are liquid and less correlated to broader equity markets” said jon angrist chief investment officer of cognios capital “our new longshort mutual fund approach responds well to these demands and offers a new strategy for retail investors to diversify their portfolios” the noload fund offers two classes of shares – an investor class cogmx and an institutional class cogix the minimum investment is  for the investor class and  for the institutional class investors generally may meet the minimum investment amount for the institutional class by aggregating multiple accounts within the fund if desired there is no subsequent investment minimum the fund launched with an initial m of seed capital from management a unique mindset in investment management founded in  as an independent alternative investment management firm cognios capital strives to change the way people think about the investment industry by providing investorfriendly services and investment strategies that aim to perform well independent of broad market conditions in early  this unique positioning attracted james e stowers iii the former chairman and chief executive officer of american century investments who now serves as a cognios capital advisory board member “cognios capital was born out of a clientcentric mentality based on the premise that investors should receive longterm investment performance transparency and liquidity” said stowers “i have always believed in the golden rule and at cognios we align our interests with that of our clients in order to provide unbiased counsel and responsive service” cognios capital’s proprietary rotarometm strategy is a fundamental quantitative stock selection approach that focuses on a company’s return on tangible assets “rota” and return on market value of equity “rome” this strategy seeks to determine a company’s intrinsic value and compare that value to the current market price of its stock our rotarome™ methodology uses timetested metrics to buy great companies at what we believe are great prices said brian machtley executive vice president head of research and portfolio management and cofounder of cognios capital “in general this approach can be considered a valuebased investment strategy but it also incorporates the premise that growth is an important component of assessing a stock’s intrinsic value” prior to founding cognios capital machtley was a senior analyst at helzberg angrist capital llc an associate portfolio manager at the discovery group a hedge fund and an analyst at houlihan lokey comanager of the fund and chief investment officer of cognios capital jonathan angrist previously held portfolio management positions at helzberg angrist capital llc and buffalo funds and was a principal with harvest partners inc a

index  the sp  index is a market value weighted index the index includes  of the leading companies in the leading industries of the us economy capturing  coverage of the us equities alpha  the riskadjusted ie betaadjusted outperformance or underperformance of the portfolio relative to the stock market since the fund has generally attempted to hedge out all of the overall market’s returns on a betaadjusted basis through its short positions all of the fund’s net return is expected to be solely the alpha generated by the portfolio managers less all of the fund’s fees and expenses as with any mutual fund there are risks to investing the value of the fund’s assets will fluctuate as the equity market fluctuates although the betaadjusted market neutral focus of the fund should reduce the effect of general market fluctuations on the valuation of the fund as a whole utilization of leverage such as borrowings and shorting positions involves certain risks to the fund’s shareholders including potential for higher volatility of the net asset value “nav” of the fund’s shares and the relatively greater effect of portfolio holdings on the nav of the shares the fund may not always be able to close out a short position on favorable terms short sales involve the risk that the fund will incur a loss by subsequently buying a security at a higher price than the price at which it sold the security short an investor should consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing to obtain a prospectus containing this and other information
