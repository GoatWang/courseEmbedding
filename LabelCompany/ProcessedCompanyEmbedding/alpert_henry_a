power to destroy poverty for life you have my word i searched for results i  attended as many seminars bought lots of offline and online materials but non worked for me i kept on taking risk spent my hard earn money on seminars unit i attended one very last seminar where i was taught how to export three easy products with very little amount of money   i digged harder for resultat first it was not easy for me to understand but with devauting more time on my computer and the source provided for me i finally got    how to    what to and   where tosolution solvedin addition to thati developed my own strategy which earned me my first  buyer in  days since then i have being using my own strategies to crack where buyers client or customers are locatedi repeated same process again and again if

building your businessyou have more time for family and friendsyou will no more wake up am to fight to get to work on time no more am  pm slavery job little intro about me im albert henry and i been making a great living through exportation of agro produce exportation business products since since those early days ive gone on to make silence income from naira to dollars  pound  euros and even became  exporter among the best of the best in this great country nigeria ive also taught hundreds of people how to truly make a lot of income through export of agriculture produce which they still do till date i kept getting positive messages on a daily basics testimonies hereand yes i can show you my nice big dream house my fancy sports cars and all the checks that i make each and every month from past clients but would much rather show you exactly what i did to get all of those thingsive already been doing well with this for years now  ive been in the trenches for so long i know what it takes to make a great living from the export dealsthats why id love to show you how ive achieved all of my success so you can simply copy my ways of ruining small scale export of agro producesince i started teaching over  years ago and after helping hundreds of people make full time income from exporting in their spare time i still get asked how its done on a daily bases  the opportunity in export business is super massiveask any major player in this businessthese write up is not only for those already in the export business but even for the new comersto commence foodstuff business on a small scalecompany registration is optional since you are doing it on a small scale which means you are sending the foodstuff items through the help of courier companies eg    emx  nipost  ups and the rest but if you are on a tight budject and want to send large quantities  from tons you can use the services of freight forwarders at narco nig which is extremely cheapthe requirements include start up capital of betweenn and nan emaila mobile phone andan account with a reputable bank here in nigeriahowever having a domiciliary account is better you don’t need previous experience in the field but you should have a “good head” for organizing and negotiation you can get support from an organization called association of microentrepreneurs of nigeria amen to allow you to get nafdac number only if the product need customized attention note   only for customized productsthe volume of nigerian exporters of foodstuff to those countries are still on a very low level considering the estimated  million people of nigerian residing outside the country with the majority living in the united kingdom uk and the us  i learnt malazia as taken over    this is a great opportunity to sell to this category of people the few exporters of african foodstuff cannot meet with the demand of nigerians which populations are increasing everyday in the us and uk  i know that you’re more than tired of hearing bold claims and empty promises from shady people who only want to take your money and run away  it’s clear that you have had enough of thisbut today i can promise you that if you keep reading you will find a few surprises that are going to positively affect your overall life…and this is no exaggeration – it can truly happen if you stick here with me and pay close attention to what i have to say to youbut first before we get into the juicy details here’s some advice…listen there’s something that clearly is not working for youyou’re not making the kind of money that will make a

course after course after coursestop believing the lies of many unscrupulous marketers who only want to have you on their list so they can spam you to death with new promotions every day they did it to me back then it’s just about time to end this nonsenselet dive into real business nowto start an export business money is not the most important thing but it will play a fast role  you need to have the knowledge and the right idea and the market needed there is assistance to any nigerian with the right will power what you need to succeed are integrity honesty and diligencea lot of nigerian are operating a highly lucrative homebased export company and they are constantly making a steady income of between  and  monthly and regularly   with no capital investment no risk and at their spare time the profit from the first transaction can be ploughed back and an investor can be able to build up his capital base to start this business all you need to have on standby are mobile phonebank account

peace herb alpert – music herb alpert facebook twitter music the lonely bull the lonely bull original release date  reissue date  the colossus that is am records starts right here with the first album by the s instrumental juggernaut known as the tijuana brass true there was no “tijuana brass” per se at this time just herb alpert and a coterie of los angeles sessionmen with alpert overdubbing himself on trumpet to get that bullring effect also alpert was just getting the tjb concept underway the textures are leaner the productions less polished and the accent is more consciously on a mexican mariachi ambience — the relatively square rhythms the mandolins the mournful wistful siesta feeling — than the records down the road the hit title track originally a tune called “twinkle star” is a cleverly structured exciting and haunting piece of recordmaking — and its composer sol lake becomes the charter member of alpert‘s team of tjb tunesmiths with several more ethnicflavored numbers in accordance with the newly emerging bossa nova movement alpert does a nice straightforward authentic cover of “desafinado” even departing a bit from the tune with some spare jazzinspired licks and “crawfish” pleasingly adapts the mariachi horn sound to a bossa beat volume  volume  original release date  reissue date  the followup lp to the lonely bull in the great tradition of followups tries to duplicate its appeal right off the bat with another leadoff track featuring bullfight sounds and an authentic bullring tune “the great manolete” alpert is beginning to expand his reach beyond baja california without losing the ambience of “the lonely bull” sharpening his skills as a producer and exploring other moods and rhythms in doing so he comes up with the greatest stripper record this side of david rose “swinger from seville” a mocking version of leonard bernstein‘s “america” to a lively guajira beat in a wild simulated nightclub and covers of ’s standards like “more” and “spanish harlem” he also receives some more haunting contributions from sol lake including the wistful “winds of barcelona” later recorded by wes montgomery and a marvelously produced spanishtinged tone poem “marching through madrid” though released in  this record didn’t really start selling until  when tjb albums were monopolizing the upper reaches of the charts en masse south of the border south of the border original release date  reissue date  herb alpert was still using an array of socal studio allstars as his tijuana brass when south of the border  began to restore the combo’s good name after the modest herb alpert’s tijuana brass vol   failed to ignite a fire in listener’s ears alpert later commented that the sol lake composition “mexican shuffle” “opened a new door for me” that passageway meant the loss of the tijuana brass‘ practically forced mariachi style and the rise of alpert‘s approach in arranging familiar melodies in fresh creative settings nowhere would this stylistic progression be as pronounced as in the horndriven updates of several thenconcurrent chart hits for instance the mod sonic wrinkle in “girl from ipanema” emits a darkness veiled in mystery directly contrasting the light buoyancy of “hello dolly” or the footloose feel of the beatles‘ “all my loving” they seamlessly fit in with sol lake‘s “salud amor y dinero” and a cover of julius wechter‘s playful midtempo “up cherry street” — which wechter‘s own baja marimba band had just recorded for their  selftitled debut the ballads “i’ve grown accustomed to her face” “angelito” and “adios mi corazon” provide contrasts with alpert‘s sensitive scores never seeming maudlin or unnecessarily over the top if the regal “el presidente” sounds particularly familiar it may well be due to alpert‘s slight renovation of the “winds of barcelona” from the tijuana brass‘ previous effort the less than impressive herb alpert’s tijuana brass vol  it was renamed “el presidente” presumably to honor the thenrecent memory of the slain us leader john fitzgerald kennedy whipped cream whipped cream original release date  reissue date  building upon south of the border‘s  top ten success herb alpert dismissed the contingency of los angelesbased studio instrumental allstars which he had christened the tijuana brass because there was enough demand for live dates just like a musical gepetto alpert formed a real tijuana brass the bandleadertrumpeter was joined by tonni kalash trumpet robert edmondson trombone pat senatore bass john pisano guitars lou pagani piano and nick ceroli drums ostensibly the personnel wasn’t a primary consideration as alpert and company had already begun making serious inroads on the pop music scene not bad considering the market was being heavily infiltrated if not practically dominated by the british invasion with whipped cream  other delights  they would take that momentum to new heights — including three grammy awards alone for the update of the bobby scott and ric marlowpenned theme to shelagh delaney’s play of the same name “a taste of honey” the remainder of the material on the dozensong album was chosen with food as the underlying thematic motif sol lake — who provided alpert “the lonely bull” and “mexican shuffle” returns and this time he has custommade the upbeat and above all catchy trio of “green peppers” “bittersweet samba” and “el garbanzo” allen toussaint‘s title composition “whipped cream” garnered significant attention but not as a chart hit rather it could be heard as bachelorettes were being introduced on abctv’s the dating game early in the series run additional alpert offerings were also incorporated as incidental music “spanish flea” as the bachelors were being announced “lollipops and roses” when the lucky winners were being told where they would be spending their date and both “ladyfingers” and “lemon tree” were in rotation as contestants mulled over their answers after several poor analogtocd transfers in the ’s and ’s whipped cream  other delights was reissued as part of shout factory’s herb alpert signature series and boasts remarkably improved sound   going places going places original release date  reissue date  herb alpert  the tijuana brass were rolling right down the middle of the american pop scene like a locomotive in  — and this album captures them at the peak of their exuberance by now there really was a live touring edition of the tijuana brass and there was an easily identifiable tjb sound with its strummed latin american guitars twin trumpet leads delicate marimba or vibes played by julius wechter of baja marimba band fame in the studio and strong grooves rooted in latin american music jazz and rock alpert‘s family of sidemen and composers were busy generating their own catchy hits like wechter‘s deadly infectious “spanish flea” and the tragically shortlived ervan coleman‘s wonderfully goofy “tijuana taxi” the bossman’s trumpet could be joyous mocking and melancholy in turns and his choices of tunes totally unpredictable who else would dare juxtapose “the rd man theme” “walk don’t run” “i’m getting sentimental over you” and “zorba the greek” on one record no other tjb record has as much unbuttoned fun and humor as this one — and not surprisingly it spent six weeks at number one in  what now my love what now my love original release date  reissue date  with this album herb alpert and the tijuana brass settle into their hitmaking groove the once strikingly eclectic elements of dixieland pop rock and mariachi becoming more smoothly integrated within alpert‘s infectious “ameriachi” blend they sound more like a band along with alpert‘s nowindelibly stamped trumpet sound you can recognize jazzman john pisano‘s distinctive rhythm guitar lou pagani‘s piano the droll bob edmondson‘s dulcet trombone etc pisano who debuted as a composer on going places comes up with a memorably whistleable song “so what’s new” and the rest of alpert‘s songwriting brigade ervan coleman julius wechter and sol lake chime in with some lively catchy tunes there is also an assortment of pop film and broadway standards of the day all impeccably arranged by alpert whose production instincts grew sharper and surer with every release the result is another highly entertaining hit lp one that stayed at number one longer than any other tijuana brass album nine weeks sro sro original release date  reissue date  by late  it seemed as if every tv commercial and every pop arranger had latched onto the herb alpert “ameriachi” sound — at which point the resourceful originator of that sound began to pare it down and loosen it up a bit sro standing room only referring to the tijuana brass’ string of soldout concerts is an accurate title for this lp is about a sevenpiece band loaded with experienced jazzers who groove and swing together to a greater degree than on their previous albums sure the arrangements are very tightly knit and don’t allow much room for spontaneity but they still sound fresh and uninhibited and alpert often allows the flavor of jazz to come through more clearly indeed two of the album’s three hit singles “the work song” and “flamingo” are jazz tunes — the former nervous and driving the latter joyously kicking — and the third “mame” gets a nifty dixieland treatment a la louis armstrong with alpert singing one verse the sleeping gem of the record is guitarist john pisano’s “freight train joe” a wistfully evocative tune that won’t quit the memory and the mournful alpertpisanonick ceroli tune “for carlos” later became wes montgomery’s “wind song” though sro only went to number two on the lp charts alpert’s creativity and popularity were still peaking sounds like… sounds like… original release date  reissue date  for one week in june  sounds like was able to break the monkees‘ week hammerlock on the number one slot on the charts — just two weeks before the beatles‘ sgt pepper took over and changed the world this shows lest you forget — and many have — just how popular herb alpert  the tijuana brass were still spanning the generations during the summer of love still putting out records as fresh and musical and downright joyous as this one though not as jazzflavored as sro sounds like does preserve the feeling particularly in the extended vamps on an updated slave song “wade in the water” a hit single “gotta lotta livin’ to do” settles you into the record with nothing but a long vamp — a daring production decision yet alpert was on a roll everything he tried in the tjb‘s heyday seemed to work the lesserknown tunes backloaded on side two are a string of pearls — john pisano‘s appropriately titled bossa nova “the charmer” roger nichols‘ tense “treasure of san miguel” ervan coleman‘s catchy “miss frenchy brown” finally alpert takes a flyer and concludes the lp with an extravagant burt bacharach orchestration of his theme from the film casino royale — an artifact of ’s pop culture to be sure but still a perfectly structured record   herb alpert’s ninth herb alpert’s ninth original release date  reissue date  the cover art of herb alpert’s ninth is hilarious — a bust of grim old beethoven wearing a herb alpert sweatshirt a parody of the pop icon fad going around at the time and maybe a comment on the rock world’s newfound pretensions in the wake of the beatles‘ sgt pepper in any case herb alpert’s ninth does introduce some highbrow pretensions of sorts to alpert‘s ameriachi sound — some very subtly applied strands of strings on several numbers and a madcap multisectioned fantasy of tunes from bizet‘s carmen that is full of injokes from the opera and the tjb‘s hits alpert is also quite aware of the brave new world around him he does a spare lazy yet entirely novelsounding cover version of sgt pepper‘s “with a little help from my friends” and gives the supremes‘ “the happening” a bouncy workout there is also a touching memorial to the late ervan coleman “bud” and another underrated contribution from the alpert songwriting team sol lake‘s swinging “cowboys and indians” the tjb still churns out the latin american rhythms but sometimes with a shade less exuberance   the beat of the brass the beat of the brass original release date  reissue date  meant as the companion album to a herb alpert  the tijuana brass television special of the same name and packaged in a fancy doublefold lp jacket the beat of the brass came out amid signs that alpert‘s hot streak was finally beginning to run out not quite viewer requests for a new burt bacharach song “this guy’s in love with you” — featuring an alpert vocal — were so strong that am released it as a single which shot up to number one and took the beat of the brass with it to the top herb‘s vocal is touching in its strained naïveté he sounds sincere and that overrides the lush overbearing bacharach orchestral arrangement the rest of the album generated an often nostalgic quality then and now the tunes by john pisano and sol lake are exquisite and alpert‘s arrangements of songs like “thanks for the memory” seem autumnal in quality as if an era were about to close the band still has the ability to groove the vamp on julius wechter‘s bossa nova “panama” with wechter‘s jazzy vibes and pisano‘s strong rhythm guitar could have been stretched to half an hour yet alpert‘s trumpet sounds a bit withered at times and the band vocals and cloying children’s chorus on “talk to the animals” could be done without christmas album christmas album original release date  reissue date  herb alpert turned to jazz’s shorty rogers — then toiling in the la film and tv studios — for voice and string arrangements on his christmas album and rogers in turn went all out for schmaltz rogers‘ cooing voices introduce several of the tunes whereupon the tijuana brass do their mostly unrelated ameriachi thing familiar from past albums indeed “las mananitas” seems to have been lifted from an obscure bside of a  and overdubbed with the rogers treatment jingling bells is a recurring song theme — first with “jingle bells” then the cloying “the bell that couldn’t jingle” and ultimately “jingle bell rock” for the first time in a long time alpert‘s sense of pacing occasionally goes awry “my favorite things” nearly comes apart in the silences and pianovocal interlude between the tjb grooves and “sleigh ride” screeches to a dead halt and yet time and further exposure has revealed this record’s homey charms which no doubt is one reason why it continues to be available on cd where other tjb bestsellers have fallen by the wayside   warm warm original release date  reissue date  herb alpert and the tijuana brass shed almost all of the dust of tijuana on this mellow richly textured album one reviewer at the time wrote that alpert seemed to have exchanged bullrings for wedding rings lest one think that the tjb came down with a terminal case of the warm fuzzies though there are some selections here that sizzle — particularly the old standard “the continental” — and in terms of arrangements and song selection the accent falls on brazil more than on any other tjb album shorty rogers again was called in to provide voices and orchestrations but he is more tasteful here than on the christmas album the extreme dynamic range on harry nilsson‘s “without her” notwithstanding a different take of “to wait for love” — the lovely bacharachpenned alpertsung followup to “this guy’s in love with you” from  — is included here as is the fine single “zazueira” yet warm was the first nonseasonal tjb album in some time that couldn’t crack the top  for the brass‘ crossgenerational appeal was fading fast   the brass are comin’ the brass are comin’ original release date  reissue date  the western motif on the doublefold album jacket — with herb alpert and the tijuana brass in costume — signals this as another companion album to a tv special but there is a deeper significance to this lp for shortly after its release a burnedout personally troubled alpert disbanded the brass and retired from music for awhile indeed stretches of this record reveal a tired group and a leader whose trumpet has lost much of its old zip even so as on all tjb albums there are several gems — the stunning shifts in texture and tempo that enliven the wornout “moon river” the chugging bluegrasstinged arrangement of villalobos’ “the little train of the caipira” that masquerades under the name of the title track a haunting rendition of the beatles’ “i’ll be back” the fast samba treatment of “anna” dave grusin and shorty rogers contribute an occasional orchestration and alpert does a modest vocal turn on the lush “you are my life” but this time the old sales magic was gone the tijuana brass had suddenly become unhip in polarized    summer time summer time original release date  reissue date  though herb alpert was technically taking a sabbatical from music in the early s he wasn’t entirely inactive recording in dribs and drabs so am assembled this brief collection of singles and stray cuts in the summer of  it went nowhere on the charts but added some pleasing entries to the alpert discography the two best cuts taken from a  single are as good as anything from the tijuana brass‘ heyday with alpert‘s own haunting tone poem “jerusalem” and a great strutting arrangement of “strike up the band” the title track with a dual vocal by alpert and his wife lani hall is also intriguing drawing inspiration from the famous miles davisgil evans version while alpert pulls off a really good jazz trumpet solo on “the nicest things happen” otherwise most of the tracks on this lp lack energy and even vigorous arrangements like that of the beach boys‘ “darlin” drift off distractedly into the ozone clearly alpert wasn’t quite ready to reemerge fullblown into the performing world you smile – the song begins you smile – the song begins original release date  reissue date  his fouryear sabbatical over herb alpert returned to the studio creatively refreshed his trumpet sounding more soulful and thoughtful his ears attuned more than ever to jazz the name of his studio group has been shortened to just the initials tjb in whose ranks one hears the familiar mallets of julius wechter and the lazy trombone of bob edmondson and the old mexican flavors still come through now and then but alpert was definitely still in a pensive mood and his evocative selfpenned title track and choice of tunes like “alone again naturally” and “save the sunlight” reinforce the lp’s mellow ’s contemporary pop atmosphere even the upbeat remake of the tjb’s “up cherry street” is filtered through a phaseshifted gauze a wistful rosecolored vision of the past left over from a  single is a terrific subtle latinjazztinged arrangement of “last tango in paris” with a distinctive orchestral helping hand from quincy jones coney island coney island original release date  reissue date  encouraged by his comeback album herb alpert assembled a new version of the tjb — including a hotshot second trumpeter bob findley and jazz piano whiz dave frishberg — and hit the studio and road in  yet coney island was a brave nearly complete departure from the old tijuana brass where the jazzers were given carte blanche and the rhythm section encouraged to do more complex things as a signal of independence the new brass tackle chick corea’s “senor mouse” headon where frishberg runs wild and even longtime marimbist julius wechter is affected by the adventurous spirit alpert’s own playing on trumpet and now flugelhorn and piano is a bit freer as well and he goes out on a limb as a composer with the experimental notquitecoherent “carmine” tjb tradition is also served by a loose swinging version of “i have dreamed” and an older legacy pops up in the alpertfrishberg duet on jelly roll morton’s “the crave” but this edition of the brass was shortlived the public didn’t get it and alpert soon moved on to solo projects leaving this sole lp as its legacy   main event main event original release date  reissue date  “let the good times roll” herb alpert seemed to say as he quickly rejoined forces with masekela for a followup lp to their first collaboration earlier that year recording live at the roxy theatre and on am’s soundstage without duplicating anything on their earlier studio album the two horn players alpert on trumpet masekela on flugelhorn are if anything looser and more freewheeling than before though alpert is not on quite as sure a jazz footing as masekela neither musician tries to blow the other out of the room the band containing only one holdover guitarist arthur adams from the first album is more attuned to latin funkjazz with a south african tinge this time again alpert and masekela have mostly fine tunes to work with none better than “foreign natives” and “shame the devil” by african trombonist mosa jonas gwangwa plud henry sithole’s wistfully haunting “mama way” which has chanted vocals and a string quartet this album and its predecessor had the effect of recharging alpert’s music though both are almost forgotten today herb alpert  hugh masekela herb alpert  hugh masekela original release date  reissue date  a mustachioed herb alpert breaks out of his ’s blue funk to fuse himself with fellow horn player hugh masekela and producerpianist caiphus semenya in a magnificent lp of south africanamerican popjazz from the joyous opening strains of the south african oldie “skokiaan” to the haunting groove of “moonza” alpert wholeheartedly melts into masekela‘s distinctive idiom his trumpet a relaxed foil for the south african exile’s blazing flügelhorn but masekela can also lean the other way joining alpert in tjblike dual harmony on “ring bell” the band is mostly a coterie of la sessionmen but they can swing along to the township jive pretty well and they have some excellent musical material mostly by semenya to work with alpert sounds like he’s having more fun making music than he has in a long time rise rise original release date  reissue date  if the ″ single of herb alpert‘s “rise” hadn’t taken over the charts the way it did back in  one wonders if anyone would have gotten around to checking out the tijuana brass or if alpert would have gone down in the books as the guy who had a number one with a burt bacharach tune “this guy’s in love with you” instead the cut energized the entire dance club generation with djs looking for new grooves and it even ended up being used by sean “puffy” combs on the notorious big‘s hypnotise albeit in a drastically remorphed form the single began as a disc track composed by alpert‘s nephew randy and his pal andy armer alpert suggested they slow the groove way down and turn it into a slow mover they issued it without an album to go with it simply as a single on am club djs picked up on it and began using duplicate copies either to let the percussion break go on a bit longer before trumpet kicked in or playing one copy just behind another creating a callandresponse melody with the trumpet and the rhythm section after the single stormed the charts and stayed there all summer eventually hitting the number one spot alpert armer and friends went about assembling an album to capitalize on it they did well rise hit number six on the billboard pop chart the rest of the tracks are a slew of originals and covers the set opens with a small pomp and circumstance intro called “” that alpert composed for the olympics that year assisted by the late michel colombier on keyboards alpert also composed the balladturnedlatindancefloor fire walker “behind the rain” originally composed for gato barbieri‘s caliente album that has its own appeal in the st century with choruslike backing vocals other tracks include the armer and randy alpert “rotation” this cut introduced by hand percussion bells and shakers is another soulful groover with a killer softspoken keyboard line that’s hypnotic lite funk a looped synth line enters in place of a bassline handclaps fingersnaps and alpert‘s distant trumpet play a melody not unlike the one on the “lonely bull” effects washes reverb and mild distortion create a futuristic backdrop to this otherwise beautifully melodic tune alpert plays inthepocket souldrenched melody lines over the top and one of the first “chillout” tunes was born what it all adds up to is an extraordinary recording that stands the test of time as a bona fide classic of the late discopre hiphop era the pop charts would have none of it these days but eating this up as folks did premtv with simply the radio going nuts trying to introduce the next single from it alpert his nephew and armer stumbled onto something that would reinvigorate alpert‘s career as a recording artist and as a producer beyond beyond original release date  reissue date  naturally the wild success of “rise” would lead anyone to the temptation of repeating oneself and at first this followup lp does plenty of that grafting the same slow handclapping beat onto several numbers but alpert won’t sit still for long and he comes through with some startling things that wake up the record midway through the funky percolating party beat of “red hot” starts the engine which is pushed to an electrifying degree by the sequencerdriven echoplexed hardcharging title track where we hear alpert’s distinctive horn through a metallic electronic buffer the most amazing track is the finale “the factory” a terrifying relentlessly grinding depiction of a soulless foundry that must have shocked sedate former tjb fans who bought this album on a lark expecting happy music from the past bold stuff indeed and it did make some impact on the charts though not nearly to the degree of rise magic man magic man original release date  reissue date  the highflying confidence of rise and the experimental bent of beyond began to wear off by  giving way to the more relaxed but musically weaker ministrations of magic man with michael stokes then am’s director of black productar coproducing alpert came up with a pleasant collection of mostly forgettable mildmannered rbpopslanted tunes plus a fairly uneventful renditionatlength of “besame mucho” and a redundant chachadisco remake of his own “you smile the song begins” alpert‘s haunting trumpet still reflects his post“rise” sense of command but he doesn’t have much to say this time the material holds him back   fandango fandango original release date  reissue date  challenged and fired up by some new mexican colleagues herb alpert set out to make a record specifically for the latin american market and ended up producing a masterpiece — the equal of the best tijuana brass albums and in some ways maybe better than any of them fandango has a more authentically latin american sound than the cosmopolitan tjb records using rhythms from mexico to south america adding a coating of strings or synthesizers and alpert’s soaring trumpets more importantly with the help of coproducer jose quintana alpert lined up some incredibly beautiful material from thenlittleknown writers like juan carlos calderon diego verdaguer and roberto carlos some of these tracks are spinechilling in their emotional pull and uncanny sense of structure alpert the master of the studio working at his peak alpert’s magnificent renderings of calderon’s highflying “route ” a top  hit single and aching “margarita” are perfect records you wouldn’t want to change a note he also has a ball with verdaguer’s driving “coco loco” and the concluding track is a fastmoving medley of latin american hits starting with mexico’s “frenesi” and rambling through brazil’s “bahia” and spain’s “moliendo cafe” before riding off with the irresistible venezuelan “porompompero” as much as one hates to limit the horizons of an adventurous musician like herb alpert one must admit that latin influences inspire his best work — and whether working in a latin framework or not he has yet to equal this album   blow your own horn blow your own horn original release date  reissue date  this album is typical of herb alpert‘s ’s style with his familiar horn sound grafted to contemporary dance and rb rhythm tracks he even got the old motown team of hollanddozierholland to write and coproduce a couple of tunes although there is nothing here to rival alpert‘s  comeback “rise” he had multiformat success with the album which charted pop rb and jazz and threw off two chart singles “garden party” and “red hot”   bullish bullish original release date  reissue date  yes herb alpert did indeed record an album in  under the name tijuana brass for the first time in nine years — and in fact he took a tijuana brass contingent on tour that year with four of the original bandmembers on hand but this album has nothing to do with the old tjb for the music is the same hightech pop of the s that alpert had been mostly purveying since “rise” and with synths galore a frantic electronic dance beat on many numbers and none of the original brass on the sessions no wonder for the arranger is john barnes who had worked for the jacksons alpert was no fool the jacksons‘ sound was never hotter about all that remains of the tjb is alpert‘s familiar trumpet which often hearkens back to his ’s manner in this gleaming setting the best moments are the whomping title track the hyperactive “struttin’ on five” and the optimistic “life is my song” but to call this a “tijuana brass” album is bordering on consumer fraud for the faithful — though on its own terms it is a fairly live slice of ’s pop   keep your eye on me keep your eye on me original release date  reissue date  the unbelievable sales success of this record is a testament to herb alpert’s extraordinary ability to keep his ear to the ground — no doubt aided by his position as vicechairman and coowner of am records — and adapt to the times at a time when am’s janet jackson was blazing up the charts alpert journeyed to minneapolis and cut some tracks with jackson’s producers jimmy jam and terry lewis producing the others himself in a mostly similar technopop vein presto three top ten rb singles came out of the album “keep your eye on me” “making love in the rain” and the number one hit “diamonds” the flashy trashy “diamonds” no doubt was aided on its rush up the charts by jackson and lisa keith’s bouncy lead vocals it’s really their record and that of jam and lewis despite alpert’s top billing jackson and keith also take the lead in the simpleminded lyrics of “making love in the rain” which nevertheless has a haunting effect accented by alpert’s muted musings through an electronic gauze at first this seems like a gleaming digital machine of a record loaded with repetitive sampling effects and drum machines churning out that ubiquitous ’s backbeat but the techno stuff gradually gives way to alpert’s humane trumpet which in a touching valentine to the ’s on acker bilk’s “stranger on the shore” is eventually allowed to soar unimpeded over the electronics   north on south st north on south st original release date  reissue date  ever attuned to what is happening out there in recordland herb alpert tried to graft his trumpet onto the rhythms and textures of hiphop and technodance music in north on south st hoping again to crash the rb charts he used four young black coproducers greg smith robert jerald jimmy b and troy staton and they get some festively percolating grooves going on tracks like “passion lady” and “paradise ” clearly alpert’s early jazz leanings were beckoning more strongly and his miles davislike musings over the dance tumult actually anticipated the acidjazz movement later in the decade making this a historically important record yet there is something melancholy about alpert’s playing on this album like a lonely figure from the past looking in on a party from an outside window on the street genuinely wanting to join in but unable to totally connect still for someone of alpert’s age  at the time of release it is amazing that he was willing and able to stay in touch with the cutting edge of contemporary pop   midnight sun midnight sun original release date  reissue date  having recently sold am to polygram for a cool  million and with his short but hugely affecting association with the late stan getz on his mind herb alpert finally took the plunge and recorded what he called a jazz album his last for the label he cofounded but this would not be a conventional blowing session rather it is an intimate inward weesmallhours kind of album where muted and not alpert’s horn sighs laments and sings over a conventional rhythm section and underneath a blanket of lush strings without a doubt miles davis in his introspective ’s mode is herb’s primary inspiration — always has been — and he uses space between the notes in similar ways but always with his own tone and distinct phrasing two old favorites from the tjb days “a taste of honey” and “i’ve grown accustomed to her face” are revisited “taste” is completely transformed into a dark elegy that breaks into the light before turning back to the shadows one track “friends” was left over from  where herb was joined by a luminoussounding getz they really play like intimate friends together this is not a terribly spontaneous album — alpert is too much the master of structure to leave very much to chance — but it creates a mood of melancholy serenity that is difficult to resist anything goes anything goes original release date  reissue date  herb alpert had never really embraced his inner jazzman over the course of an entire album before the closest he came was ’s midnight sun ultimately a highly controlled cocoon of a recording but this at long last is it and it represents a string of firsts for the protean trumpeter — his first truly straightahead jazz project his first allnew album of any kind in ten years his first complete album with his wife singer lani hall who gets cobilling and his first released by a label which he did not coown the concept grew out of a series of live dates that he and hall played in various cities from which these tracks were assembled despite some apparent lightly applied overdubs it remains an intimate small group album of mostly standards the kind of thing one might run across at vibrato — alpert‘s jazz club in the hills above los angeles hall appears in tandem with alpert on nine of the  tracks — with alpert taking five for himself — which guarantees an additional unique layer of intimacy as alpert wraps his pithy horn lovingly around hall‘s voice hall has kept her portuguese in gear doing well by ivan lins‘ “dinorah dinorah” and the rapidfire syllables of “pararaio” she adopts a dark dusky tone on “that old black magic” and for “let’s face the music and dance” she takes on an air of desperation focusing on the words “there may be trouble ahead” still in good shape in his seventies alpert retains the marcato bravado of the tijuana brass days and the more recent terse moody muted tones of a miles acolyte in “it’s only a paper moon” these two personas go mano a mano rather humorously “the trolley song” done at an unusually lazy loping pace by the tijuana brass more than four decades before is taken at a more traditionally quick latinaccented tempo here and this is the third time around for “i’ve grown accustomed to your face” — now a casual vocal showcase for alpert with a witty coda that sneaks in a horn lick from “this guy’s in love with you” the adept backup trio of bill cantos on keyboards — who comes up with a few nifty quotes himself — hussain jiffry on electric bass and michael shapiro on drums and latin percussion goes down agreeably this is a classy welcome return to albummaking for alpert and a good fit for concord’s adultoriented roster   i feel you i feel you original release date  reissue date  trumpeter herb alpert and vocalist and wife lani hall teamed as a duo for the critically acclaimed live recording anything goes in  i feel you is the studio followup to that fine recording and the contrasts between the two are marked while the former album reflected new takes on the jazz canon this one delves into rock pop jazz and brazilian tunes and interprets them with a contemporary international feel without leaving jazz behind backed by their touring group — pianistkeyboardist bill cantos drummerpercussionist michael shapiro and bassist hussain jiffry — alpert and hall commence with a reading of van morrison‘s “moondance” that is as influenced by arabic modalism as it is the nocturnal bopnoir inherent in its melody led by a fretless bassline and shakers alpert runs through the lyric on muted trumpet the pair begins singing together over a minute in as the piano enters the fray and shakers are complemented by hand drums “cast your fate to the wind” is a showcase for hall‘s trademark phrasing and alpert‘s jazzwise improvisation on a caribbeanbased rhythm it’s languid lovely and in its gentle way it pops thanks to the rhythm section other highlights here include the brazilianflavored tunes “there will never be another you” even with alpert‘s reedy vocals “berimbau” “the corner clube’ de esquina” and “viola” hall‘s vocals — which are still in top form — and alpert‘s playing complement one another symbiotically especially on the latter tune the reading of “here comes the sun” is radical it’s doubletimed by shapiro’s snare and painted by cantos‘ rhodes piano with an alternate melody played by jiffry‘s electric bass while alpert and hall hold down the original melody trumpet and vocal in the quiet storm likewise “blackbird” is performed as a funky modern jazz number with smooth samba overtones the african drumming on “what now my love” with alpert‘s clipped and slightly reverbed phrasing on the melody transforms the tune the reading of “call me” which he produced for chris montez in  is reinvented here as a lithe syncopated romantic groover less successful is “fever” because its center isn’t in the vocal or trumpet but in the rhythm section’s interplay that quibble aside i feel you is an excellent contemporary jazz recording by a veteran duo whose intuition is nearly flawless steppin’ out steppin’ out released  trumpeter and pop music icon herb alpert and his wife former brasil ’ vocalist lani hall have recorded and performed together a few times since meeting over  years ago however it wasn’t until  that the duo began touring and performing regularly in  they released the album anything goes which found them interpreting standards and brazilian music they followed that album up with ’s i feel you which continued in the jazz brazilian and latin music vein adding in more contemporary pop songs alpert and hall‘s  release steppin’ out also features a warm collection of songs that hit upon all the stylistic touchstones of their careers from ’s novelty instrumentals to latin music brazilian bossa nova smooth jazz and american popular song standards once again joining alpert and hall here is their touring ensemble featuring pianistkeyboardist bill cantos drummerpercussionist michael shapiro and bassist hussain jiffry steppin’ out also reunites alpert with keyboardist jeff lorber who appeared on alpert‘s  album passion dance and who produced his  album second wind generally speaking steppin’ out is the most stylistically varied of the three alperthall albums moving from an electronicdance reworking of “puttin’ on the ritz” to the atmospheric orchestral ballad “i only have eyes for you” hall‘s poignant interpretation of irving berlin‘s “what’ll i do” a dramatic symphonic take on astor piazzolla‘s  nuevo tango masterpiece “oblivion” and the smooth funk of the alpertlorber original “migration” the album even ends with alpert revisiting his  tijuana brass breakthrough hit “the lonely bull” this time with additional orchestral and electronic flourishes that sound less ’s lounge pad and more contemporary james bond action movie theme accented by alpert‘s miles davisinfluenced soloing ultimately steppin’ out represents not just the third album in a trilogy but a loving creative partnership that for alpert and hall spans a lifetime   in the mood in the mood released  although trumpeter and pop icon herb alpert is largely associated with his jazz latin and lounge instrumentals of the ’s and ’s he’s never fully retired from the music scene in fact alpert‘s  album with wife and vocalist lani hall won a grammy award for best pop instrumental album coming on the heels of that album alpert‘s  effort in the mood finds the stylistically wideranging artist once again bringing together a mix of jazz standards smooth pop instrumentals and infectious original compositions working with his nephew arrangerproducer randy badazz alpert as well as such longtime collaborators as bill conti mike shapiro and jeff lorber alpert has crafted an album that perfectly updates his approach for a modern audience alpert was an early adopter of electronic sounds and in the mood is no exception as it features a very clubready emd reworking of the swingera classic “chattanooga choo choo” it’s an iconoclastic move also echoed in his funky hiphopinflected take on “blue moon” while alpert always seems to be in search of new musical ground to explore he’s conversely never afraid to revisit his past as evidenced by his electronic and contemporary rbinfused arrangement of his old tijuana brass number “spanish harlem” elsewhere alpert teams again with hall for several gorgeous laidback latin numbers including the funky “don’t cry” and the romantic “ am” and it’s not just alpert‘s knack for crafting listenable relaxing pop songs that makes in the mood so enjoyable arguably alpert‘s trumpet playing has only deepened over the years and cuts here like his poignant orchestral reading of “when sunny gets blue” reveal his gift for small group jazz balladry that brings to mind a mix of chet baker and harry sweets edison ultimately whether he’s digging deep into a jazz standard or defying expectations with a breezy electronic arrangement alpert proves yet again he is a true pop journeyman on in the mood   come fly with me come fly with me released  since his  return to regular recording after a tenyear hiatus trumpeter herb alpert has stayed busy releasing albums some with his wife vocalist lani hall and others like ’s come fly with me on his own  years old at the time of this release alpert has gone from instrumental pop icon of the ’s and ’s to journeyman performer with decades of experience to draw from working with a bevy of longtime collaborators including his nephew programmer randy “badazz” alpert bassistguitaristproducer hussain jiffry keyboardistproducer bill cantos keyboardistguitarist jeff lorber alpert has crafted a breezy lowkey collection of originals and cover tunes that nonetheless retains all of the melodic jazzinflected style of his classic recordings although alpert takes on a handful of standards here he approaches them with a creative sense of fun to these ends he reworks the classic sammy cahn and jimmy van heusen title track into a dayglo brazilian bossa nova production similarly on irving berlin‘s “blue skies” alpert‘s supple trumpet is framed by lush orchestral strings that give way to a laidback reggae groove accented by vibratosoaked beatlesesque guitar hits and it’s not just broadway standards that benefit from the alpertization process — the beatles influence pops up again this time with his strippeddown ethereal take on the band’s  classic “something” one of the most interesting and effective transformations here is alpert‘s rb style overhaul of “i’ve got a lot of livin’ to do” from the musical bye bye birdie kicking off with an introspective keyboard figure the song sounds like something along the lines of miles davis covering a yearning ’s soul ballad as with most all of alpert‘s post material come fly with me is a much more lowkey and intimate recording than the productions that marked the best of his ’s tijuana brass period that said by keeping things simple alpert and his collaborators illuminate all of the tenderness and direct lyricism of his horn playing   human nature human nature release date  legendary pop and jazz icon herb alpert continues his prolific career run with his  studio album human nature the album follows up his wellreceived  effort in the mood and picks up on that album’s mix of electronic pop and latininflected danceoriented grooves in his eighties at the time of recording he has aged into a soulful lyrical musician able to bridge the light pop stylings of his youth with more introspective choices human nature finds him completely engaged continuing to explore new sounds and songs joining alpert here are several longtime collaborators in producerpercussionist michael shapiro producerarrangerkeyboardist eduardo del barrio bassistguitarist hussain jiffry keyboardistarrangerproducer bill cantos and others as with alpert‘s other albums since coming out of a tenyear hiatus in  human nature finds the trumpeter applying his distinctively sweettoned sound to a nicely balanced combination of beloved pop standards unexpected covers and originals sometimes as on the title track an inspired brazilian mardi grasinfused reworking of michael jackson‘s “human nature” alpert goes for an inventive crossgenre angle other times as on his lush romantic reading of the burt bacharachelvis costelloballad “look up again” he takes a more straightforward approach framing his yearning miles davis–esque lines with reverbsoaked piano and shimmering orchestral strings alpert even draws upon his iconic tijuana brass doubletracked trumpet sound for a bright electrolatin take on the burt bacharachhal david classic “don’t go breaking my heart” which also features vocals from his wife muse and frequent collaborator lani hall elsewhere alpert strikes a similarly pleasant crossgenre stance with his originals like the discosalsa “shake it” and the sophisticated cocktail hourready latin jazz of “mystery man” ultimately human nature is a warmly produced album by an artist who has seen and done it all and yet still finds magic and mystery in the process facebook twitter   herb alpert presents microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must
