at the national air and space museum since it won the first kremer prize in  gossamer albatross  in  this humanpowered plane flew  miles  km across the english channel and claimed the largest prize in aviation history another of these planes is displayed at the national air and space museum gossamer penguin  a solarpowered variant of the gossamer albatross solar challenger  this plane flew  miles  km from paris france to england on solar power high altitude solar halsolthis solarpowered unmanned aircraft was sponsored by the cia in the s as the first unmanned solarpowered aircraft in history prototyped for national security missions it was declassified and transferred to the ballistic missile defense organization bmdo in  where it was modified as a high altitude long endurance hale uav technology demonstrator capable of becoming weaponized to destroy theater ballistic missiles in the boost phase of flight called boost phase intercept lawrence livermore national laboratory was the executing agent for the bmdo program dr nick colella and dr lowell wood led the llnl efforts for the bmdo program manager ltcol usaf dale tietz ray morgan led the program in aerovironment alongside dr paul maccready and tim conver this was a fastpaced demo program supported at the highest levels of government the ultimate goal was to develop the worlds first fly forever hale uav that could be configured for a variety of national security missions the program was cancelled in  due to budget reductions in the clinton administration at which time the aircraft called pathfinder was transferred to nasa for a new program pathfinder flew several flight test missions at nasas dryden flight research center before the property transfer occurred bmdo and llnl also started initial development of new ultralightweight hypersonic interceptor rockets that could be deployed from pathfinder and its derivatives the interceptor called astrid flew several successful missions during this time period at vandenberg afb ca nasa pathfinder and pathfinder plus  this unmanned plane built by aerovironment as a part of the nasa erast program demonstrated that an airplane could stay aloft for an extended period of time fueled purely by solar power after initial successes the pathfinder was rebuilt into the larger pathfinder plus which is also on display at the national air and space museum dale tietz from the pentagons bmdo program transferred the pathfinder aircraft to nasa for the erast program where aerovironment managed its development as a nonweaponized variant nasa centurion  the centurion was an expansion of the pathfinder concept designed to achieve the erast program goal of sustained flight at  feet  m altitude nasa helios prototype  derived from the centurion this solar cell and fuel cell powered uav set a world record for flight at  feet  m it was intended to be the prototype for the production helios aircraft envisioned as an atmospheric satellite the erast program was terminated in  and as of  helios has not entered production in actuality it has been reborn in the form of the global observer uas currently in development under a joint concept technology demonstration led by ussocom the key technology shift was switching from solar power to liquid hydrogen power aerovironment global observer  the los angeles times reported first flight of global

communications equipment aerovironment owns skytower inc which was formed in  to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude uavs as atmospheric satellites or high altitude communications relay platforms in july  the nasaaerovironment uav pathfinder plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform skytower in partnership with nasa and the japan ministry of telecommunications tested the concept of an atmospheric satellite by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an hdtv signal as well as an imt wireless communications signal from  feet  m giving the aircraft the equivalence of a  miles  km tall transmitter tower because of the aircrafts high lookdown angle the transmission utilized only one watt of power or  of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal according to stuart hindle vice president of strategy  business development for skytower skytower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay further hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere as opposed to actual satellites can achieve much higher levels of frequency use a single skytower platform can provide over  times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band on a bytes

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal
