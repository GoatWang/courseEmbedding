summary reprint ra tjx operates seven brands in the united states canada and europe—including tj maxx marshalls and homegoods—and is the leading retailer of offprice apparel and home fashions in the us and worldwide it operates very differently from traditional retailers each of its stores has a vast number of skus offering customers virtually an entire mall within about  square feet of selling space and to find the right products it sources from more than  vendors around the globe customers expect to have what meyrowitz calls a “treasurehunt shopping experience” when they enter a tjx store the company’s buyers are crucial to providing the merchandise for that experience and its ceo puts a high priority on teaching and developing them they must thoroughly understand consumer and fashion trends and the right value for every product tjx sells they must be opportunistic and extremely flexible and they must develop relationships with the vendors meyrowitz’s longterm vision is to grow tjx revenue from  billion today to  billion and beyond—and that will require many more buyers who are entrepreneurial empowered and teamoriented “they need to be intelligent risk takers” she says “they need to have great instincts and to be comfortable making big decisions” photography jared leeds the idea the retailer’s business relies on hiring buyers who can be flexible and spot opportunities meyrowitz explains how the company is training its next generation fashion runs in my family my father was in wholesale and my mother is an artist my dad was a very good businessperson smart and empathetic i grew up spending a lot of time in his store in new york and i knew early on that business and working with people were my passions before and during college where i majored in marketing and management i was a parttime salesclerk at fortunoff after graduation i joined saks fifth avenue in new york and then went to bamberger’s in  i moved to boston to join first hit or miss a chain of fashion stores that later became part of tjx and then chadwick’s of boston my company’s former catalog division i filled several executive roles at tjx before becoming ceo in  today tjx operates seven retail brands in the united states canada and europe and is the leading retailer of offprice apparel and home fashions in the us and worldwide with  billion in sales in  our businesses offer a treasurehunt shopping experience for great fashions brands and quality merchandise all at amazing prices—that’s how we define value we operate very differently from traditional retailers each of our stores has a vast number of skus offering customers nearly an entire mall within about  square feet of selling space to find the right products we source from more than  vendors around the globe we don’t want to be deep in any one product and we don’t try to carry every size or every style of an item customers come to our stores to find something surprising and special at an outstanding price—what we call the wow factor when they find it they feel compelled to buy it right away because they know that particular item probably won’t be there the next time they visit our merchandise assortments turn over very rapidly one key to driving our business is teaching and developing talent in our buying organization buyers must thoroughly understand consumer and fashion trends and the right value for every product we sell they have to be opportunistic and extremely flexible they have to develop relationships with our vendors which takes a lot of time becoming an outstanding buyer demands curiosity—and a lot of training we have to teach our buyers how to select the right products how to develop advanced negotiation skills and how to communicate with vendors our longterm vision is to grow tjx revenue to  billion and beyond even with more than  merchants in our buying organization to achieve that level of growth we need to expand our base of buyers and develop a larger talent pool in every area of our business room to grow the company believes that the store count of its existing chains in the regions where it currently operates can increase by  over the long term here is a breakdown by division we’ve always been committed to teaching the offprice business to our merchants over the past several years we’ve formalized our teachings in an ambitious training program that we call tjx university which i believe is one of the best training programs in retailing in addition everyone in management spends a great deal of time teaching and mentoring our people for me as ceo it’s an absolute priority yes ceos are responsible for short and longterm strategy to wall street and to their boards but teaching is crucial to reaching our goals creating shareholder value and continuing to drive the longterm success of the company committed to developing talent we hire people for our buyer training program every year many of them right out of college last year we hired more than  new associates and before they completed their training senior management had met every one of them some of their training time is spent in the classroom and some in stores—our own and our competitors’ communication is imperative—we have no walls between departments in our stores and we take the same approach in our organization we want the way we do business—with integrity honesty and caring about one another—to continue to permeate our culture and we speak to this within our program we’ve developed financial training so that associates understand the ramifications of the buying decisions they will make we are all teachers at tjx so experienced buyers serve as mentors to future buyers this oneonone training is vital becoming an outstanding buyer demands curiosity—and a lot of training after associates complete the initial training they spend a substantial amount of time in our planning organization which allocates merchandise to stores there are several additional steps before someone becomes a buyer and our planners and future buyers often move around quickly between departments our retail brands and our locations it’s important that they be exposed to different parts of the business and it’s an advantage that we can move them across divisions both domestically and internationally to gain global experience we teach our future buyers to be entrepreneurial and empowered we want them to feel confident that they can go into the market and seek out the best of the best one day they may buy  items—or they may buy several million units they need to be intelligent risk takers our buyers generally deal with a much broader universe of suppliers than buyers at traditional retailers do they need to have great instincts and to be comfortable making big decisions our model requires them to be very teamoriented let me give you an example not long ago a buyer for a particular product category decided that the offerings that season weren’t very strong so she opted to cut her own budget dramatically and have those dollars allocated to other categories that seemed more likely to drive sales think about that for a moment how many buyers at a traditional retailer would voluntarily cut their own budgets at tjx we reinforce sharing among our buyers by awarding bonuses on the basis of divisional and overall company performance rather than the performance of individual merchandise categories in retailing all buyers are going to make some mistakes—and learning from them is a key part of the training we provide when they make mistakes we want them to go back and examine their merchandise in the stores and evaluate whether it originally felt right from a fashion brand quality and price perspective if something doesn’t sell as well as we would like we mark it down quickly and learn but the buyers must continue to take intelligent risks we all recognize that buyers are part of the heart and soul of the organization it’s an advantage that i and many other people in senior management spent years in that role because our buyers know that and know that we feel passionate about the product they can relate to us we have credibility as teachers i tell them that i was lucky to have a series of important mentors during my career and we encourage them to develop those kinds of relationships we have a casual open culture here i know most of our merchandise managers and our senior executives are very close to our buyers preparing managers for leadership the biggest transition most successful buyers will face is moving from an individual contributor role into a leadership role we do a lot of training to prepare for that transition it can be jarring for someone who has been successful individually to suddenly be responsible for the performance of others and making that work is not necessarily intuitive as their leadership roles change—whether they move on to become merchandise managers or higherlevel executives—we continue to train them to succeed in all our training we emphasize the importance of listening our business is about relationships and you can never have a good relationship if you’re not listening well people who are too closedminded or too linear can have a hard time succeeding as buyers and certainly as managers today many companies are shifting to analytics and trying to use data to scientifically predict what consumers will buy i think that approach can be taken too far i worry that if our company were to become too analytical and our buying process too automated customers would no longer find the exciting and surprising products that create the treasurehunt experience they expect every time they walk into one of our stores as we think about growing our company we know we need to continue to develop and expand our talent pool ahead of our store growth hiring and training are important pieces of our plan to add talent but retention is clearly very important too it’s not unusual in the retail industry for people to move around i believe that one reason we hold on to our best people is tjx’s culture we are very familyfriendly we encourage people to balance work and home life—whatever that means for each individual as a result people tend to stay many of them have been here more than  years as i have teaching is key for longterm success my role as a teacher goes beyond our buyer training program—it’s a part of everything i do whenever i walk into a meeting in any area of our company i’m thinking what can i teach during this meeting often if someone asks me to make a decision or offer feedback rather than announcing my view i’ll ask questions do you see the similarities between this and that if we decide this way what will be the ramifications five or  years from now i try to guide the group to a decision that way as a manager i look for teachable moments every day there is nothing i enjoy more than walking through our stores with a group of buyers creating those moments we talk about categories and products and our shoppers those are my favorite days as a leader a key to our success at tjx is our ability to recruit people who are curious and have tremendous passion whether it’s for merchandising finance store operations logistics human resources information technology real estate marketing or communications as leaders we must make teaching a priority and create an environment in which our associates can grow and learn every day tjx facts  financials founded  headquarters framingham massachusetts employees approximately  as of  tjx employed about  associates worldwide and about  of them were hired in just the previous five years as ceo i’d be very happy if five years from now i could tell you we had hired just as many more ultimately our success now and in the future relies on our associates who bring our business to life every single day for our customers a version of this article appeared in the may  issue of harvard

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
