product line globenewswire may    am edt lindon utah may   globe newswire  profire energy inc otcbbpfie a technology company which manufactures installs and services burner management systems and other combustion management technologies for the oil and gas industry today announced the release of a new burner management system bms named the pf the system is designed to enhance the companys product line by providing fundamental burner management functionality without all the enhanced benefits of the companys flagship pf system we believe the pf fills a gap in the industrys available burner management technology said brenton hatch chief executive officer of profire energy currently the industry is generally offered two products a basic sparkersystem or a fullfeatured burner management system the pf offers a midrange option for customers who dont need the enhanced features of our pf system but still require a safe reignition option with some burner management capabilities the new system will be available beginning in june  with full csaul approvals to current codes once launched the company anticipates the pf will appeal to a smaller market segment than its pf system due to its simplified featureset its worth noting that the pf does not have the versatility or capability of our flagship pf system said patrick fisher lead product designer at profire energy for example the pf provides only basic fueltrain control and does not have the integrated features or expandability of the pf the focused functionality of the pf will however prove a viable option for a specific segment of our customers the system is already installed on select sites in north america and can be purchased by contacting a profire energy representative to learn more about the pf or
