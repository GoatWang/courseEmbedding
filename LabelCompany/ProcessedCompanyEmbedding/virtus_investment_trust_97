persons to follow so that acadian may determine whether access persons are complying with its ethical principles this code of ethics is based upon the principle that the directors officers and other access persons of acadian owe a fiduciary duty to among others the clients of acadian to conduct their affairs including their personal securities transactions in such a manner as to avoid i serving their own personal interests ahead of clients ii taking inappropriate advantage of their position with acadian and iii any actual or potential conflicts of interest or any abuse of their position of trust and responsibility this fiduciary duty includes the duty of the chief compliance officer of acadian to report violations of this code of ethics to acadians executive committee board of directors

our principles and philosophy regarding ethics stress acadians overarching fiduciary duty to its clients and the obligation of its access persons to uphold that fundamental duty in recognition of the trust and confidence placed in acadian by its clients and to give effect to the belief that acadians operations should be directed to benefit its clients acadian has adopted the following general principles to guide the actions of its access persons  the interests of clients are paramount all access persons must conduct themselves and their operations to give maximum effect to this belief by at all times placing the interests of clients before their own  all personal transactions in securities by access persons must be accomplished so as to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest on the part of such access persons with the interests of any client  all access persons must avoid actions or activities that allow or appear to allow a person to profit or benefit from his or her position with respect to a client or that otherwise bring into question the persons independence or judgment  all information concerning the specific security holdings and financial circumstances of any client is strictly confidential access persons are expected to maintain such confidentiality secure such information and disclose it only to other access persons with a need to know that information  all access persons will conduct themselves honestly with integrity and in a professional manner to preserve and protect acadians reputation federal law requires that this code of ethics not only be adopted but that it must also be enforced with reasonable diligence the chief compliance officer will keep records of any violation of the code of ethics and of the actions taken as a result of such violations failure to comply with the code of ethics may result in disciplinary action including monetary penalties and the potential for the termination of employment with acadian in addition noncompliance with the code of ethics has severe ramifications including enforcement actions by regulatory authorities criminal fines civil injunctions and penalties disgorgement of profits and sanctions on your ability to remain employed in any capacity in the investment advisory business or in a related capacity part  scope of the code of ethics a persons covered by the code of ethics acadians operational and investment management practices expose many if not all its employees and contractors to client information including holdings as a result to ensure compliance with

compliance with this duty can be achieved by trying to avoid conflicts of interest and by fully disclosing all material facts concerning any conflict that does arise with respect to any client in addition acadian imposes a higher standard by providing that access persons must try to avoid situations that have even the appearance of conflict or impropriety  conflicts among client interests conflicts of interest may arise where acadian or its access persons have reason to favor the interests of one client over another client eg larger accounts over smaller accounts accounts compensated by performance fees over accounts not so compensated accounts in which access persons have made material personal investments or accounts of close friends or relatives of access persons etc access persons are prohibited from engaging in inappropriate favoritism of one client over another client that would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty  competing with client trades access persons are

the activities a clients investment objectives and the expenses and benefits to the account all trading for a clients account must be undertaken solely in the clients interest g unfair treatment of certain clients visavis others an access person who handles one or more clients may be faced with situations in which it is possible to give preference to certain clients over others access persons must be careful not to give preference to one client over another even if the preferential treatment would benefit acadian or the access person each situation should be examined closely to determine whether the client has consented to the access persons actions favoring another client and whether the resulting relationship with the client that was not favored is fair and consistent with the securities laws if both parts of this test have been satisfied most likely there has been no breach of fiduciary duty c insider trading access persons are prohibited from trading either personally or
