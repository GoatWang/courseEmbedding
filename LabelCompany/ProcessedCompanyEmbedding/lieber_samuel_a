severe punishment combined with solitary confinement start of the stereotypical black and white striped uniforms  8michigan became the first modern jurisdiction to outlaw the death penalty no therefore the juvenile detention centers were created after the war of 8 reformers from boston and new york began a crusade to remove children from jails and instead into juvenile detention centers to separate children from jails which housed men women insane sane people altogether very atrocious conditionsbefore it was created children were punished the same way as adults 8s mentally ill prison reform by dana nickens emily herchenroder and sein an the big questionwhy did people bother to reform prisons and mental institutions causes of the reform dorothea dix  “the sick and insane people are confined in cages closets cellars stalls chained beaten with rods” prisons were overflowing with everyone from murderers to people who simply spitted on street men women children were thrown together in the most unpleasant conditions goals and objectives we need to change who is key goals reform punishment of crimesbetter conditions of jailbetter treatment for mentally illseparate facility for juvenile and adult offenders dorthea dix was a major part of the reformstarted the change and took action firstcreated the first generation of american mental institutions in the usbegan her crusade for humane hospitalsoften toured prisons workhouses and private homes to observe any abusesultimately she gathered five psychiatric hospitals in america dr john galt  invented the talk therapy approachlouis dwight added sabbath schools to jails to educate prisonersfrancis lieber  samuel gridley howe their goals were prison libraries basic literacy for bible reading reduction of whipping and beating commutation of sentences and separation of women children and the sick successes  failiures  limitations do you think children who committed crimes should be treated the same way as adults important events  pennsylvanias eastern state penitentiary 89 a new reformed prison prisoners were physically isolatedevery prison cell had its own exercise yard work area and personal hygiene
