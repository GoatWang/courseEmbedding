statement of facts  i    overview     cindy clapp worked at the cordero mine for nearly  years and was consistently recognized as an excellent equipment operator and a leader among her peers tr       in  clapp began to experience conflicts with her supervisors for the first time after gerald fischer and dave robinson became her supervisors g ex  r ex  tr   unlike previous supervisors fischer and robinson were dismissive and hostile when crew members raised safety concerns tr     as her coworkers became afraid to voice safety concerns they turned to clapp id tr    clapp in turn became more outspoken and became a target of her supervisors hostility tr        in march of  fischer and robinson announced a new directive that ton haul trucks loaded with coal would be turned around in the dark narrow coal pit and dumped if they registered as overloaded tr    clapp believed that this practice was very unsafe and expressed her safety concerns to a number of individuals at the mine including senior management tr      this activity evoked further hostility from fischer and robinson who admonished clapp for going above their heads tr  g ex a p  on march   clapp was discharged purportedly for insubordination r ex  ii    the cordero mine and clapps employment history     the cordero mine is a large openpit surface coal mine located near gillette wyoming tr  the mine uses a truck and shovel method to remove coal tr   surface dirt is drilled blasted and then removed by drag lines to expose the coal seam tr  large excavating machines known as shovels are then used to dig out the coal and load it into ton haul trucks that transport it to hoppers for processing tr  the mine uses smaller support equipment such as track dozers blades scrapers and rubber tire dozers rtds to build and maintain roads and ramps and to clean up loose material in working areas tr        shovels operate in pits known as coal slots or runs where coal has been removed and the coal face is advanced by mining tr   vehicles enter and exit the slot via ramps from the main haulage roads tr  the slot is bordered by a highwall and a low wall tr  the highwall can reach up to  feet in height and is adjacent to the coal face where the haul trucks are loaded by the shovel tr   the grade of the terrain in the pit follows the coal seam and the floor can be uneven steep and soft tr        the coal slots are often wet and narrow with limited room for maneuver by the various vehicles that must access the slot tr    during the night shift the pit area is unlit and the sole illumination comes from the operating vehicles themselves tr      shovel operators are responsible for coordinating the production process in their pit and are integral to ensuring safe operations tr   from their position at the coal face the shovel operators continuously monitor changing conditions and safety hazards on the highwall and in the slot tr  the main method of communication in the pit is by radio and shovel operators are in constant radio communication with dispatchers support equipment operators haul truck drivers and crew supervisors tr      clapp began her career at cordero in  as a haul truck driver tr  she then operated support equipment including blades and dozers before becoming a shovel operator in  tr  clapp was lauded by her coworkers and supervisors as an excellent shovel operator who set the standard for others to follow tr       at the request of management clapp served on various committees at the mine including the enhanced shovel training committee which created a training book for shovel operators and the tritronics troubleshooting team which helped to solve problems with the mines first electronic data collection system tr  clapp had an exemplary attendance record was never late to work and never had a losttime injury in her year career at the mine r exs  tr      the mine has four production crews a through d tr  clapp was a member of the d crew tr  the crews rotate between day shifts and night shifts with time off in between day shifts begin at  am and end at  pm and night shifts begin at  pm and end at  am each crew is supervised by a lead and a rotating operations supervisor ros tr  each ros reports to production manager kyle colby and colby reports to mine manager joe vaccari id tr   gerald fischer became the ros on the d crew in  tr  dave robinson became the lead on the d crew in april  tr   back to top iii    communication of safety concerns is stifled under supervisors fischer and robinson     after fischer and robinson became a management team in  members of the d crew became increasingly uncomfortable raising safety concerns tr   unlike previous supervisors fischer and robinson were dismissive and hostile when miners reported safety concerns tr     as a leader on her crew clapp became more vocal as her coworkers became afraid to raise safety matters for fear of repercussions from fischer and robinson tr    as a result clapp came to bear the brunt of her supervisors hostility as demonstrated by the following incidents     at the end of the shift on november   fischer and robinson sent a flatbed pickup truck to retrieve the seven crew members who were working on clapps run tr   the pickup had only six seatbelts tr  rather than leave a crew member in the pit in november at shifts end clapp drove the truck at a slow speed and took responsibility for riding without a seatbelt tr  on route a lunchbox fell out of the pickup and was run over by a passing truck tr      clapp spoke with fischer and robinson about the fact that they sent a pickup with insufficient seatbelts and also asked for reimbursement for the lunchbox tr   they declined to address the issue tr  the next shift clapp told d crew haul truck driver fallon halverson in the locker room that she was going to raise the incident with vaccari tr       later that day halversons truck broke down and she was told to wait in the lead pickup truck for a ride tr  the lead pickup was parked outside vaccaris office tr  when fischer and robinson came out of the building they were angry and fischer said that bitch well show her whos boss how dare she go over our heads i cant believe she did this to us and said anything to joe tr   halverson felt very uncomfortable and assumed that fischer was talking about clapp because earlier in the day clapp had told halverson that she was going to talk to vaccari about the seatbelt incident id     fischer issued clapp a last and final warning for failing to wear a seatbelt indicating that any future disciplinary incidents could result in termination r ex  although the warning was purportedly necessary pursuant to existing mine policy there was no written documentation of the policy and fischer had not enforced the policy against another miner who was not wearing a seatbelt tr        clapp raised numerous other safety concerns in early  clapp complained repeatedly to fischer and robinson that an unmanned rtd had been parked behind her shovel a practice she believed was unsafe tr  fischer and robinson responded that they did not care because they did not believe the practice was unsafe tr      clapp and others had safety concerns about gps monitor screens that were placed in the cabs of equipment beginning in early  shortly after the screens were installed in the rtds two operators complained to clapp that the screens were impairing their vision tr  clapp and the other operators raised this concern to fischer but fischer responded that the screens would not be moved tr      although clapp normally ran the same shovel every day in march of  clapp was assigned to run a different shovel clapp complained that the screens placement impaired her vision and requested that the screen be moved tr  g ex  on july   clapp was again assigned this shovel but the screen had not been moved tr   g ex  clapp called robinson and informed him that she was going to adjust the screen tr  clapp was unable however to move the screen without blocking the control panel tr  therefore clapp decided to do something she had done previously under a different supervisor she left the screen plugged in and fully operational but removed it from its bracket and placed it on a pad of clean flannel rags behind the shovel seat tr  clapp asked the utility person to inform fischer and robinson that she had moved the screen tr      later that shift fischer and robinson came into clapps shovel and fischer began yelling at clapp for moving the screen tr  fischer and robinson then took clapp back to the office where fischer yelled at clapp that he did not care that clapp had problems with the screen tr  fischer also threatened that he could make clapp work in uncomfortable situations such as placing her in a track dozer on top of a highwall and that she would have to do that work even if she felt it was unsafe tr  clapp told fischer and robinson that she needed to have full vision in her shovel for safety fischer and robinson responded that there was nothing they could do about the monitors and she should get used to it tr  at the end of this meeting which lasted an hour clapp felt demeaned shocked and scared for the safety of her crew because her safety concerns were not being addressed id     fischer and robinson were also unresponsive and hostile towards clapp when she requested water to control dust that was impairing visibility in the run throughout  and early  clapps requests for water were repeatedly ignored tr  other employees on the crew called clapp to ask her to call fischer and robinson to request water because their requests had been ignored and they did not want to risk angering fischer and robinson by continuing to call tr  on one occasion d crew member cindy miller was sitting in the back of fischer and robinsons pickup and heard robinson say to fischer in reference to clapp i dont care how many times she calls she is not getting a water truck tr      on april   clapp received a second last and final warning from fischer after she pushed a stuck haul truck out from under the highwall tr  r ex  before pushing the truck out clapp called robinson to inform him that she was going to push the truck and robinson gave her tacit approval to do so tr  during the process the mounting ladder on the truck broke causing  worth of damage tr   as a result clapp was suspended without pay for two days and lost quarterly performance pay tr  r ex  this discipline came on the heels of clapps complaints to fischer and robinson about monitors impairing visibility and the unmanned rtds in contrast other miners who caused greater property damage were not given last and final warnings see alj dec   back to top iv    clapp raises safety concerns about dumping loaded haul trucks in the coal face and is discharged     beginning in late  and early  cordero added a payload monitoring plm system to the haul trucks tr  the plm is a scale that calculates the weight of the load id tr  the plm does not register a weight reading until the truck has traveled  feet after being loaded tr      in the spring of  fischer and robinson told the d crew that eventually the haul trucks would be equipped with speed governors that would reduce a trucks speed to five miles per hour if it weighed overloaded tr  according to clapps testimony the company was having problems with the accuracy of the scales so fischer and robinson asked the crew to report any trucks with plm systems that were registering inaccurate weights tr  thereafter clapp testified that shovel operators on the d crew called fischer and robinson over the radio whenever they had a truck that was reading inaccurately tr  clapp testified that fischer and robinson subsequently told the shovel operators to stop reporting inaccuracies so the misreading trucks were no longer reported even though the inaccuracies persisted tr  g ex a p      the next time the d crew heard anything else about the governors was on march   during the fiveminute preshift meeting before the start of a night shift tr  at that meeting robinson told the crew that the governors had been installed and that if the governor was triggered after a truck left the loading area the truck should be turned around and dumped back at the coal face tr  robinson also acknowledged that the plm weight system was experiencing difficulties and told the crew to inform him of any trucks that were reading overloaded and then to lightload those trucks to avoid engaging the governor until the truck could be recalibrated tr   robinson told the crew that if they had a problem with his instructions they could take it to colin marshall tr   colin marshall is the ceo of cloud peak energy corderos parent company id     later that night the governor engaged on a haul truck driven by vic young young called clapp and told her he did not know what to do tr  at the time two other coal shovels had recently broken down and seven empty trucks would soon be entering clapps run tr  clapp told young that she did not want the truck dumped at the face and that he should take it to the hopper tr  halverson overheard the discussion and told clapp and young that the drivers had been directed in the preshift meeting to turn the trucks around and dump them if the governor engaged tr  clapp told young to park his truck while she called robinson over the minewide radio tr      when robinson answered clapp told him that youngs truck was overloaded and that she did not want to dump it at the face clapp asked robinson if she could let young proceed to the hopper tr  turning loaded coal trucks around and dumping them in the pit instead of at the hopper was a new task for which miners had not been trained  tr     alj dec  clapp believed that turning a loaded coal truck around in the slot and dumping it in the face was dangerous because the coal slot is a narrow congested area that is dark on the night shift and because the terrain at the coal face is uneven and steep with soft spots which could cause a truck to tip over tr  clapps concerns were echoed by numerous other miners tr    artz  stephens   miller   whitted and  halverson     robinson told clapp to dump the truck at the face tr  clapp told robinson that she believed it was stupid and unsafe to turn the truck around and dump it in the face because of the traffic in the slot but she complied with his directive and instructed young to dump his load id tr  r ex  clapp instructed young to wait to dump until she had finished maintaining the highwall and cleared the other trucks from her run in order to minimize exposure to the highwall during the dump tr      after her shift clapp approached mine manager vaccari in the hallway and told him her safety concerns about the truck dumping procedure tr  clapp told vaccari that she thought it was unsafe to turn around and dump loaded coal trucks in the pit because of the uneven floor tr   vaccari told clapp that he would look into the issue tr  during the discussion clapp saw robinson and then fischer step out into the hallway and give her angry looks behind vaccaris back tr      after she returned home on march  clapp decided to call ros terry oistad a longtenured miner who was working the day shift to discuss her concerns about the dumping procedure tr  clapp told oistad that she was afraid to turn trucks around and have them raise their beds in the congested coal slot id oistad told her that his crew did not always turn trucks around and dump them at the face when the governor engaged particularly if conditions in the pit were not favorable for dumping tr      the d crew was off from march  until march  when they returned for day shifts tr  late into that shift the governor engaged on driver helen clarks truck tr  clark called clapp over the radio and asked what she should do id clapp told clark that clark would have to dump the truck at the face because vaccari had not gotten back to clapp and nothing had changed tr  clapp also suggested that clark could call fischer and robinson who had just entered the run id     upon hearing clapps comments fischer began yelling at clapp over the radio id fischer said that he did not care what vaccari had to say because this was fischers policy not vaccaris policy and clapp had better turn the truck around and dump it at the coal face id clapp followed fischers directive and backed her shovel up so that clark could dump in a better spot id  back to top     the next morning at the start of shift robinson asked clapp to meet with him and fischer tr  given her experience in july of  when robinson and fischer took clapp into a meeting in their office and yelled at and threatened her clapp decided to surreptitiously record the meeting by placing a digital recorder in her pocket  tr      the meeting was long and heated robinson and fischer began the meeting by telling clapp that they were angry that she had gone to vaccari and oistad with her concerns about the dumping directive g ex a pp  clapp explained that robinson had told the crew that if they had a problem with the policy they should take it to colin marshall a statement clapp interpreted to mean that robinson did not want to talk about the policy id at  clapp explained that she felt that communication is one of the most important aspects of safety and that she raised concerns to oistad and vaccari to facilitate communication id at      after clapp cited the july  meeting as an example of her ongoing difficulty in communicating safety concerns fischer again said that he was not afraid to make clapp work in an uncomfortable situation out in the mine id at  fischer also told clapp that you throw a lot of bullshit around and said i dont give a shit if youve got  years of experience id at      at robinsons request hr representative kirk babcock joined the meeting id at  babcock further admonished clapp that questioning the policy over the radio and going outside the crew with her concerns was improper and undermined her supervisors authority id at  clapp expressed dismay that she was being reprimanded for communicating her safety concerns and noted that many others had been complaining about the policy and driving trucks to the hopper after the governor engaged yet she was the only person being reprimanded id at  see also alj dec  other miners took trucks to the hopper after the governor engaged and were not disciplined     at this point clapp took a restroom break id at  when clapp returned she was told that fischer robinson and babcock needed more time to talk privately tr  while she waited clapp went to the safety department tr  at the time safety representative josh tompkins was meeting with d crew driver and safety training team member michelle whitted tr  clapp and whitted spoke to tompkins about the dumping procedure as well as a safety incentive game currently going on at the mine tr      when clapp was called back to the meeting babcock told her that management was concerned about her ability to follow the chain of command and communicate her concerns to fischer and robinson g ex a p  babcock said that because emotions were running high they had decided to send her home for the day with pay id babcock said you can take the day think about it and then come in tomorrow ready to go well finish up the conversation tomorrow and then you know and go from there but the bottom line is that�any concerns have to go through robinson and fischer okay id at  clapp affirmatively acknowledged the need to communicate through robinson and fischer id at  clapp explained again that she had gone to vaccari and oistad only because of robinsons comment and that there had been no attempt to undermine her supervisors only a breakdown in communication id     after the meeting clapp returned to tompkinss office tr  clapp felt scared for the safety of her crew because fischer and robinson were attempting to stifle communication on safety issues tr  seeing clapp very upset tompkins told her that she needed to talk to somebody and handed her a piece of paper with his number and the numbers for hr and vaccari tr      clapp could not sleep that night after the meeting with robinson fischer and babcock because she was concerned that robinson and fischer made it impossible to discuss safety issues on the d crew tr  at about  am on march  clapp called vaccari at home tr  clapp told vaccari that she had serious concerns about issues at the mine and made an appointment to speak with him at the beginning of her sevenday break on march  tr  clapp also told vaccari that she had been up all night because of her concerns and did not feel that she should come to work and was going to take a floating holiday floater vaccari said i understand tr        after calling vaccari clapp called robinson and told him that she was taking a floater tr  robinson asked her if she was sick and clapp responded no im taking a floater robinson handed the phone to fischer clapp told fischer that she was taking a floater fischer responded you cant we got meetings tr  clapp responded that she did not know that they had meetings and she was taking a floater fischer then said okay fine and hung up id     fischer then went to hr manager amy clemetson and told her that clapp had not shown up for a meeting tr  clemetson called clapps home at  am and left a message on clapps answering machine directing clapp to report to the mine site for a meeting by  am tr   after clapp spoke with fischer she went to bed and slept the rest of the day tr  clapp checked her messages that day but did not receive a call or message from clemetson id tr   back to top     later on march  fischer learned that clapp had a meeting scheduled with vaccari the next day tr  clemetson informed vaccari that clapp had missed the meeting scheduled for that morning tr  vaccari told fischer that clapp had told vaccari she was taking the day off and that vaccari had said he understood tr      that afternoon vaccari clemetson babcock colby fischer and robinson met to discuss clapp tr  vaccari decided that no disciplinary decision would be made until after he met with clapp on march  and the group had a few days to think things over tr        toward the end of the day on march  clapp spoke with whitted whitted agreed to go with clapp to meet with vaccari the next day tr   the two wanted to talk to vaccari about the issues they raised with safety representative tompkins tr       on march  clapp and whitted met with vaccari clapp reiterated her safety concerns about turning loaded coal trucks in the run and dumping them at the face tr  r ex  clapp told vaccari that robinson and fischer were angry with her for expressing her safety concerns to vaccari and oistad tr   whitted and clapp also complained about the safety incentive game which they believed fischer and robinson were manipulating whitted and clapp expressed their concern that fischer and robinson discouraged and intimidated employees who raised safety concerns tr        on march  vaccari clemetson colby babcock fischer and robinson met and recommended that clapp be discharged for insubordination tr       vaccari hr and colby made the actual decision to discharge clapp and the decision was reviewed by a corporate compliance committee tr       the individuals involved in the discharge decision gave varying explanations of the insubordination that purportedly formed the reason for clapps discharge colby fischer and robinson purportedly recommended discharge solely because clapp had not shown up at work on march  tr     babcock in contrast purportedly recommended discharge because clapp attempted to send overloaded trucks to the hopper challenged robinson over the radio regarding the dumping procedure went to another supervisor with her concerns failed to acknowledge that fischer and robinson were her supervisors on march  and failed to show up for the march  meeting tr  clemetson purportedly supported the discharge recommendation because clapp disregarded the instructions of her supervisor to dump at the face and failed to show up on march  tr  vaccari purportedly recommended discharge for insubordination based on clapps full record because clapp allegedly refused to listen to her supervisor and failed to show up on march  tr      on march  clemetson called clapp and left a message on her answering machine the message informed clapp that clemetson colby and fischer wanted to meet with her at  pm and asked clapp to call back to confirm that she received the message tr   clemetson asked clapp to call back on march  because she heard

arrived at the meeting clemetson handed her a discharge letter and told her she was terminated tr  the discharge letter stated the reason for this termination is due to your insubordination towards leadership and for other legitimate business reasons r ex      that evening clapp called whitted and told her that she had been discharged tr  on march  whitted was pulled into a meeting with fischer robinson and a member of the utility department whitted was told that cordero was revoking her crew training position that they no longer had a working relationship and that whitted had lied to vaccari about the safety incentive game tr   whitted was in tears and told the others that she was thankful that she still had her job because she was scared they would discharge her too tr  v    decision of the alj     on december   the alj issued his decision finding that clapp was discharged in retaliation for making protected safety complaints and that cordero failed to demonstrate that clapp would have been discharged if she had not made those complaints alj dec  the alj awarded clapp back pay from the date of her discharge until the start of her economic reinstatement on june   id at  the alj found that cordero failed to meet its burden to show that clapp failed to mitigate her damages because clapp searched for work throughout the back pay period and did not limit her search

  back to top summary of the argument     the decision below should be affirmed because substantial evidence supports the aljs finding of discrimination and the alj acted within his discretion in awarding full back pay and assessing a civil penalty     substantial evidence supports the aljs finding that the secretary established a strong prima facie case of discrimination clapp engaged in repeated protected activity when she raised safety concerns about the dumping directive between march  and march   substantial evidence also supports the aljs finding that clapps discharge on march  was motivated by her safety complaints based on the timing of the discharge managements knowledge of clapps complaints clapps supervisors ongoing hostility towards safety complaints and corderos disparate treatment of clapp as compared to miners who did not raise safety concerns     substantial evidence also supports the aljs finding that clapp would not have been discharged in the absence of her protected activity although clapp was purportedly discharged for insubordination each of the purported instances of insubordination cited by cordero was not credible was not in fact relied upon or was itself protected activity furthermore the fact that cordero has offered multiple conflicting explanations for the discharge and is unable to justify the discharge decision without reference to clapps protected safety complaints fatally undermines its argument that clapp would have been discharged in the absence of those complaints     the alj acted within his discretion in awarding full back pay and assessing a penalty of  full back pay was appropriate because cordero failed to meet its burden to show that clapp failed to mitigate her damages to the contrary the alj found that clapp searched for work during the back pay period and was simply unsuccessful under difficult circumstances the aljs penalty assessment was also a proper exercise of discretion because the alj analyzed each of the statutory penalty criteria and found that a substantial increase in the penalty was warranted by the severe chilling effect that clapps discharge had on the willingness of other miners to raise safety concerns argument i    substantial evidence supports the aljs finding that cordero discriminatorily discharged clapp in violation of � c a    standard of review     the aljs findings of

she made protected safety complaints about the dumping procedure and her discharge was motivated by those complaints     protected activity     substantial evidence supports the aljs findings that each of clapps complaints about the dumping procedure was related to safety  on march   clapp called the procedure stupid and unsafe before complying with supervisor robinsons directive and dumping driver youngs truck  tr   clapp also made a safetyrelated complaint at the end of the march  shift when she told mine manager vaccari that she thought it was unsafe to turn around and dump loaded coal trucks in the uneven pit tr   clapp made a safetyrelated complaint again on march  when she called supervisor oistad and expressed her safety concerns about the dumping procedure tr    clapp made additional safetyrelated complaints during the heated meeting on march  when she told fischer robinson and babcock that she had the right to call oistad vaccari and the safety department with her safety concerns about the dumping procedure and reiterated her concerns that the procedure was dangerous g ex a pp         finally clapp made protected safety complaints when she and driver whitted met with vaccari on march  both clapp and whitted testified that clapp raised safety concerns about dumping at the face and that clapp and whitted complained that fischer and robinson discouraged and intimidated employees who raised safety concerns tr   this testimony is corroborated by vaccaris own notes taken contemporaneously during the meeting which mention the dumping policy and state that fischer intimidated clapp and accused her of using safety to get her way r ex  when asked what his notes meant vaccari first said that he could not recall but then stated that they reflected comments made by clapp tr  the alj credited the mutually corroborative testimony of clapp and whitted as further corroborated by vaccaris notes in finding that clapp made safety complaints during the march  meeting alj dec  n     corderos counterargument applies the wrong legal standard cordero argues that the alj failed to establish that clapp reasonably and in good faith believed that she would be required to work in hazardous conditions petrs br  citing gilbert v fmshrc  fd   dc cir  the reasonable good faith requirement is only applicable however when the miner has refused to perform work she

although clapp questioned the practice on march  and stated that she did not want to dump driver youngs truck she complied with the directive after robinson instructed her to dump the truck tr   similarly when the governor engaged on driver clarks truck on march  clapp told clark that she would have to dump because vaccari had not gotten back to clapp and that alternately clark could call robinson to ask him what to do tr  because clapp never refused to perform the dumping procedure her complaints were protected so long as they were related to safety pero  fmshrc at  n gabossi  fmshrc at  knotts  fmshrc at  carmichael  fmshrc at  n     cordero makes a number of other arguments as to why clapps complaints about the dumping procedure were unprotected first cordero argues that clapps complaints were unprotected because clapp was motivated by concerns about productivity or by personality conflicts with her supervisors rather than by concerns about safety petrs br   that argument should be rejected because the fact that clapps concerns about the practice related both to safety and to productivity or other concerns does not make them unprotected the test is simply whether the complaints are related to safety see knotts  fmshrc at  miners statements protected because they included complaints about unsafe equipment at the mine even though miner also raised production and morale concerns during the same conversation gabossi  fmshrc  miners complaints about lack of coordination between production and maintenance departments protected because miner was concerned that lack of communication jeopardized safety     cordero also argues that clapps complaints were unprotected because clapp had the ability to ensure that any hazards were addressed and the trucks were eventually dumped safely thus cordero argues the practice was not objectively dangerous petrs br  however whether the conditions were objectively unsafe is not determinative of the protected status of the complaints mcgill  fmshrc at  rather the complaints are protected so long as they are related to safety     cordero makes a series of arguments to the effect that clapps complaints were unprotected because she failed to consistently and adequately articulate why she believed the practice to be unsafe  petrs br   those arguments fail because the act does not require that complaints contain explicit statements about specific safety or health hazards in order to be protected so long as the complaints are reasonably related to safety pero  fmshrc at  n     finally cordero suggests that clapps comment that the practice was stupid and unsafe was an unacceptable way to question the directive and was therefore unprotected petrs br  yet as corderos brief explains the rights granted under � c may permit some leeway for impulsive behavior which must be balanced against the employers right to maintain order and respect id citing secy of labor ex rel bernardyn v reading anthracite co  fmshrc        clapps statement that the policy was stupid and unsafe simply does not rise to the level required to take such impulsive behavior outside the protection of the act for example in bernardyn the case cited by cordero the commission found that the employer failed to establish that it was justified in terminating a miner who referred to his supervisor as a little fer over the company radio because the comment was made in the context of a safety complaint secy of labor ex rel bernardyn v reading anthracite co  fmshrc    applying the same rule this court upheld an nlrb

placard coors container co v nlrb  fd   th cir  in comparison to those outbursts neither of which was found to forfeit the statutes protection clapps statement that the policy was stupid and unsafe was mild indeed     in sum substantial evidence supports the aljs finding that clapp made repeated complaints about the dumping policy between march  and march  and that these complaints were protected because they were related to safety  back to top     motivation     overwhelming evidence also supports the aljs finding that the secretary established the second element of the prima facie case that clapps discharge was motivated in any part by her protected activity pasula  fmshrc at  recognizing that direct evidence of motivation is rarely encountered the commission has identified four primary indicia of discriminatory intent  knowledge of the protected activity  coincidence in time between the protected activity and the adverse action  hostility or animus toward the protected activity and  disparate treatment of the complainant chacon  fmshrc at  the alj properly found discrimination on the basis of each of the four indicia     first it is undisputed that the supervisors managers and hr personnel involved in clapps discharge decision had direct knowledge of her safety complaints about the dumping directive on march     and  alj dec  second the temporal proximity between clapps protected safety complaints on march  and her discharge on march  provides additional evidence of improper motivation see eg stafford constr  fd   two weeks between protected activity and miners discharge is itself evidence of illicit motive     third the record contains ample evidence of strong and ongoing hostility toward clapps protected safety complaints beginning in  when fischer and robinson became a management team on the d crew in november of  fischer referred to clapp as a bitch for complaining to vaccari about insufficient seatbelts in a pickup truck tr   thereafter clapp was given a last and final warning for riding without a seatbelt despite the fact that the purported seat belt policy was not enforced against another miner tr         in early  clapp and two other miners raised safety concerns about the placement of monitor screens in rtds and these concerns were dismissed by fischer and robinson tr    although robinson testified that no other miners raised concerns about the screen placement in the rtds the alj discredited that testimony based on demeanor the generality of robinsons testimony and the specificity of clapps testimony to the contrary tr  alj dec  see webco indus  fd at  the aljs credibility resolutions deserve great weight to the extent they are based on testimonial evidence of live witnesses and the hearing judge has had the opportunity to observe their demeanor     on july   after clapp moved the screen that was blocking her vision in the shovel fischer began yelling at her and later threatened that he could make her work in an uncomfortable situation tr   robinson also chastised clapp for making safety complaints to other managers by telling her that she made her direct supervisors look stupid by going behind their backs and by using the safety trump to get her way tr  the alj found that these threats constituted unlawful interference with clapps right to make safetyrelated complaints and that such interference constituted background evidence of animus alj dec  see also buckeye elec co  nlrb   n  threat of more onerous working conditions is evidence of animus cordero argues that the finding of interference was inappropriate because the incidents were timebarred but the aljs decision makes clear that he did not consider the threats as substantive acts of discrimination and instead merely considered them as background evidence of animus petrs br  alj dec      a further expression of animus occurred in the summer of  when clapp called for water because of dusty conditions and robinson said i dont care how many times she calls she is not getting a water truck tr  in addition throughout  and early  fischer and robinson repeatedly ignored clapps requests for water forcing clapp to shut down the run in order to get water tr  although robinson could not recall clapp ever shutting down a run because it was too dusty the alj credited clapps specific recollection confirmed on crossexamination over robinsons purported lack of recollection alj dec  n tr   the alj drew a further inference of animus from the events of january  when fischer and robinson continued to dismiss clapps ongoing safety concerns about unmanned rtds parked behind her shovel tr      finally fischer and robinson demonstrated strong hostility towards clapps safety complaints about the dumping policy in march of  when clapp raised her concerns to vaccari in the hallway after the march  shift fischer and robinson gave her angry looks behind vaccaris back tr  on march  when clapp told clark that vaccari had not gotten back to clapp about her concerns fischer began yelling at clapp over the radio tr    during the march  meeting fischer and robinson told clapp that they were angry with her for going to vaccari and oistad with her concerns about the dumping policy and for questioning the dumping policy over the radio g ex a pp  fischer again told clapp that he was not afraid to put her in an uncomfortable situation id at  he further told her you throw a lot of bullshit around and i dont give a shit if youve got  years of experience id at  when babcock joined the meeting he also reprimanded clapp for raising her concerns over the radio and to vaccari and oistad id at      finally the alj found several instances of disparate treatment of clapp with regard to the statements by babcock and clemetson that clapp was discharged for questioning the dumping directive and attempting to send a truck to the hopper the alj found that d crew drivers artz and young actually drove trucks to the hopper after the governor engaged and that management was aware of their actions yet neither driver received any discipline alj dec  tr        with regard to clapps discharge for alleged insubordination the alj noted that d crew operator bob eisenhauer told robinson over the radio on june   dont tell me what to do after robinson told him to be careful and watch what he was doing to avoid equipment damage tr   eisenhauer did not receive any discipline for insubordination cordero argues that the alj erred in finding disparate treatment here because eisenhauers insubordination cannot be compared to that of clapp who purportedly took a floater without permission petrs br  however to the extent that one of the purported reasons for clapps discharge was her criticizing the dumping directive over the radio corderos failure to discipline eisenhauer for showing disregard for his supervisors instructions over the radio is an example of another miner committing the same or more serious offense and yet escaping discipline chacon  fmshrc at      the alj also found evidence that clapp was treated more harshly than other miners when she was issued a last and final warning for causing  of property damage in april of  the alj found that doug christiansen received a mere verbal warning for damaging a very expensive electrical cable and that eisenhauer received a single warning for two incidents of property damage tr   g ex  tr   g exs  and  cordero asserts that christiansens lesser discipline was appropriate because it was his first disciplinary infraction at the mine but that assertion is belied by a subsequent incident report which indicates that christiansen had two to three incidents per year petrs br  g ex  cordero also asserts that eisenhauer was actually disciplined more harshly than clapp because he was demoted from pay level  to level  but cordero fails to note that that demotion did not occur until eisenhauer had a third safety incident the fact remains that eisenhauer received a mere written warning for his first two incidents of property damage g exs      cordero further asserts neither christiansen nor eisenhauer was similarly situated to clapp because neither had achieved clapps level of seniority petrs br  however cordero introduced no evidence of any company policy that less experienced miners are afforded greater leniency for property damage and insubordination indeed the fact that clapp was a skilled and experienced operator could just as easily make her purported misconduct � questioning the safety of a practice and using her discretion as to the best means to dislodge a stuck truck � more appropriate than it would be from a less senior employee see tr  testimony of colby that level  shovel operators are trusted by their supervisors to lead and take control of their runs     in sum the record contains ample evidence from which a judge could infer retaliation turner  fmshrc at  emphasis in original  back to top d    substantial evidence supports the aljs finding that clapps discharge was motivated by her protected safety complaints and that cordero would not have discharged her if she had not made those complaints     as noted above the operator may establish an affirmative defense by showing that it would have taken the adverse action based on unprotected activity alone pasula  fmshrc at  eastern associated coal  fd at  in evaluating the employers affirmative defense the question is not whether the employer could have taken the adverse action for a legitimate business reason but whether it did take the adverse action for a legitimate business reason and would have taken the adverse action for that reason alone pasula  fmshrc at  interstate builders inc v nlrb  fd   th cir  thus the employers defense should not be examined superficially or approved automatically once proffered haro v magma copper co  fmshrc    rather the judges job is to determine whether the defense is credible and if so whether it would have motivated the operator in question as claimed bradley v belva coal co  fmshrc        where the operators asserted justification is weak implausible or out of line with normal business practices a finding of pretext may be appropriate chacon  fmshrc at  see also interstate builders  fd at  pretext may be established by showing that the proffered justification had no basis in fact or that the proffered justification did not actually motivate the discharge because the circumstantial evidence tends to prove that an unlawful motivation was more likely than that offered by the employer turner  fmshrc at      here the alj found that each of corderos proffered justifications either was actually false or was not in fact relied upon because the circumstantial evidence of discrimination made it more likely than not that corderos insubordination defense was a pretext alj dec  accordingly the alj concluded that cordero failed to establish that it would have discharged clapp for insubordination in the absence of her protected activity id at      as noted above at the hearing cordero managers offered multiple conflicting explanations as to why clapp was purportedly discharged for insubordination see supra p  in its brief to this court cordero again gives conflicting explanations of the acts of insubordination that purportedly resulted in clapps discharge cordero asserts that regardless of any protected activity clapp would have been terminated for her behavior on march   alone when she disregarded orders to attend an important meeting petrs br  yet corderos ensuing explanation of the insubordination that purportedly led to clapps discharge encompasses much more than the march  incident cordero begins its defense of the discharge by discussing clapps allegedly inappropriate behavior on march  when fischer and robinson called a meeting to reprimand her for bringing her safety complaints to vaccari id at  several pages later cordero asserts clapps actions in the days leading up to the meeting on march   also provide ample examples of her insubordination and then goes on to discuss clapps alleged lightloading of trucks the fact that clapp was allegedly making truck drivers feel uncomfortable and the fact that clapp was allegedly using the radio to undermine her supervisors authority in a very unprofessional manner id at  it should be emphasized that before the alj cordero did not argue that clapps discharge was based either on lightloading or on making drivers feel uncomfortable  alj dec  n and  those afterthought arguments therefore not only underscore the stillshifting nature of corderos defense but are improperly before the court  usc � a     as a preliminary matter as the alj noted where an employer provides an inconsistent or shifting rationale for its actions a reasonable inference can be drawn that the reason proffered is a pretext designed to mask an unlawful motive whittington v nordam group inc  fd   th cir  gatx logistics inc  nlrb    enforced  fd  th cir  moreover the fact that cordero is still unable even in its brief to the court to explain the discharge decision consistently and without reference to clapps protected activity severely undermines its argument that it would have discharged her regardless of that activity rather in continually attempting to justify the discharge by referring to clapps safetyrelated activity cordero demonstrates that the discharge decision was inextricably linked to its managers animus towards her protected safety complaints     with regard to the alleged instances of insubordination themselves the alj first noted that clapp did not send trucks to the hopper or otherwise disregard the dumping directive rather as the alj explained clapp challenged the directive as unsafe but then complied with the directive and took her safety concerns to vaccari and oistad alj dec  furthermore other miners had taken trucks to the hopper after the governor engaged and received no discipline alj dec      with regard to babcocks assertion that clapp was insubordinate in going to another supervisor with her concerns the alj found that this action was clearly protected activity and thus was an unlawful basis for discharge alj dec  with regard to the claim that clapp was insubordinate because she failed to acknowledge that fischer and robinson were her supervisors during the march  meeting the alj found that clapp clearly acknowledged her supervisors authority at the end of the march  meeting and acknowledged the need to follow the chain of command id  back to top     to the extent that cordero relied on clapps comments during the march  meeting as a basis for her discharge the alj found that these comments were provoked by fischers intemperate language and his anger that clapp had gone to vaccari and oistad with her safety concerns alj dec  citing bernardyn  fmshrc at  vought corp  nlrb   n  enforced  fd  th cir  trustees of boston univ v nlrb  fd   st cir  nlrb v m  b headwear  fd   th cir  accordingly the alj properly found that clapps remarks were not a lawful basis for discipline id     the alj found that corderos argument that clapp was discharged for failing to attend a meeting on march  was not credible for four reasons first the alj found that no specific meeting was scheduled for march  alj dec  rather the alj found that babcocks statement was ambiguous when he told clapp to come in tomorrow ready to go and that well finish up the conversation tomorrow  g ex a pp  essentially babcock simply told clapp to report for work at the normal time tr      second the alj found that clapp had the approval of both fischer and vaccari to take the day off the alj credited clapps testimony that after clapp reiterated to fischer that she needed to take a floater fischer said okay fine and hung up tr  vaccaris own notes from his march  meeting with clapp and whitted confirm that clapp told vaccari that fischer had not told clapp she could not take a floater but instead ended the conversation by saying okay goodbye r ex  the alj also observed that based on clapps exemplary attendance record during her  years at the mine she was not the type of employee who would deliberately fail to show up for a scheduled meeting alj dec      although fischer and robinson testified that fischer did not say okay but rather ended the conversation by telling clapp that he would have hr call her the aljs credibility determination was based his observation of the witnesses demeanor and the inherent probability of their testimony in light of other evidence in the record and is thus entitled to great deference alj dec  n webco indus  fd at  plateau mining  fd at  we may not displace the agencys choice between two fairly conflicting views     furthermore the alj found that clapp had vaccaris tacit approval to take the day off and that fischer was aware of this in their phone call on march  clapp told vaccari that she had been up all night because of her concerns and did not feel that she should come to work and vaccari said i understand tr    on examination by the alj vaccari acknowledged that he knew that clapp might assume he had given her tacit approval to take the day off tr  when he arrived at the mine vaccari told fischer that clapp had told him of her need to take a floater and that vaccari had told her that he understood tr      third the alj found that clapp did not receive clemetsons message asking her to report to the mine and that clemetson was aware that her message was never received alj dec  the alj credited clapps testimony that clapp checked her messages that day and did not receive a call or message from anyone at the mine  tr   the alj noted that unlike on march  clemetson did not ask clapp to confirm receipt of the message and did not call clapp later in the day to ask whether she had received the message alj dec  the alj further noted clapps excellent attendance record and the corresponding unlikelihood that she would ignore a message to attend a meeting and the fact that clapp responded to the march  voicemail immediately upon receipt id like the aljs decision to credit clapps testimony regarding her conversation with fischer the aljs decision to credit clapps testimony regarding clemetsons message is entitled to a high degree of deference see laborers local   fd at  where the alj heard live testimony from various competing witnesses found one witness credible explained his bases for doing so and other record evidence tended to confirm that finding unavoidably we must conclude substantial evidence exists to support the aljs finding     fourth the alj found that management knew at the time of the discharge that clapp had not received clemetsons message and that vaccari had given tacit approval for clapp to take the day off alj dec  n  these facts further undermine corderos position that it would have discharged clapp for failing to show up to work on march  even in the absence of its animus towards her based on her protected safety complaints     cordero argues that the alj impermissibly substituted his own business judgment for the legitimate business reason proffered by cordero petrs br  to the contrary the alj determined that the reasons offered by cordero were not credible and did not constitute the true motivation for clapps discharge this is precisely the role of the alj under the case law cited by cordero eg bradley  fmshrc at  aljs role is to determine whether employers reasons are credible and if so whether they would have motivated the particular operator as claimed     finally cordero argues that the alj improperly considered corderos retaliation against whitted in finding that clapps discharge was motivated by unlawful animus petrs br  n to the contrary the fact that whitted also suffered retaliation after both she and clapp met with vaccari to discuss safety concerns is relevant to establishing that cordero was motivated by unlawful animus when it discharged clapp the aljs finding that cordero retaliated against whitted is supported by substantial evidence whitteds testimony that her supervisors told her they no longer had a working relationship and accused her of lying when she and clapp met with vaccari is more than adequate to support a finding of retaliation and animus tr      in sum substantial evidence including a host of permissible credibility determinations supports the aljs finding that cordero would not have discharged clapp

found that cordero failed to meet its burden to show clapp failed to mitigate damages and ordered full back pay for the period from her discharge on march   until her economic reinstatement on june   alj dec  the alj noted that clapp testified that she searched for work during the back pay period but was unsuccessful id tr  clapp sought the assistance of the local workforce office to search for jobs and did not limit her search to shovel operator positions tr   through her search clapp identified one opening submitted an application and was called for an interview clapp testified that the interview was difficult because she had to explain that she had been discharged tr  clapp testified that she then looked for other positions but submitted no additional applications tr      the alj rejected corderos argument that clapps failure to apply for more than one position constituted a failure make reasonable efforts to find new employment rather the alj credited clapps testimony that she continued to search for work during the fourteenweek period and did not limit her search to shovel operator positions and found that this effort constituted a reasonable search alj dec  on appeal cordero merely repeats its argument that clapps failure to apply for more than one job constituted a failure to make reasonable efforts petrs br  because cordero fails to identify any clear error of judgment by the alj the back pay award constituted an appropriate exercise of discretion and should be upheld eastman  fd at   back to top c    the alj acted within his discretion in assessing a civil penalty of  based on the gravity of the violation corderos negligence and lack of good faith in attempting to achieve rapid compliance and the size of corderos business     judges have broad discretion in assessing penalties under the mine act walker stone co v secy of labor  fd   th cir  in assessing the penalty an alj is required to address six statutory criteria  the operators history of previous violations  the appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business  whether the operator was negligent  the effect on the operators ability to continue in business  the gravity of the violation and  any demonstrated good faith in attempting to achieve rapid compliance id at  once the alj makes findings of fact on each of the statutory criteria the aljs penalty assessment for a particular violation is an exercise of discretion which is bounded by proper consideration for the statutory criteria and the deterrent purposes of the act secy of labor v sellersburg stone co  fmshrc    affd  fd  th cir  there is no requirement that equal weight be assigned to each of the criteria secy of labor v thunder basin coal co  fmshrc        under existing case law the alj assesses the penalty de novo and is not bound by the secretarys proposed penalty however when the aljs assessment substantially diverges from that proposed by the secretary the alj must provide a sufficient explanation of the bases underlying the penalty assessed sellersburg fmshrc at      here alj acted properly because he made findings with regard to each of the six criteria and explained his basis for increasing the secretarys proposed penalty alj dec  with regard to the first criterion the alj found no history of � c violations id at  with regard to the second and fourth criteria the alj found that cordero is a large mine and introduced no evidence that its ability to continue in business would be impaired by the penalty id at      with regard to negligence the alj found that corderos negligence was high because management knew or should have known that clapps discharge was unlawful based on the strength of the prima facie case and the pretextual nature of the alleged insubordination id at  the alj also found that the gravity of the violation was severe particularly in light of the purpose of the act and the severe chilling effect of clapps termination on the willingness of other miners to raise safety concerns id at  finally the alj found that cordero did not demonstrate good faith in attempting to achieve compliance because cordero contested clapps temporary reinstatement to her position at the mine and failed to respond to certain discovery requests during the proceedings on the merits id at      the alj explained that he found the secretarys proposed penalty of  to be inadequate because of the severe chilling effect of clapps discharge on other miners the alj based his finding on the testimony of the miner witnesses at the hearing who not only spoke of their fear of raising safety concerns in light of corderos treatment of clapp but also expressed fear of retaliation simply for testifying about the events surrounding clapps discharge in light of this testimony and given the overarching purpose of the act to encourage miners to raise safety concerns the alj doubled the penalty to  alj dec      cordero argues that the alj erred in considering the chilling effect on other miners because the secretarys complaint was brought on behalf of clapp alone petrs br  to the contrary the commission has properly held that the chilling effect on other miners is a legitimate consideration in determining the gravity of a � c violation secy of labor ex rel johnson v jim walter resources inc  fmshrc    commission considers both subjective and objective evidence in determining chilling effect     cordero also argues that the alj erred because he disregarded evidence of corderos safety history and previous lack of � c complaints and focused instead on the chilling effect this argument should be rejected because the alj complied with his obligation to make findings on each of the six criteria and was free thereafter to weigh the criteria as he saw fit thunder basin coal co  fmshrc at      finally cordero contests the aljs findings with regard to whether cordero demonstrated good faith in attempting to achieve rapid compliance petrs br  to the contrary the aljs findings are supported by substantial evidence and the aljs reliance on them was a proper exercise of discretion the alj correctly noted that although the mine act requires full temporary reinstatement ie compliance upon an appropriate finding by the secretary cordero contested reinstatement when notified by the secretary that clapp was entitled to temporary reinstatement and instead agreed only to economic reinstatement alj dec  corderos position that it had no reason to consider reinstating clapp until the secretarys request for temporary reinstatement on june   is also incorrect because cordero was forwarded a copy of clapps complaint when it was filed  usc � c finally the alj correctly noted that cordero failed to respond to certain discovery requests during the proceeding on the merits and acted within his discretion in finding that in the circumstances � ie in light of the fact that corderos entire defense was pretextual � that failure which only served to prolong corderos reinstatement of clapp demonstrated a lack of good faith in attempting to achieve rapid compliance   back to top conclusion     for the foregoing reasons the secretary respectfully requests that the court deny corderos petition for review and affirm the decision of the alj statement regarding oral argument     given that the aljs conclusions are adequately supported by substantial evidence in the record including permissible credibility determinations and the case raises no significant legal questions the secretary believes that oral argument is not necessary respectfully submitted m patricia smithsolicitor of labor heidi w strasslerassociate solicitor w christian schumanncounsel appellate litigation signednancy e

of the aljs decision     this issue was raised on page  of the secretarys complaint of discrimination and ruled on at pages  and  of the aljs decision     the following abbreviations are used to refer to portions of the record alj dec for decision and order of the administrative law judge dec   tr for transcript of alj hearing feb   g ex for the secretarys exhibits submitted at the alj hearing and r ex for corderos exhibits submitted at the alj hearing     unless otherwise noted all disputed facts are described as they were found by the alj below     although cordero claims in its brief that turning and dumping at the face was a common practice the evidence does not support its claim the alj found that miners testified credibly and consistently that the practice had never been performed prior to march  alj dec  tr    moreover other than general statements by management witnesses that the task was common none of the evidence cited by cordero demonstrates that the task was ever performed prior to march  instead corderos evidence consists of staged photographs taken in preparation for litigation r exs   training materials instructing operators how to dump dirt at a trash dump r ex  and a powerpoint presentation stating that trucks should be dumped at the face if they weigh over  tons r ex      wyoming is a oneparty consent state see wyo stat � biv accordingly the original recording and transcript of audible portions of the recording was received into evidence as g ex  and a respectively after cordero withdrew its objection to the transcript tr        the alj also found that clapp engaged in extensive protected activity between november of  and january of  alj dec  because the alj ultimately found that clapps discharge was motivated by her protected safety complaints in march of  discussion of these earlier incidents is not necessary to support the finding that clapps discharge was unlawful id at  it should be noted however that cordero is incorrect in asserting that the alj committed legal error by considering the  and  incidents as evidence of protected activity because that evidence is timebarred by � c of the act  usc � c petrs br  although � c requires a miner to file a complaint within  days of the alleged discrimination in this case clapps discharge nothing in the statute precludes the alj from considering evidence of protected activity or animus that occurred more than  days prior to the filing of the complaint  usc � c     cordero argues that the alj erred in finding that clapp told robinson why she felt the procedure was unsafe petrs br  to the contrary the aljs finding is supported by truck driver halversons testimony as corroborated by supervisor robinsons own notes of the incident which contradicted robinsons testimony at the hearing that clapp did not tell him why she believed the practice was unsafe tr  r ex  in any event as discussed below clapps comments were protected regardless of whether she explained why she believed the practice was unsafe see infra pp      cordero asserts that clapps statements that the trucks were not actually overloaded is inconsistent with a concern for safety petrs br  to the contrary the fact that clapp may have believed it was safe to drive the trucks to the hopper because they were not overloaded is in no way inconsistent with her belief that the dumping process itself was unsafe because of the dark narrow and uneven conditions in the coal pit certainly that fact does not support a conclusion that clapps complaints were not related to safety     related to this argument cordero argues that the alj erred in finding that clapp raised safety concerns regarding the dumping procedure to the safety department petrs br  however because the aljs legal analysis does not list clapps complaints to the safety department among the evidence of her protected activity it is not necessary to determine whether the aljs finding that clapp raised such complaints is supported by substantial evidence alj dec  for the same reason corderos argument that the alj erred in not resolving why clapp asked whitted why whitted was not in the meeting with her on march  is not relevant petrs br      cordero argues that the alj erred in not resolving why clapp purportedly could not explain how she was the one not wearing a seatbelt when she was the driver petrs br  to the contrary the alj explained that clapp took responsibility for failing to wear a seatbelt so that no other miner would receive discipline alj dec      in any event the behavior that allegedly made drivers feel uncomfortable � clapps public voicing of her safetyrelated concerns about the dumping directive � was protected activity and thus not a lawful basis for discharge     cordero argues that the alj erred in finding that clapp did not hear babcocks statement petrs br  to the contrary the alj discredited that testimony from clapp alj dec  it is both common and acceptable for a factfinder to credit some parts of a witnesss testimony and to discredit other parts kadia v gonzales  fd   th cir      cordero asserts that clapps credibility on this issue was compromised because she testified both that she slept all day and that whitted came to her home that day which whitted denied petrs br  there is nothing inconsistent about clapp or whitteds testimony clapp spoke with fischer sometime before  am and then spoke to whitted at the end of the day tr  whitted testified that she could not recall whether she went to clapps home on march  tr      as the rapid compliance penalty criterion indicates the mine act is an abatenowlitigatelater statute see generally thunder basin coal  fmshrc at  an operator has a right to litigate an alleged violation � but before it exercises that right it has a duty to abate the violation  back to top sol home about sol the solicitor immediate office national divisions regional offices sol brochure organization charts immediate office national divisions regional
