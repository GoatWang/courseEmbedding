caring family of john j dolan jr announces and mourns his passing at age  after a brave struggle with parkinson’s disease john was a th generation new canaanite with an artist’s heart and a genuinely compassionate personality that always sought and found the goodness in others regardless as to their station in life kindness towards all was his “modus operandi” john graduated from new canaan high school in  during high school he played lacrosse and operated a successful hauling and tree service it was during this time that john discovered long island and surfing two loves that remained with him for the rest of his life he attended bryant university in rhode island graduating in  and afterwards lived and surfed in sag harbor and bridgehampton long island where he ran a respected landscaping concern he also spent time living in cambridge massachusetts many remember john for his red trucks which he used to haul brush as well as his surfboards john renovated several homes in ridgefield and new canaan teaching himself the art of construction as with much in life john was largely selftaught evolving from a furniture maker to a master builder always compassionate toward the young john worked as an instructor for outward bound teaching life skills to troubled youth through outdoor activities and kayaking john’s adventurous nature and love of surfing took him across the globe the ski slopes of aspen colorado the woods of vermont and maine the beaches of california morocco nicaragua peru mexico bali australia martha’s vineyard and coastal rhode island were just a few of the many places that john could be found everywhere john went he developed lifelong friendships and touched people’s lives it was in costa rica that john’s heart settled down specifically in the santa teresamal pais area on the nicoya peninsula there john combined his love of surfing and building and for  years lived a life of adventure and dedication to a vision – the creation of an incredible oneofakind boutique hotel and retreat he aptly named “casa verde” john in the vein of other visionaries and knowing no bounds took a raw piece of land perched on a steep hillside overlooking the pacific ocean and carved out the foundations for casa verde from which many beautiful ocean sunsets were enjoyed it was his personal “buena vista” acting as his own architect and engineer he designed and built from the ground up a living monument to his ability taste and style every inch of the property – from the intricate mosaics to the hand sanded rafters – reflect john’s personality high craftsmanship and dedication to his art every piece of furniture within casa verde was designed by john and built by hand john poured his life and spirit into casa verde where his presence is palpable john’s legacy in costa rica is not limited to the structures at casa verde a man of intense artistry skill and passion john remained humble and kind he built more than walls he fostered the growth and development of the dozens of men who labored alongside him over the years those fortunate enough to work with “juan” learned valuable trades and skills which have improved their lives and the lives of their families in santa teresa he touched the lives of many of the locals people said “john always had time to stop and talk to ask after me and my family to offer to help us if needed” his passing has left a large hole in the heart of the community john was deeply committed to his family particularly his nephews rob campbell mary peter campbell jill matt campbell jamie dolan jack dolan and his nieces riley dolan and audrey dolan the next generation of great nieces and nephews caroline campbell lily campbell connor campbell and kate campbell brought him much joy his project manager’s young son josue also occupied a special place in his heart all brought him tremendous joy and were his “raison de etre” john relished their deep friendships and accomplishments

sisters meg campbell rob of wilton marianne k dolan of new york city his brothers peter dolan julie of basalt colorado and chris dolan julie of san rafael california he touched the lives of hundreds

beta tests as part of their product development program beta testing can validate the product concept eliminate performance problems prior to market introduction and serve as an effective sales promotion device the risks are significant however in that a poorly designed test can destroy account relationships generate inaccurate data on product performance and stimulate negative publicity

john red dog dolan company commander of a company  pir to general james gavin   wriiten in  at the urging of robert murphy the letter provides a very detailed account of a companys legendary actions at la fiere bridge general gavins transmittal letter to famed author cornelius ryan is also enclosed john j dolan attorney at law box    milk street boston   mass  march     lt general james n gavin co arthur d little inc  memorial drive cambridge mass dear general gavin     thank you for your letter of march   it had always been my intention of answering the questionnaire of cornelius ryan but realizing that it would take considerable time to give a detailed and accurate account i kept putting it aside and then completely forgot about it until bob murphy spoke to me about it a few days before receipt of your letter     i shall try to cover as much detail without making this letter too voluminous leaving it to your judgment and discretion to delete any portion that you deem unfavorable to the outfit you may recall that i was in command of company a  parachute infantry with the rank of first lieutenant the specific mission of the company a was to seize and defend the bridge crossing the merderet river on the road that ran east to west from ste mere eglise with the purpose of preventing the movement of german troops down to the beachhead     i dont recall exactly what time the first battalion jumped but it was between  and  am on dday we hit our drop zone right on the nose because within twenty minutes to onehalf hour i knew our exact location i was able to identify a t intersection dirt roads  to  feet wide near our drop zone the upper arm of which ran generally east to west the vertical arm running north to south to meet the road running from ste mere eglise to our objective the bridge at the merderet river     we had the usual problems of reorganization in the dark however about an hour before dawn company a moved out from the drop zone with about ninety  per cent of the men accounted for this was not due to luck alone but to the cooperation of officers noncoms and last but not least training men who have to fight in the night should be trained in nighttime fighting not just taken on a night march and digging foxholes we moved along this dirt road which i previously referred to as being the northsouth arm of the t intersection and just around here i ran into major mcginity he moved out with us     the order of march was first co headquarters third and second platoons in that order when we reached the road running eastwest from ste mere eglise a german motorcycle passed us going toward ste mere eglise at this time it was still dark but daylight was starting to break we crossed the road and started west toward the bridgewith a hedge row to our right between us and the road just about this time contact was lost with the first platoon so the third platoon took the lead     about seven to eight hundred yards from the bridge we came upon a dirt road running southeasterly from the road to the bridge hedgerows were on either side of this road and beyond it in the direction of the bridge was an open flat field about  yards deep and about  yards wide it was here that i figured the germans would defend if they intended a defense of the bridge     i directed lt donald coxon to send his scouts out this he did and he also went out with them he had plenty of personal courage but he didnt have the heart to order them out without going with them     a few moments later a german machine gun opened up killing lt coxon and one of his scouts fergueson their fire was returned and with major mcginity and myself leading a few men holding and returning frontal fire the platoon flanked to the left at the same time i directed lt presnell to recross the road and attack along the northern side down to the bridge this was done and the second platoon didnt meet with any fire until they arrived at the bridge     the third platoon continued its flanking move and cut back in toward the road to the bridge because of the fire we calculated that there was just one machine gun crew that was in our way it later turned out that there must have been at least a squad dug in at this point with at least two of them armed with machine pistols prisoners captured later in addition to the german dead amounted to about the size of one of our platoons there were no german officers captured i dont know whether or not any of their enlisted men escaped     to continue we cut back toward the road travelling in a northerly direction major mcginity was leading and i was about three or four paces behind and slightly to the right there was a high thick hedgerow to our left and it was in here that i figured the machine gun was located     when we had traveled about twothirds of the way up the hedgerow they opened up on us with rifle and at least two machine pistols i returned the fire with my thompson submachine gun at a point where i could see leaves in the hedgerow fluttering major mcginity was killed instantly as luck would have it there was a german foxhole to my left which i jumped into and from where i continued to fire i could only guess where to shoot but i had to as part of the third platoon was exposed to their fire lt mclaughlin the assistant platoon leader was wounded and died later that day his radio operator was also killed the platoon by now was under fire from two directions from the point where i was pinned down and also from the direction of the bridge     i cant estimate how long we were pinned down in this fashion but it was at least an hour i made several attempts to move but drew their fire on my last attempt i drew no fire they obviously had pulled out during all of this time i could hear rifle and machine gunfire down by the bridge on the north side this ceased about this time i returned to the rest of the third platoon instructed the noncoms to reorganize and to maintain their present position i then crossed the road and located the first platoon commanded by lt oakley on the north side they were moving toward the bridge so i instructed them to continue and dig in on the right side i went down to the bridge and found that we had received an assist from some of the  prcht infantry about this time i ran into col eckman and sent for my third platoon to dig in on the left or south side of the bridge the first was already digging in on the north side  i thought that all of the germans had retreated but unknown to us there were about ten or twelve germans holed up on the second floor of a stuccotype farmhouse at the time they started firing col eckman and i were casually looking the situation over it lasted about twenty minutes with about ten or twelve germans surrendering about a squad of men from the  made the actual capture     we dug in the disposition of my company as follows first platoon on the north side of the road the third on the south and the second in reserve about oo yards back so that it could also protect the rear     major kellam arrived at the bridge with capt roysden his s he had most of his cp unit with him i dont know whether or not a battalion cp had ever been set up as planned at least i dont recall having had any communication with it down at the bridge now was most of company a about one platoon or company b a platoon of the division engineers mission to blow the bridge if necessary about half of battalion headquarters company with mortars awl machine gun sections and several stray men from other regiments the company dug in well and quickly i had just completed my inspection of the forward positions when we knew that an attack was coming you will recall that in front of our position west of the merderet river was a marsh at least  yards wide at its narrowest point the road running west from the bridge could better be described as a causeway     as i recall the mission of the  was to occupy a position beyond this causeway in addition to the men who assisted us in capturing the bridge at least a company of the  passed through our position and moved over the causeway to their objective they were gone at least an hour when we saw several of them retreating back across the marsh i remember that we helped several of them out of the river which was quite shallow     the machine gun fire from the germans was very heavy by now we didnt return their fire as there were no visible targets and our ammunition supply was limited they attacked with three tanks which i was unable to identify for sure but they appeared to be similar to the german mark iv type or maybe a little lighter the tanks were firing on us with machine guns and cannon     just about a halfhour before this attack a mm a t gun was assigned to company a i located this gun about  yards from the bridge on the road where it curves to the right as you approach the bridge incidentally this was my cp and later the battalion cp this gave the gun excellent cover and a good field of fire     on the bridge i had three bazooka teams two of them were from company a and the third was either from b or c company the two company a bazookas were dug in to the left and right of the bridge because of the fact that the road itself was the causeway type they were as of necessity dug in below the level of the road so that in order to fire they had to get out of their foxholes the third bazooka was over more to the south where better cover was available     to continue i had just completed my inspection of our defenses and was  to  yards from the bridge major kellam and captain royaden were nearby the first two tanks were within  qr  yards of each other the third was back about  yards when the lead tank was about  or  yards away from the bridge the two company a bazooka teams got up just like clock work to the edge of the road they were under the heaviest small arms fire from the other side of the causeway and from the cannon and machine gun fire from the tanks to this day ill never be able to explain why all four of them were not killed they fired and reloaded with the precision of welloiled machinery watching them made it hard to believe that this was nothing but a routine drill i dont think that either crew wasted a shot the first tank received several direct hits the treads were knocked off and within a matter of minutes it was on fire then they went to work on the second tank and within about  seconds it was on fire they fired every rocket that they had and then jumped into their foxholes the mm during this time was firing and eventually knocked out the last tank the gun crew did an excellent job     my two bazooka crews called for more ammunition major kellam ran up toward the bridge with a bag of rockets followed by captain roysden when they were within  or  yards of the bridge the germans opened up with mortar fire on the bridge major kellam was killed and captain roysden was rendered unconscious from the concussion he died later that day both of the bazookas were destroyed by the mortar fire lt weir reg hq co and i carried captain roysden back i then took over command of the battalion being the senior officer present     company b was put into reserve in the perimeter of company a so that we had almost a  degree perimeter defense the rest of the day we were under heavy mortar and machine gun fire the mortar fire was very effective as against the two forward platoons because of tree bursts it took very little imagination on the part of the krauts to figure out just where we would be dug in as i recall there was less than a seventyfive yard frontage on either side of the bridge from where we could effectively defend so they could throw their mortar fin in our general direction with good results during the night the fire let up but they started early the next morning and kept it up my third platoon took the worst beating as they were in a heavier wooded area tree bursts     the second tank attack came on the afternoon of the second day i was over on the north side of the bridge with the first platoon for about an hour before the attack they increased their mortar fire to the extent that the third platoon was just about knocked out but not quite i was not aware of this at the time in addition to already heavy casualties sgt monahan the platoon sgt was fatally wounded      i learned second hand that some other troops had retreated through the third platoons position and then through my cp rumors were around that we were going to give up the bridge as a result of this the mm at crew took off i didnt have an executive officer at the time earlier that day he tom furey was put in command of c company my first sergeant was a jump casualty so my company headquarters at the time was nonexistent except for runners and radio operators i cant recall why but our radios were not working the only way that we could communicate was through runners     the first platoon was under heavy fire also the platoon leader lt oakley who had been doing an excellent job was fatally wounded and sgt ricci was leaving the junior squad leader sgt owens in command you will recall that we have had some communication about sgt owens in the past as to his personal courage and the way he commanded the platoon at this most critical time i recommended sgt owens and my tour bazooka men for the dsc the bazooka men were awarded the dsc but sgt owens was not this is a story in itself     the second attack was with two tanks and infantry i was unable to estimate the size the tanks stayed out of effective bazooka range we had one bazooka left not hearing any fire from the mm i went over to it and found it unmanned i tried to fire it but the crew had taken the firing mechanism i organized five or six men behind the hedge on the southerly side of the road with gammon grenades and just about this time two of the gun crew returned with the firing mechanism they knocked out the two tanks they were two youngsters not more than  or  years old who returned on their own initiative i recommended them for silver stars     the rest of our stay at the bridge was uneventful except for the continued mortar fire and at the end artillery fire which damaged the mm lt col mark alexander took over command of the battalion later that day and continued to command it for most of the operation without exception he was the finest battalion commander i ever served under my second son mark alexander dolan was named after him    in conclusion we held the bridge until relieved in co a alone in those days three in all we had seventeen known dead and about three times that number wounded the rest of the battalion also had heavy casualties      i have tried to give you an accurate picture of what happened however after fifteen years the foregoing may contain some minor inaccuracies i will be glad to give mr ryan any additional information he may require you may assure him that i will be happy to cooperate with him in every detail                                                        very truly yours                                             jjdeg ps since writing this letter i have read the account by david howarth in the saturday evening post and i agree with you that it contains many inaccuracies you will probably note that some of the events related tie in with what i have told you in this letter the most glaring inaccuracy is about the bridge being lost for the record this bridge was held by company a from the time of its capture on d day until we were relieved response from general james gavin to cornelius ryan  aurthur d little inc established  thirty memorial drive cambridge  massachusetts  march   mr cornelius ryan
