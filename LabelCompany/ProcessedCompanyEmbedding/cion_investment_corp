in  cell phones are as vital to us as the air we breathe between both old and young from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system without one people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies the vast majority of american adults    now own a cell phone this has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market of which itll is now becoming a key player with such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat this is where otc itll comes into play their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space since itll is a public company we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry we’ve done some digging and have laid out  reasons why we believe itll may be the most profitable stock play of  breaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements owcp   massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time theyre so common in fact we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations month after month for example in  alone weve already seen several major acquisitions telecom service provider gtt communications announced in june that it plans to buy network connectivity provider global capacity for  million in cash and  million shares of gtt common stock we also saw that in april windstream announced its plan to acquire cloudbased unified communications provider broadview networks in an allcash transaction worth  million and if that isnt enough in march zayo group holdings inc closed its  billion acquisition of electric lightwave the company formerly known as integra telecom all of this happened in just the last few monthsall this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether itll has what it takes to dance with the big guys well it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model big companies like verizon are making money hand over fist  why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usualitll has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive a similar situation took place in canada some years ago when a company named wind mobile came into play over a few short years wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition recently shaw bought them out for  billion as a result of all this our opinion of the itll business model is excellent  weve seen this business model work before   qb status and  stars from morningstar  this is a statement that often attracts negativity from skeptics and selfpronounced market professionals and frankly its understandable it seems too good to be true we always encourage our readers to do their own duediligence and this is one of those scenarios dig through message boards scanners and blogs and youll quickly realize that stocks are making major moves like this on a regular basis this isnt some mythical unicorn  once again stocks do this on a regular basis below you can see some examples of movements like this but believe us when we say there are many many more  one trade can make profits of  or more  bldv   at the time of writing this article itll is sitting at  cents we believe that this is an extremely attractive price for a company of this caliber as was observed above acquisitions in this industry often come in at hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in addition to this  cents is an excellent place for traders and investors to turn quicker profits it is much easier for a stock to double or triple at these prices in a very short period of time it’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price”  warren buffet  the stock is priced right better than right  website   intelligentcloudresourcescomfloat          learn more the otcqb is an elite tier of the over the counter markets these are companies that have audited financials available are current in their reporting have verified management and shareholders and additional disclosure requirements to meet all in all this signifies that itll is on the ball and doing business the right way morningstar rates otcitll at an excellent  stars meaning it is of fair value the rating is determined by three factors a stocks current price morningstars estimate of the stocks fair value and the uncertainty rating of the fair value the bigger the discount the higher the star rating once again an excellent omen for savvy

diligence thoroughly before making a buying decision good trading sincerely the american tech report team keep track of otc itll filings and disclosure sign up for updates on newscharts and other information we respect your privacy and never share your information with anyone  when going up against telecom giants a company has to hold a competitive edge to stand out through our due diligence we have found this to be undoubtedly true for itll the cornerstone to every customer seeking a cell provider is the smartphones that they have available smartphones are expensive for your average consumer as many flagship phones sit around the  mark itll has seemed to solve this problem by partnering up with the smartphone manufacturer leagoo these phones have everything that the typical consumer wants at a fraction of the cost they are well built stylish powerful and power through daily functions like taking photographs and browsing the web on par with phones that are five times the price all of this seems consistent with itlls commitment to lower prices and maintain their competitive edge in addition to this they are offering all subscribers a premium mastercard no questions asked we believe that many consumers will find this to be an irresistible offer making the growth potential for itll very attractive   the most competitive tech and phones on the market  stock data

the profiled issuer and  or third party paying us our publication of the information is known as a “campaign” this information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes hours days or even weeks apart typically the trading volume and price of a profiled issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors therefore the later an investor receives the information the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a profiled issuer late in a campaign we are paid to advertise the

changes to our compensation we own zero shares of itll third parties paying us to market the profiled issuer we believe intend to sell their shares they hold while we tell investors to purchase during the campaign intelligent cloud resources inc is a penny stock that was illiquid little to no trading volume prior to our campaign and therefore these securities are subject to wide fluctuations in trading price and volume during the campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each profile issuer will likely increase significantly because of the media exposure when the campaign

by allchannel trend reportalt investments bdcs good for the broker bad for the client in the wake of the implosion of many nontraded reits nontraded business development companies bdcs have emerged as a relatively new structure that is getting a lot of attention but with high upfront fees and limited liquidity some say they’re not good for the client diana britton  jul   in the world of investing product departments are constantly putting new spins on old ideas confident there will always be investors looking for the next best thing that will provide outsized yield most of those new ideas are meant to make lots of money for the people who sell them less often they make money for the investors who buy them  in the wake of the implosion of many nontraded reits nontraded business development companies bdcs have emerged as a relatively new structure that is getting a lot of attention but with high upfront fees limited liquidity and sometimes a reliance on leverage to goose returns buyer beware “in my opinion brokers should not be selling private anything—private placement private reit private business development corporation—because it limits the flexibility it limits liquidity it limits transparency and it almost always means higher fees internal” said joshua brown vice president of investments at fusion analytics investment partners “the only reason nontraded bdcs get sold is because it’s product and it’s sexy and it’s a way for a broker to get a higher fee for the same dollars that they would put into a public version” according to tony chereso president and ceo of factright the frontend loads on bdcs are fairly similar to nontraded reits which are high  typically around  to  percent on top of that bdcs also typically have an incentive structure of two and twenty charging two percent of assets in management fees and  of capital gains based on performance “the downside is it’s a huge hurdle just to get back to even” because of the upfront fees brown said “do you know how hard it is to generate  percent in this day and age with flat stock markets and treasuries yielding  percent” nontraded bdcs are pitched as highyield vehicles brown said so that’s their sex appeal but they also exist in the public markets so why would you look for one outside of that is the yield going to be that much better probably not” new players in the market whenever a lot of new players jump on a trend and new assets are gathered losses often follow and lately bdcs—the nontraded variety—are gaining a lot of new traction and interest from advisors and product developers   “if they find that the trend is moving towards a new structure other than the nontraded reits i think you might see a groundswell in that direction by some people that are just taking advantage of clients looking for more nontraditional alternative investments that are maybe not subject to the same volatility that the stock market has” said gordon dunne managing director at the financial services network an osj of lpl financial according to factright bdcs have registered approximately  billion in total equity offerings in the first quarter of this year alone bdcs raised  million up from  million raised in the first quarter  according to data by robert a stanger  company shrewsbury njbased investmentbanking firm as of april there were four nontraded bdcs available for investment and another six funds in registration franklin square was the first to launch a nontraded bdc in  but many players new to the space have launched funds recently including cnl securities which uses kohlberg kravis roberts  co as subadvisor icon investment which uses apollo investment management as subadvisor and american realty capital all three firms have a background in nontraded reits these new players are hoping to leverage off of the success of franklin square chereso said franklin square now has  billion in aum and three bdcs the first of which was closed in may “i worry about firms that are in the real estate business then all of a sudden they’re in the business of doing what franklin square does” dunne said “do you really understand credit do you have the wherewithal internally do you have a relationship with firms that have a long track record of making loans to private companies i just hope that the bdc concept doesn’t get confused” dunne’s firm invested  million in franklin square’s first bdc fs investment corporation just as small inexperienced managers entered the reit space over the last decade dunne fears the same thing could happen in the bdc space “there have been quite a few firms that have gravitated to this investment structure” said chereso “some of them have some direct experience” such as on the publicly traded side of bdcs but if a firm’s core competency is in another area such as energy or real estate and they don’t understand credit or credit underwriting “that causes some concerns” chereso said many of these firms launching bdcs have strong financial positions and resources but the question is whether they have the depth of talent and capability to manage these strategies effectively he said   “my biggest concern is there are lots of folks that are jumping into the space particularly the sponsors who don’t have a lot if any experience in corporate credit in writing bdcs” michael forman ceo of franklin square the structure of bdcs bdcs provide financing to small and midsized businesses in recent years they’ve sought to capitalize on the relative lack of debt capital in these markets as banks restricted lending to build their capital reserves stanger says bdcs use a structure similar to nontraded reits in that capital is raised in a continuous private offering but bdcs are regulated under the  act that governs mutual funds the big difference is that they’re valued quarterly while nontraded reits are required to publish their valuations no later than  months after the conclusion of the offering see chart below comparing other aspects of bdcs and reits “i think there’s a lot of concern and skepticism with respect to the reits and they look at us as being different” said forman “i think we’ve kind of forced the reits to have to change their business model a little bit” but they are private vehicles so they don’t have the daily liquidity that comes with the public markets “when you have the opacity and you’re away from the public market your filing requirements are different you don’t have to disclose as much financial metrics as you would if you were public it gives you the opportunity to fudge numbers prolong taking of losses prolong taking of marks in the portfolio brown said tags alt investments real estate  comment hide comments comment  more information about text

potential for attractive yields nontraded business development companies come with a number of risks that financial advisers need to understand fully before selling them to clients according to regulators analysts and industry participants illiquid bdcs are an increasingly popular alternative investment for clients in need of income in a zerointerestrate environment they are sold almost exclusively through independentcontractor brokerdealers bdcs are typically closedend investment companies that invest in debt and equity of private companies yields can be attractive due to bdcs exposure to high credit risks that is amplified by leverage according to the financial industry regulatory authority inc sensitive to economy  zoom keating “the biggest issue facing nontraded bdcs is if we hit a rough patch in the economy” said tim keating chief executive of keating capital inc a publicly traded bdc that was listed in  after six months of raising equity bdcs buy debt of companies that have junk or noninvestmentgrade credit ratings and thus are extremely sensitive to the overall strength of the economy he said questions that arise include the potential default rates on the loans the risk of defaults and whether the loans are repaid to the lender in cash or in kind meaning by issuing more securities he said “this is not anything specific to the bdc vehicle” mr keating said “thats the underlying risk to the asset class do advisers and investors fully understand risks associated with noninvestmentgrade credit” bdc risks were highlighted by securities regulators and a leading analyst earlier this year illiquid bdcs have high expenses that can limit investor returns as well as potentially lower expected returns based on lower yields according to a report by jonathan bock a senior analyst at wells fargo securities llc the historic returns of the companies — because they are relatively new — have been limited to net asset value plus dividend appreciation that has limited an investors ability to buy company stock below nav and experience appreciation mr bock noted there also could be a selloff in the stock of the company when it is listed and begins trading on an exchange he wrote in january finra underscored the risks of nontraded bdcs in its annual list of regulatory and exam priorities those risks include a lack of liquidity finra noted “due to the illiquid nature of nontraded bdcs investors exit opportunities may be limited only to periodic share repurchase by the bdc at high discounts” finra warned it also highlighted bdcs market credit and leverage risks in spite of the risks the nontradedbdc space is growing from  to the end of last year nontraded bdcs raised roughly  billion in total equity mr bock reported he counts seven such closedend funds in operation bdc of america cion investment management corporate capital trust inc fs investment corp fs investment corp ii hms income fund and the sierra income corp one broad criticism of the products is that wellknown managers of nontraded real estate investment trusts such as cnl financial group inc and hines have brought bdc products to market while acting only as distributors those dealermanagers counter that the subadvisers of the bdcs are wellqualified to invest in the privateloan arena for example cnls nontraded bdc corporate capital trust is subadvised by legendary privateequity manager kkr  co lp indeed investors in nontraded bdcs received some encouraging news this month over the next nine to  months — perhaps sooner — the firsttomarket nontraded bdc the  billion fs investment corp plans to complete a “liquidity event” signaling the return of capital to investors fs had an offering price of  per share and its nav was  at the end of last year according to a company filing with the�securities and exchange commission it has returned  per share in distributions or dividends to shareholders who bought the bdc when it was launched in  it stopped raising equity capital last year the liquidity event most likely will be a listing on a national securities exchange fs chief executive michael forman told investors in a conference call this month to increase yield and distribution before a listing its portfolio will transition to higheryielding investments he said in his report mr bock also noted that nontraded bdcs have merits compared with traded bdcs one advantage is less fluctuation of the bdcs value “as a result of the offering price being a function of nav the nontradedbdc model allows investors to see lower volatility in their investments” he wrote nontraded bdcs also have the ability to raise capital and invest at opportune times mr bock wrote “the way a private bdc is structured it is consistently able to raise capital in both good times and bad” he wrote “this eliminates the largest issue of public bdc capitalraising activities which is that it is difficult to tap the equity market when spreads are widest” that ability to raise capital in a steady manner is a plus for nontraded bdcs one industry executive said “a public bdc raises money in a big lump” due to regulatory requirements said bob grunewald chief investment officer of bdc of america and a veteran of the traded bdc industry “with nontraded bdcs the quality of assets is potentially better because they are raising capital on a consistent basis”

downgrades apollo investment corp to bbb maintains negative outlook  business wire fitch downgrades apollo investment corp to bbb maintains negative outlook march    pm eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wirefitch ratings has downgraded the longterm issuer default rating idr secured debt rating and unsecured debt rating for apollo investment corporation apollo to bbb from bbb the rating outlook has been maintained at negative todays rating actions have been taken as part of fitchs periodic peer review of business development companies bdcs which comprises  publicly rated firms bdc industry outlook fitchs outlook for the bdc sector is negative reflecting competitive underwriting conditions earnings pressure underperforming energy investments unsustainable asset quality metrics increased activist pressure and limited access to growth capital while some firms are better positioned given their more conservative financial profiles and portfolio characteristics others are likely to see rating pressure over the outlook horizon bdcs are heavily dependent on the equity markets to fund portfolio growth but access to the market has been almost nonexistent over the last  months as share prices continue to trade at steep discounts to net asset value nav at march   rated bdcs were trading at an  average discount to nav thus preventing most from issuing stock without significantly diluting existing shareholders while the reduction in portfolio growth is viewed favorably by fitch given tough underwriting conditions some firms may struggle to close the trading gap leaving them at a competitive disadvantage if and when investment opportunities arise the decline in commodity prices has yielded the first notable crack in asset quality performance for bdcs more broadly asset quality metrics remain at unsustainably low levels in fitchs opinion while strong portfolio company performance has been supported by an improving economic environment low interest rates are likely masking some potential underlying companyspecific issues as issuers have been able to refinance themselves out of trouble rather easily in recent years fitch believes asset quality metrics are likely to deteriorate over the near term however the pace of deterioration will be somewhat dependent upon the rate of change in interest rates the backdrop of the broader economic environment differing sector exposures and the integrity of individual firms underwriting fitch has not observed a marked increase in leverage levels for the sector with average leverage for investment graderated bdcs of approximately x at yearend  compared to x at yearend  however there is a wide dispersion of leverage around the average and those with the most energy exposure often also have the highest leverage ratios share repurchase activity has also increased in the sector in recent quarters which could inflate leverage ratios further fitch believes that bdcs heavily focused on maximizing leverage run the risk of having less dry powder to deploy if and when underwriting conditions improve thus weakening earnings upside key rating drivers idrs and senior debt the downgrade of apollos ratings and the maintenance of the negative rating outlook are driven by the firms continued outsized exposure to oil  gas investments which remain pressured by depressed commodity prices in addition to large exposures to aircraft financing and structured investments in combination with what fitch believes to be relatively high leverage levels particularly given the risk profile of the portfolio realized and unrealized losses on the portfolio have increased over the last  months as has the proportion of the portfolio on nonaccrual status fitch believes further portfolio valuation declines are likely given market volatility and commodity price movements which will pressure already high leverage levels dividend coverage could decline given contraction in the interestbearing portfolio lower origination volume and the potential for additional investments to be placed on nonaccrual although will likely by cushioned by management fee waivers and offsets and an interest expense benefit despite these challenges apollo maintains a solid bdc platform leveraging its relationship with the parent company of its manager who has a strong track record in the credit space oil  gas investments accounted for  of the portfolio at dec   according to fitchs calculations which is the highest for the rated peer group in the first six months of fiscal  apollo recorded realized and unrealized losses on oil  gas investments including miller energy resources inc miller energy osage exploration  development inc osage and spotted hawk development llc further market movements or companyspecific challenges could result in incremental valuation hits in coming quarters and eventual credit losses particularly if oil prices remain at depressed levels fitch recently conducted a stress test on bdc energy exposures and believes apollos leverage ratio is one of the most vulnerable in the peer group given its outsized exposure to energy overall and oil  gas more specifically a stress on the overall energy book based on sept   balances yielded a  basis point increase in apollos alreadyhigh leverage ratio exposure to aviation amounted to  of the portfolio at dec   consisting solely of the firms investment in merx aviation finance llc which owns a diverse portfolio of used current generation aircraft apollo holds a first lien investment in merx with a  coupon in addition to  of merxs common equity fitch views the entire investment as a levered equity position as apollo is the majority owner fitch believes this investment is outsized which in combination with the cyclical nature of the aviation industry introduces more valuation volatility than a portfolio of first lien positions that are diversified by obligor and industry structured product investments consisting largely of middle market clos and creditlinked notes accounted for  of the portfolio at dec   which is above the peer average while fitch recognizes that a portion of these investments are driven by strategic partnerships like with madison capital where apollo has full view of the collateral in the structures the firm remains in the junior position of relatively highly levered vehicles which exposes the firm to more valuation volatility and potential loss further exposure to preferred and other equity securities represented  of the portfolio at dec   consisting of investments in renewables shipping and the ownership interest in merx amongst other equity investments while fitch believes the broader apollo platform has experience investing in these industries these investments are relatively new to the bdc platform and it will take some time to observe their credit performance earnings and contribution to valuation volatility given their categorization as equity exposures investments on nonaccrual accounted for  of the debt portfolio at cost and  of the debt portfolio at fair value at dec   which is above the peer average a second lien investment in miller energy and a first lien investment in magnetation llc and osage account for the vast majority of the nonaccrual exposure and are oil  gas and metals  mining investments fitch believes apollos nonaccruals could increase over the nearterm given continued pressure on commodity prices apollos leverage target is  times x at the upper bound at dec   leverage was x at par which is above the peer average fitch believes apollos leverage is high particularly given the firms outsized exposure to aviation oil  gas and structured products combined with limited access to the equity markets and the potential for incremental portfolio depreciation given market volatility and oil price declines additionally the average underlying portfolio company leverage was x at quarterend which is modestly above the peeraverage the recognition of additional unrealized depreciation andor credit losses would increase leverage thus pressuring asset coverage ratios since the establishment of the share repurchase program in august  through feb   apollo has repurchased approximately  million of stock representing  of initial shares outstanding this has yielded  of per share accretion to nav while fitch appreciates the motivation for the stock buyback meaningful share repurchases are viewed unfavorably given the firms current leverage levels fitch would view a reduction in debt via portfolio proceeds favorably fitch believes apollo has been successful improving its funding flexibility in recent years and  of its total debt was unsecured as of dec   however this is expected to decline to  on a pro forma basis following the refinancing of  million of convertible notes with secured revolver borrowings which occurred in january  apollo has another  million of secured term notes due in september  which fitch believes will be refinanced with secured revolver borrowings andor portfolio proceeds borrowing capacity on the corporate revolver will decline from approximately  million at yearend  given the convertible note maturity mentioned above apollos core operating performance is under pressure and expected to remain so over the remainder of calendar  interest income declined in the first nine months of fiscal  with a reduction in the size of the interestbearing portfolio an increase in nonaccrual levels and a decline in prepayment fees this dynamic is likely to continue as energy investments remain under pressure and leverage levels limit growth prospects apollos earnings yields remain inline with the peer group but are benefiting from the management and incentive fee waivers that have been in place since april  further benefits will be realized from lower interest costs given the refinancing of fixed cost debt on the corporate revolver and from management fee offsets related to the advisers subadvisory agreement with cion investment corporation net investment income per share continues to exceed dividends declared and in  will benefit from the refinancing of highercost debt on the corporate revolver  per share annually but revenues are likely to remain under pressure given current leverage levels and the potential for increased nonaccruals particularly in energy additionally cash earnings coverage of the dividend is likely to decline as noncash income like paidinkind interest is elevated compared to peers and could increase further with portfolio company strain furthermore dividend coverage on a taxable income basis is considered weak given the amount of realized losses recognized by the firm aggregating to nearly  billion since  rating sensitivities idrs and senior debt apollos ratings could be downgraded should leverage ratios not decline to a level commensurate with the risk of the portfolio a weakening liquidity profile deterioration in asset quality particularly in nonenergy investments material expansion of sector eg aircraft leasing structured product or industry eg oil  gas concentrations andor an inability to cover dividends with core earnings could also result in a ratings downgrade a revision of the outlook to stable will be dependent upon the management of leverage at a more appropriate level the absence of material losses realized or unrealized or credit deterioration particularly in the oil  gas portfolio structured products equity investments and  portfolio vintages which have been originated in a more challenging market environment a reduction in portfolio concentrations improved operating performance and an improvement in dividend coverage on a taxable income basis could also yield positive rating momentum

vital to us as the air we breathe between both old and young from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system without one people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies the vast majority of american adults    now own a cell phone this has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market of which itll is now becoming a key player with such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat this is where otc itll comes into play their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space since itll is a public company we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry we’ve done some digging and have laid out  reasons why we believe itll may be the most profitable stock play of  breaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements owcp   massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time theyre so common in fact we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations month after month for example in  alone weve already seen several major acquisitions telecom service provider gtt communications announced in june that it plans to buy network connectivity provider global capacity for  million in cash and  million shares of gtt common stock we also saw that in april windstream announced its plan to acquire cloudbased unified communications provider broadview networks in an allcash transaction worth  million and if that isnt enough in march zayo group holdings inc closed its  billion acquisition of electric lightwave the company formerly known as integra telecom all of this happened in just the last few monthsall this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether itll has what it takes to dance with the big guys well it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model big companies like verizon are making money hand over fist  why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usualitll has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive a similar situation took place in canada some years ago when a company named wind mobile came into play over a few short years wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition recently shaw bought them out for  billion as a result of all this our opinion of the itll business model is excellent  weve seen this business model work before   qb status and  stars from morningstar  this is a

privacy and never share your information with anyone  when going up against telecom giants a company has to hold a competitive edge to stand out through our due diligence we have found this to

its securities the information should not be interpreted in any way shape form or manner whatsoever as an indication of the profiled issuer’s future stock price or future financial performance you may encounter difficulties determining what if any portions of the information are material or nonmaterial making it all the more imperative that you conduct your own independent investigation of the profiled issuer and its securities with the assistance of your legal tax and financial advisor when rd parties that hire us acquire purchase and  or sell the securities of the profiled issuers it may a cause significant volatility in the profiled issuer’s securities b cause temporary but unrealistic increases in volume and price of the profiled issuer’s securities c if selling cause the profiled issuer’s stock price to decline dramatically and d permit themselves to make substantial profits while investors who purchase during the campaign experience significant losses the securities of the profiled issuers are high risk unstable unpredictable and illiquid which may make it difficult for investors to sell their securities of the profiled issuers we may hire third party service providers and stock promoters to electronically disseminate live news regarding the profiled issuers yet we have no control over the content of and do not verify the information that the profiled issuers andor third party service providers publish these third party service providers are likely compensated for providing positive information about the issuer and may fail to disclose their compensation to you if a profiled issuer is a sec reporting company it could be delinquent not current in its periodic reporting obligations ie in its quarterly and annual reports or if it is an otc markets pink sheet quoted company it may be delinquent in its pink sheet reporting obligations which may result in otc markets posting a negative legend pertaining to the profiled issuer at wwwotcmarketscom as follows i “limited information” for companies with financial reporting problems economic distress or that are unwilling to file required reports with the pink sheets ii “no information” which characterizes companies that are unable or unwilling to provide any disclosure to the public markets to the sec or the pink sheets and iii “caveat emptor” signifying buyers should be aware that there is a public interest concern associated with a company’s illegal spam campaign questionable stock promotion known investigation of a company’s fraudulent activity or its insiders regulatory suspensions or disruptive corporate actions if the information states that a profiled issuer’s securities are consistent with the future economic trends or even if your independent research indicates that you should be aware that economic trends have their own limitations including a that economic trends or predictions may be speculative b consumers producers investors borrowers lenders andor government may react in unforeseen ways and be affected by behavioral biases that we are unable to predict c human and social factors may outweigh future economic trends that we state may or will occur d clear cut economic predictions have their limitations in that they do not account for the fundamental uncertainty in economic life as well as ordinary life e economic trends may be disrupted by sudden jumps disruptions or other factors that are not accounted for in economic trends analysis in other words past or present data predicting future economic trends may become irrelevant in light of new circumstances and situations in which uncertainty becomes reality rather than predicted economic outcome or f if the trend predicted involves a single result it ignores other scenarios that may be crucial to make a decision in the event of unknown contingencies the information is presented only as a brief snapshot of the profiled issuer and should only be used at most and if at all as a

asked questions for starting a c corporation are nonus residents allowed to own a corporation or llc there are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a c corporation or an llc the scorporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders owner but any us citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder owner you would of course require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process known as the registered agent address but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a c corporation or an llc in what state should i form my llc or corporation unless you plan on having a large multistate operation it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is locatedgenerally speaking most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business andor a physical presence in that state if you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign out of state company with your home state which will subject you to all of the fees taxes and regulations of that state what are the differences between officers directors and shareholders a corporation consists of all three officers directors and shareholders shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders officers are selected by the directors and run the daytoday operations of the corporation these do not need to be separate people any person can fill all three positions in small businesses one person can be the only shareholder the only director and the only officer what is a c corporation a c corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation note the c in c corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code c corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations c corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to passthrough to the personal income tax statements of the owners as such c corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities c corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business if desired and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income c corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends but this can also lead to double taxation what is stock par value par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares it doesnt necessarily reflect their real value and is typically set at a low value ie one dollar or one cent the par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class the shares can be sold to the initial shareholders at par value or more but the price must be the same for each share not all states require a par value unless you specify otherwise incfile will authorize  shares this is due to the fact that  is easily divisible by      with a par value of one cent or at no par value if not required by your state what are bylaws the bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws bylaws are not filed with the
