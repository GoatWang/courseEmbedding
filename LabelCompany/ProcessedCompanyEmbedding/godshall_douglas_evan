chief financial officer and treasurer thanks chris and good morning everyone in my comments i will make reference to certain nongaap measures to provide a comparable understanding of our results to the prior year details on our gaap to nongaap results may be found in the reconciliation tables in our financial results release id like to start by highlighting some of the trends we observed in our business during the first quarter first internationally hvad unit sales were down  yearoveryear as expected sales in germany were impacted by the ramp up of heartmate iii among the top centers these centers which were interested to try a new device made fairly rapid switches from heartmate ii to heartmate iii in order to balance out their preferred  volumes even so the mvad system continues to be favored for implants which benefit from its smallness versatility and proven performance in other parts of europe the story was more about  in a handful of markets we dont have information on st judes geographic performance other than what was stated on their call two weeks ago from this we surmise that international markets including japan grew roughly  in the us i want to remind everyone that last august we concluded the enrollment in the hvad endurance destination therapy study this resulted in  fewer units being sold in the first quarter compared to last year overall our us unit sales decreased  including the impact of dt units and excluding dt unit sales decreased  based solely on our singlesided visibility it appears to us that the total us market was relatively flat yearoveryear reflecting a decline in the bridge segment in mid singledigit growth in destination therapy where we currently do not have a presence in the bridge segment our sales were impacted in part by our competitors ongoing ide trail but in general implant activity got off to a slow start this year although it has picked up considerably over the past six weeks were also seeing a trend where sites are choosing to pursue coverage for potential transplant candidates under a destination therapy indication given the more simplified criteria for reimbursement and their ability to treat first and list later with that back drop details of our performance were as follows in the first quarter we sold  units globally compared to  hvad units sold in the first quarter of  of the  units sold in the quarter  were sold in the us and  where sold internationally we added two new centers in the us and four new centers internationally turning to revenue at  million first quarter total revenue was  lower relative to last year foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately  or approximately  for the quarter geographically us revenue was  million also a decrease of  compared to the first quarter of  in which we reported  million in us revenue international revenue for the first quarter came in at  million down from  million last year which represented a  constant currency decrease from the same period in  gross margin percentage decreased to  in the first quarter of  compared to  in the first quarter of  reflecting lower sales volumes and total cost of  million in the first quarter of  related to ongoing field actions targeted to improve battery and controller performance of the hvad system adjusting for foreign exchange and field action costs the resulting first quarter gross margin was  this represented an approximate decrease of one point versus q and four points versus q of last year turning to expenses total operating expenses for the first quarter of  were  million compared to  million for the first quarter of  on a nongaap basis operating expenses were comprised of research and development expenses of  million compared to  million in the first quarter of  and selling and general administrative expenses of  million compared to  million in the first quarter of  nongaap rd decreased  million for the first quarter of  compared with the same period in  primarily as a result of lower project spending of  million and an  decrease in sharebased compensation expense nongaap sga increased  for the first quarter of  compared to the same period in  primarily due to increases in personnel costs and professional fees of  million offset by cost savings including sharebased compensation expense of  the moratorium on the medical device excise tax that went into effect on january  of  and  in all other expenses changes in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the  acquisition of circulite resulted in  of expense during the first quarter of  compared to expense of  million in the first quarter of  interest and other expense net decreased by approximately  million to  million during the first quarter of  compared to  million during the first quarter of  primarily due to favorable changes in unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses of  million and net interest income from our investment in valtech which was partially offset by an increase in convertible debt interest expense net loss for the first quarter of  was  million or a loss of  per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of  million or a loss of  per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of  nongaap net loss for the first quarter of  was  million or  per basic and diluted share compared to nongaap net loss of  million or  per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of  at march  we had approximately  million of cash and investments compared to approximately  million at yearend this decrease from the fourth quarter of  was primarily attributable to  million in aggregate loans made to valtech cardio in accordance with the terms of the business combination agreement in addition to operating cash uses which included annual employee incentive payments and incurred costs associated with the battery and controller field actions cash management always plays an important role in how we manage our business and we recognized with the delay of mvad and as a consequence of the loans we made to valtech in the first quarter that we will need to be even more dialed in on productive uses of capital in  with that we entered  with a narrowed set of priorities which include making corrections to mvad further enhancing hvads performance in peripherals and accomplishing early submission for pma approval of hvad for destination therapy as we progress through  investors can expect close and careful management of expenses and capital needs as we look to our performance for the remainder of the year were expecting continued top line pressure given market feedback on the early performance of heartmate iii compared to heartmate ii it stands to reason that other international customers will try out heartmate iii yet its difficult for us to predict how market share may ultimately settle out based upon early and somewhat mixed data as such we remain confident despite the nearterm market factors we discussed this morning hvad continues to have market leading potential at this point i will hand the call over to doug douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director thanks peter and good morning everyone just a couple of months ago in our yearend call we laid out our expectations for  and outlined our development portfolio we also set forth some very specific and targeted priorities for the year first we are seeking to further strengthen the competitive profile of the hvad system by accelerating pursuit of the dt indication in the us and by advancing a series of enhancements to the pump the peripherals and surgical tools second our field and support teams are intensely focused on defending and growing the market share for hvad and third our team has been focused on development of the most expedient path for mvads return to the clinic with enhancements that will enable the pump to live up to its potential as we indicated previously this past quarter was a challenge we also forecasted that  was going to be a transitional year with pressures on the top line but visibility into the precise trajectories in this market can be difficult to discern the lvad landscape remains ever changing which brings both challenge and substantial opportunity this is a market that is still evolving with clinical trials and new product introductions from one of the two players having a major impact on the space in addition to the normal variability and implant volumes making a smooth straight growth trajectory tough to achieve we did achieve growth for the most part for a six years span and plan to do so for at least another six years following this reset the upside to this volatility is this market is very much poised for growth with a substantial amount of runway ahead with just over  patients receiving vad last year there clearly remains an untapped market potential of tens of thousands of patients who could benefit from vad therapy we expect the number to continue to grow not just from absolute population growth and an aging society but also from meaningful technological progress in the field as we and others continue to innovate creating more sophisticated solutions that become better addressing the needs of this patient population both in terms of clinical performance and quality of life we have the capacity to open up broader market segments and drive meaningful and sustained growth for heartware the growth opportunities are on the nearterm horizon as we move ahead in our pursuit of a destination therapy indication for hvad system the us population of patients with advanced heart failure who are ineligible for a transplant continues to grow and theres enormous potential for hvad to have a meaningful impact in that market it is encouraging to see how eager our customers are to have access to the hvad for their dt patients this year we are facing the prospect of share rebalancing in major implanting centers outside the us and the allure of trialing the newest device available and gaining clinical experience both combined to temper hvad growth while this has been taking place outside the us the large trial enrolling in the us is also having an impact as it diverts potential new recipients of the hvad system to the competitive study we expect this trend to continue through completion of enrollment of the trial the challenge that we face as this market grows and evolves is pinpointing the impact that all of the myriad variables will have on implant volumes and by extension our financial results despite these pressures hvad remains the most versatile pump utilized in the widest range of patients among currently available systems heartware isnt just about a pump however it is also about our people the strength of our customer relationships is a hallmark of what makes us heartware and is a core component of our past and future success strengthening these relationships has always been very important for us but this year our marketing and sales teams as well as our executive team are putting forth an even more intensified effort to position heartware as the partner of choice for the heart failure cardiologists and vad surgeons around the globe recent evidence of this intensified customer focus occurred last week at the international society for heart  lung transplantation or ishlt in washington dc our team coordinated oneonone meetings group functions clinical investigators meetings and other events which were attended by more than  clinicians with recent changes in the market announced last week we see an even greater opportunity for heartware to be the singularly focused dedicated most successful lvad resource for cardiologists and surgeons heartwares leadership was on full display during the meeting as there were more than  presentations of data on the hvad system highlighting both clinical trial and realworld commercial experience heartware had a strong presence sponsoring two scientific symposia one on discussing hvad algorithms and another on hvads versatility outcomes and patient management the range of presentations over the course of the week demonstrates why we are so confident in hvads ability to survive and thrive once the new competitive landscape settles down a bit we are gratified to see one year survival in pediatrics at nearly  in  patients we witness the improving outcomes over time in our endurance study were reminded by many presenters just how flexible and enabling the hvad is as evidenced by many thoracotomy and bivad presentations we also were given a glimpse into the future of a potential smart pump which would be enabled uniquely by hvads advanced algorithms we were also reminded of the importance of our commitment to this field as we honored dr bud fraziers lifetime contribution to the mechanical circulatory support field and we were joined by over  of our global customers for the event furthermore while there had been a fair amount of expectations surrounding data from our competitors new device at the conference physician feedback was mixed with many striking a waitandsee position based on the early data releases these observations as well as many other presentations of data from around the vad world helps strengthen our confidence in our longterm competitiveness it also reinforces why securing destination therapy approval in the us is such a priority for us dt accounts for more than half the us market and approximately a third of the global market so it is an obvious opportunity for growth and with this approval we also should address and witness an enhanced utilization in bridgetotransplant as some of the larger destination therapy centers have been reluctant to adopt the hvad given the low percentage of bridge cases in their centers dt is also the major growth opportunity in the us so we cant wait to get the submission completed and to participate in this enormous segment of the market as we said on our last quarterly call we are planning to submit for dt ahead of time with data from at least six months to follow from the endurance patient dataset we expect well have full one year followup data on key endpoints from more than  of the patients at the time of submission were making steady progress in prepping the file for submission and are on track to submit to the fda this summer the vast majority of our clinical time and energy is being spent preparing the submission but we also have engaged in discussions regarding a possible cap and it has become clear that this cap or continued access protocol pertains to devices that are not otherwise available or that can uniquely treat a certain patient population in the case of hvad it is readily available and can be used for dt patients if the physician chooses but the ncd for medicare gets in the way which is really a cms issue not an fda issue were evaluating alternative options for studying the hvad to assess other hypotheses as we did with endurance and with our lateral study which recently completed enrollment we have a number of hvad related enhancements that we referenced on our last call that are well underway the first of which is an upgraded battery that is now rolling out and has received extremely positive feedback as has our software upgrade that is underway outside the us and both of these have been greatly improving the user experience with significantly increased support times and reliability we showed our nextgeneration enhanced controller at the ishlt and were looking to file for the approval later this year we have another – a number of other inprocess mechanical algorithm peripheral and clinical efforts for the hvad system that we will be continuing to advance this year and which we anticipate will create what our customers view as a new more advanced device in the coming years sort of an hvad ii as peter mentioned were being very mindful of our spend as we work through this transition year and we will be following through with strategic and highly focused investments in the months ahead research and development represents one of the biggest levers in our business that from an expense perspective can be up or down regulated as needed historically we have been heavily weighted in rd spend as a percent of sales expecting that the clinical advancements that are enabled by new technologies will be key drivers to our future growth we kicked off this year with a more focused project list than in the years past as we recognize the need to drive the key initiatives across the goal line this should have the dual benefit of managing our financials efficiently while still delivering on high impact product launches in  and beyond also working in our favor from an expense standpoint this year is the progress weve made in enhancing our quality system this has been a tremendous undertaking and the most significant volume of work and associated expenses is winding down now our systems and processes are in a much stronger position thanks to this effort we have made considerable progress on our path back to the clinic with mvad and were feeling very good about the enhanced tests we have created and their ability to simulate the clinical phenomena we witnessed last year this gives us even greater confidence in the likelihood of success when we do return to the clinic but more important than how we feel is how our investigators and advisors feel we have held multiple reviews of our work product todate and it is clear our technical and clinical advisors are much more bullish now than they were just a couple of months ago the potential for mvad to materially improve outcomes in an even more versatile platform is still a powerful draw for our customers as i heard over and over again at ishlt and they really seem to appreciate our transparency persistence and focus on getting it right we now have a very short list of possible enhancements and will be down selecting once a couple of our tests are completed at which time we expect to provide a timeline for our return to clinic as we look beyond this transition period we see a pipeline rich with new technological opportunities to advance and propel even greater growth the advancements that we have planned for this year in particular the early submission for the hvad system for dt as well as enhancements to the hvad system itself and steps were taking operationally will set us up for strong revenue expansion and overall financial performance beyond  our first encounter with the new competitor has been instructive and motivating it is confirmed that we are in a very competitive position as it is today and will be in an even more favorable position in the very near future as our enhancements begin hitting the market thank you for all your time this morning and operator we can now open for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session our first question comes from the line of jason mills with canaccord genuity please proceed with your question jason r mills  canaccord genuity inc great thanks thanks doug for taking the question can you hear me okay douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director absolutely jason r mills  canaccord genuity inc great clearly doug it seems a good bit of the volatility in the stock relates to the volatility in the commentary regarding the data both heartmate iii data and the hvad data and what weve seen in the data obviously is endurance which spooked people on the stroke side and clearly folks are trying to get their arms around both the oneyear data from heartmate iii and the stroke data that we saw at ishlt there and what might portend from the temporal data on hvad iv endurance so perhaps you could walk through the current contemporary status of the data specifically on the stroke side where it seems like most clinicians are focused and i guess the elephant in the room question again continues to be where is hvad eminently competitive at what stroke rate events per patient do you believe the endurance data need to show to be to feel like your reps can go out and fight very very effectively both internationally and in the us douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yes so were encouraged by the consistency of the feedback from folks who are actively monitoring blood pressure the results that they see confirm for them that their outcomes are better than what we showed at ishlt last year with endurance and that combined with our global experience with hvad gives us great confidence that what we will see is an improvement in endurance versus endurance so both the learning curve benefit and the blood pressure management benefit we dont have a specific the number has to be x for the hvad to be competitive and this is in part because as we heard over and over again and i know you heard over and over again at ishlt the flexibility ease of implant ease of use of the hvad combined with a very acceptable adverse event profile make it the device of choice – has made it a device of choice in every geography when it has the appropriate approvals obviously in the us we have the dt constraint on the competitive front i think the jury is out we really dont know what the data will look like with heartmate iii ultimately in a broader population so well see i think there was some puts and takes in their data based on at least how physicians told me they view the data and were very much focused on ourselves making our device better finding better ways to run our device collaborating with our physicians to run studies to confirm the benefits and attributes of our device and we think thats going to play out both in terms of improved performance of the current version of hvad as well as informing how we can further enhance the hvad performance into the future jason r mills  canaccord genuity inc thanks doug thats helpful and i guess just to followup on that though and push a little bit further clearly the heartmate iii one year data  what you started to hear from clinicians is some concern about that level of stroke and so following this industry for quite a while what you hear from physicians is a continual search for sort of the perfect device for an adverse event profile looks much better than the current generation even the heartmate iii data that we saw and what that seems to look like just in talking to physicians is a stroke rate thats much much lower than what heartmate iii showed seems like maybe  less and then thrombus rate similar to really what youve shown in the heartmate iii data is looking good there as well so they kind of want both so do we need that level of – that kind of an adverse event profile either out of the current generation of the hvad or improvements in heartmate iii or hvad  or down the line perhaps mvad to accelerate growth and penetrate a very underpenetrated patient population it just seems to me like that more improvements need to occur and i am wondering your competence in seeing that in hvad douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah so i think what we will see with hvad in current incarnation will be improvements based on better understanding of how to manage the device and manage the patient it would be hard to imagine a major dramatic change like all the events drop by twothirds thats just not probably achievable but we are certainly seeing improvements over time many sites are really delighted with the experience that they have with very low adverse events were nowhere where we want to be and i dont think were yet at the level we need to be to get to that sort of  plus patients per year rate that we all believe this market can bear were very intrigued by some algorithm announcements well be able to make with hvad that were working on that are inspired in part by our learnings on mvad and the decade of work that weve had on hvad so do i think hvad sort of the nextgen hvad will see a step function reduction in some adverse events yeah i actually think it will time will tell and well have to prove that do i think one of the reasons people were tackling me last week begging me to get mvad to them is because they see its potential to have a material impact on adverse events yeah i think that was – its not just because its such a small device i think they see the potential for that device to be a real game changer in terms of the overall outcomes we obviously have to prove it our first clinical experience identified an issue with suction and some thrombotic episodes but also saw some very intriguing benefits that have played out over time at least in a very small subset that hopefully well be able to carry forward once we restart the clinical trial jason r mills  canaccord genuity inc thats helpful doug i appreciate it one quick one and ill get back in queue on mvad since you ended with that you mentioned a short list of possible enhancements when might you have a more formal communication for the street and for investors on mvad will that be in  and can you provide any sort of more granularity as to timing thanks ill get back in queue appreciate it douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director i expect well be giving an update in  yes operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike weinstein with jpmorgan please proceed with your question michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc and i apologize im on a cell phone so my connection may not be great douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director no problem mike michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc so doug let me just followup with the last question on mvad so how do you get yourself to a point where youve got an answer on mvad i was actually aback by it just a comment of having a list of possible items that you could do to try and remedy mvad and just kind of came across as if youre not going to know what the solution is even once you start to implement something that is still going to be a bit of a guess as to what you need to do to upgrade the system douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah i dont look at it that way mike we had to create new tests – new test protocols a very different approach than what we used in the past because as you know with  pristine animal studies and no issues identified and all the traditional ways of setting devices on vention invivo they didnt detect what we then detected in the clinic so bad news is we got into the clinic good news is we think we had enough clinical experience that we think weve faired it out to carriers to focus on principally suction we knew suction was an issue and our suction response – it was a potential issue and it just turned out our suction response was not adequate so we are certain were going to have an enhanced suction response and thats being finalized now we have whats the as yet not confirmed is we have a definite suction response algorithm that well be implementing but there are some other intriguing potential additional enhancements that we just want to make sure theres no unintended consequences of making some of those changes so thats the process were going through right now its just evaluating a couple other things that are – we dont want to make so many changes that we end up creating a more complex interaction id say were  of the way towards certainty as to what were going to be selecting we just have to finish some tests to confirm which ones well do and they dont have any impact on timing because theyre all being run in parallel michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc got you and let me ask this the market commentary that you guys made early on just relative to the first quarter it sounded like volumes picked up in the last six weeks were you talking about bridge or destination or both peter f mcaree  senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer just from our perspective mike so unfortunately thats the only visibility we have but from our perspective  picked up in the quarter michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc and thats great but were you differentiating between the two either bridge or destination douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director no michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc okay let me just try and get to kind of what comes next so as we play forward to this year and obviously the market share settle out assuming that your data from the endurance trial is beneficial is constructive can you just walk through what your strategy is going to be to try and recapture market share not just in the us but internationally so assuming at the end that youve got a data set you can run with douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah and were not rolling over now in terms of market share physicians want to try a new device understood physicians want to get their own experience itll be very interesting to see what the – once they have a body of experience how sticky that new share disposition turns out to be we get some very favorable feedback from some centers and some mixed feedback from other centers so we really dont know yet how well the new device is going to be in a broader longer experience the versatility utility of mvad continues to be something that resonates extraordinarily well with customers weve had some whove already migrated back to hvad from a low watermark just a couple of months ago just because of the – they cant do everything with heartmate  that they had hoped to be able to do so we have a sustainable advantage on size and versatility which we fully expect will continue to accrue our benefit assuming that our destination therapy data shows improvement over our prior destination therapy data and is a new more useful clinical trial data set you better believe were going to use that extensively so were always looking for new opportunities and right now i would say the – our waveforms our log files our versatility of our system are extraordinarily attractive to both surgeon and cardiologists and have many sites internationally at least particularly after they saw the data at ishlt pausing to wonder why they would choose to use the new device and were certainly going to do everything we can to prevent them from having a desire to do so michael weinstein  jpmorgan securities llc understood thank you doug i appreciate it douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen as we move through the questions we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one followup our next question comes from the line of bruce nudell with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question imron shahzad zafar  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey good morning this is actually imron zafar in for bruce thanks for taking my question douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director hi imron imron shahzad zafar  suntrust robinson humphrey inc i wanted to ask specifically about thrombosis i know you mentioned doug earlier that theres a variety of considerations in device selection but just given the ce mark performance with heartmate  i just wonder how low do you think the pt rate requiring pump exchange can be brought down with medical management and without the need for a pump exchange just in terms competitiveness with the performance of heartmate  in that trial douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director so i assume youre speaking of hvad as it is today we see on average probably about a  –  to  pump exchange rate but we also see many centers that are substantially lower than that and part of that is how they i think regulate the patients and how they manage the patients part of it is how they implant the device and were really seeking as we look forward and as i implied in my earlier comments as we think about okay so if were not going to do a continued access protocol lets go to another study and we are looking at soon commencing a couple of new studies one is looking at antiplatelet optimization another is looking – partnering with the university of chicago in a multicenter study looking at hemodynamic optimization where they are seeing substantial improvements in rehospitalization rates with their hemodynamic optimization protocol and we want to test that in a broader set of centers because theyre also experiencing fewer overall complications inclusive of pump thrombus so we expect we will see declining rates of pump thrombus and we are certainly in parallel with – focusing on that with mvad we are also testing some hypotheses with hvad so a key component of our hvad pipeline will be further enhancement around the pump thrombus area so i suspect were going to see overall decline in thromboembolic rates with the sort of nextgen hvad although the currentgen hvad is already very competitive across the broad spectrum of adverse events right now that one particular adverse event of pump thrombus is sort of the one hook that the competitor device is hanging on imron shahzad zafar  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you and then as you look ahead to the expected approval for heartmate  in the shortterm indication is your sense that theres going to be a much broader use of that device in the dt segment off label just given the performance of that in the european study douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director so weve only seen  patients of data and we hear all sorts of anecdotal data good and bad so i really dont know what sort of a bigger trial in a normal vad population not sort of the very less sick population they studied internationally to see sort of how the device really performs so time will tell and time will also tell what their labels going to look like what reimbursements going to look like for this concept of a shortterm indication i dont know what constraints will be placed into that label or whether therell be an ncd or theyll try to go to local medicare carriers its really too early to say both in terms of what their data looks like what the label looks like and what payment looks like we are – we cant wait to get our own dt label and the clinical pull for that – for our device including folks whove used lots of heartmate iiis in the trial is gratifying and motivates us to keep working as expeditiously as possible to get our filing in place imron shahzad zafar  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay great thank you very much douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director youre welcome thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of danielle antalffy with leerink partners please proceed with your question danielle j antalffy  leerink partners llc thanks so much good morning doug and everybody just a question doug on the international performance i was wondering if you could give any clarity on where we are in the market share loss trajectory here so maybe one way to get at that is if you could give some color on how many high volume heartware centers maybe we could specifically focus on germany are still predominantly heartware that could default to heartmate iii here in the nearterm im just trying to get a sense of how much more incremental share loss there might be at some of these high volume centers douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yes so there are four big german centers which are we think fairly well progressed in their adoption of heartmate iii and so our plan is for that device to now be at its maximum share in those sites and to move it back in the other direction if at all possible if their clinical performance is on par with hvad that will be challenging because those sites do generally have a bias towards fair share or equal share whenever possible unless one device has just fundamentally better performance for them as the hvad did so it was great while it lasted for us because we tilted so heavily – we tilted them so heavily in our direction because of the superior outcomes they were getting with hvad theyre assessing whether they can get equal or hopefully not better outcomes with the new device so i dont anticipate that well see a meaningful share erosion at those sites and because they are so much larger than any other sites internationally and we did such a healthy business with them its why we saw such a sort of overall share shift internationally as quickly as we did because they delivered a disproportionate percentage of our business relative to other centers there are other centers and other geographies whove not trialed the device yet some have looked at it and decided they dont see based on the data and their experience with hvad any reason to trial the device im sure our competitors is not going to take no for an answer at least not initially but were encouraged that in both german centers and nongerman centers theres a reluctance to try the new device based on the superb experience and support theyve got with heartware i dont think were done losing share just because the device hasnt rolled out everywhere people are going to want to try it and the larger centers were not anticipating unless our performance is just fundamentally better than we perceive it to be were not expecting those centers to move in the wrong direction danielle j antalffy  leerink partners llc okay thats helpful thank you and just one followup on that thinking internationally now again are there still new geographies that could come online that could help offset some of that share loss are we in a situation where really youll still bleed some share from here and your performance is going to be driven largely by market growth douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director we continue just to explore new geographies and new sites within existing geographies until this year we have always been surprised pleasantly by how many sites we add every quarter it did slowdown a little bit last quarter relative to some of the really robust growth weve seen historically in terms of site adds but each site weve added over the past couple of years by and large has been a very small contributor that is a longterm project for us whether its a country that has just started doing vads or a site that has just started doing vads they tend to start with a handful of patients in the first year and we try to build from there we are – i just met with some group of physicians from a new country that will be coming online very shortly they talk a big game but i think theyll be like most countries where theyll trial a little bit to see how it goes make sure they get paid and the real contribution probably occurs in  danielle j antalffy  leerink partners llc okay thanks so much douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt taylor with barclays please proceed with your question matthew taylor  barclays capital inc good morning thanks for taking the question i just wanted to clarify one thing so you talked today about enhancements and being able to submit for the dt approval on an accelerated timeline the last time we have talked you werent  sure that the fda was going to accept that i guess can you just talk about your confidence there and whether you know for sure that youre going to be able to submit for dt early douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah so we feel very good about our device performance and that with proper patient management that our device in the combined trials should demonstrate that the overall experience with hvad is at least equal with heartmate ii in that population which in theory is sort of the concept between – behind a noninferiority trial and we continue to believe that filing on six month data with a large cohort of  month outcomes in a supplemental cohort which again is supplementing the real trial the two year trial will demonstrate that we no longer have an exposure and issue with stroke relative to the heartmate ii particularly when taking into context of the overall performance of the devices and the advantages of one over the other so our intention is to file on six month data weve met with our investigators very recently and they seem to agree – although they dont see the data they do agree that as soon as we get this approved and into their hands that it would be greatly preferred to waiting provided that theres is no downside what the fda will not give you in these kinds of situations is a red light green light theyre not going to say oh sure well approve it even though we havent seen the data or theyll just warn you in cases like this to say well you really have to do a lot of analysis youll have to be able to defend our statistics et cetera and so our expectation is well be able to defend our statistics our expectation is that we will prove our thesis that improved management of these patients delivers a device that is no longer inferior on the stroke side and then when blended with the totality of experience in both trials that that would then be approvable we have no idea if six month or  month data would require a panel so its hard to say – in either case given its two trials its different than other approaches its hard to know if the data is compelling as we certainly hope it will be then well get approved sooner we believe either way were going to get approved for dt matthew taylor  barclays capital inc okay and just to followup on your earlier comments i guess if you could explain conceptually in the prepared comments you talked about the btt volumes slowing and i didnt understand why that would be the case is that just something that youre saying was an observation or is there a market force there that you think is pushing that on btt volumes douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah so theres a path of least resistance phenomenon with the national coverage determination from cms from a few years ago which didnt have an immediate effect but if you have a patient and they have to be listed theyre medicare they have to be listed for transplant and youve got a group at the hospital that have to chime on whether a patient is listable or not if it takes considerable effort to get through your listing process there are times when youll just say is it worth the extra few days of effort to try to get this patient listed or do i just tell him dt and so the grey zone bridge to decision patients who still – many of them flow our way it does take more work and so theres a sort of dt by default phenomenon that happens when busy centers busy physicians am i going to go through all this trouble or there is a real impediment to listing like the patient smoked last week – oh shoot i cant list you now you just smoked and so while private payers will generally still – almost all of them will still pay for unlisted patients as bridge some hospitals will say lets just make a clean line if theyre listed theyre bridge if theyre not listed theyre dt and then its harder and harder for the physicians in those centers at least to call that patient bridge matthew taylor  barclays capital inc great thanks a lot douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bob hopkins of bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch thanks good morning appreciate you taking the question so just a quick followup from something you said on the last quarter call about market share outside of the united states i think last quarter you said that over the course of  it wouldnt be unreasonable to suggest that you might lose doubledigit or roughly  points of market share relative to where you exited  so i guess now that youre a quarter in i was wondering is that still guidance that youre comfortable with douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah and ill peter answer just to defend peter we didnt actually put a number we just said doubledigit peter f mcaree  senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we said doubledigit growth overall yeah our rough cals  – and again its very hard because we dont have geographic splits at all but it appears to us that were sort of approaching the number you cited  or so and as doug said there is a potential with them not having yet fully penetrated outside of the top centers that that number can continue to creep so i think our comment still is relative robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch okay i guess i think is what im really getting at sort of qualitatively and quantitatively is are things worse than you expected thats really what im trying to get a sense for or are you seeing signs of stability in the ous market share that give you comfort that what you said last time isnt going to be worse and i thought – i know you said double digits but i thought you kind of meant around  points so im just trying to – what im trying to really trying to get at are things worse in your view relative to what you thought theyre going to be douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director no theyre not worse they are pretty much in line with where saw them trending well its unfortunate is the confluence of events that make the numbers look worse we had really spotty body implant volume in some geographies that had no competitive activity we just didnt get cases so we had a combination of lumpy end competition whereas in prior years there would have been angst on the street about wow its lumpy does this mean its a trend and then we got compounded with and we had the share loss that we sort of were thinking we might have and it proved to be true so that double dip frankly both in the us and internationally more so internationally we saw this lumpiness but there were certain geographies where we do extraordinarily well in the us and they didnt have a lot of cases this past quarter so we know dont want to say everything is rosy and its going to go back to where we were last year because we know thats not true there is a new competitive phenomenon internationally and a big trial in the us but it is not worse than we expected its sort of in line with our expectation robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch okay and weve all seen volatility in market growth rates in the lvad market over the years so im just curious what youre seeing in the us and the bridge market and what youre seeing internationally is there something unique about what youre seeing this particular quarter or would you just put this in the bucket of this is similar to what weve seen in the past im just wondering if theres something we can specifically talk about this sort of a cause and effect here douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director id say the ncd effect is something that has been a creeping phenomenon that we are now aggressively fighting back against in the us doctors want to use our device we need to arm them so they can but its not too much effort for them to use our device that its worth their while so one of the initiatives that were kicking off right now is a real focused effort to make sure folks are armed to efficiently make the argument with private payers that hvad their device of choice is the one that they can use for the appropriate patients so id say that is a – that has been an evolving trend which were going to push back against and we think we do have some ability to push back against and internationally its the lumpiness plus the obvious change of a new entrant robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch great peter f mcaree  senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer id add to what doug said in terms of the us that the ncd effect that he spoke of but there was – to start the quarter just a real burst of implants activity and again for us its a btt  label only it feels very pronounced this quarter – this last quarter robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch okay i appreciate the color guys thank you peter f mcaree  senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen with wells fargo please proceed with your questions lawrence biegelsen  wells fargo securities llc okay guys thanks for taking the question so one on endurance one on mvad on endurance doug on the last call we talked about presenting data in the second half of this year can you give us an update on that and the endpoint being measured if someone has a stroke  weeks after the event how does that factor into the endurance presentation potentially being pushed into  and then i had a followup on mvad douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah we our customers our sales people we all want to get this data out as quickly as possible weve got to get it right its got to be clean we are in discussion with our investigators as to sort of when is the data going to be done and locked and submitable and do you submit – do you present on the – its basically the dataset that gets submitted or is it more appropriate to present on the full trial endpoint which would come to your point the patient reaches a followup in august but there is a potential if there are late events in either arm that you would still have some lingering closeout that youd have to do so that is a subject of much debate we havent put a pin in which meeting we would be presenting in as there is some debate but it is not lost on us that  would be the preferred year to present lawrence biegelsen  wells fargo securities llc do you have any level of confidence that you can present it in  doug douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director weve not put a pin in which meeting were going to be presenting it in lawrence biegelsen  wells fargo securities llc right then on mvad i guess the question we tend to get asked is do you expect it to need a redesign or – which would take multi quarters or years versus minor enhancements thatll allow you to go back to the clinic in a short period of time are those two options still being considered doug among the enhancements that you talked about earlier and is there – are you signaling on this call that a redesign is more likely and people should expect it to just take longer any color on that would be helpful thank you douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah the team has made extraordinary progress the hardest part and we talked about this before the real challenge was can you replicate the phenomenon in the clinic because we didnt catch it the first time and theyve done really great work to date and have particularly over the past three months really hit their stride and if you just sat through the last review we had a couple of days ago with our investigators theyre ready to put it in now well weve got to finish the tests and as i think about a major redesign to me a major redesign is were changing the impeller were changing the blood path we dont see any justification any reason based on our testing that we would need to do that so i dont see a major redesign as that is defined two are we still going to need to run animal studies to confirm that these design changes are appropriate yes from a regulatory perspective well need to run the animal studies i think our bench work that were doing is now far more informative than our animal studies and gives us a very high level of confidence that we are on the right track with a – with modifications we still havent finalized from the very short list of a few are we going to take all three or four or are we going to take a couple of them and were integrating clinical and technical feedback from outside folks users and otherwise but at the end of the day its really going to be our testing thats going to inform which ones we include and so is it – will we be submitting in the next quarter no we wont be submitting in the next quarter because weve still got to do the work and throw it into an animal are we narrowing in and getting very close to driving this to closure yes yes we are lawrence biegelsen  wells fargo securities llc thanks for taking the questions guys douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director yeah operator thank you ladies and gentlemen our last question comes from the line of chris pasquale with guggenheim securities please proceed with your question chris t pasquale  guggenheim securities thanks doug i just wanted to followup on larrys question on mvad so i mean at this point is it a foregone conclusion that youre basically starting over from square one here or do you think that theres any way for you to leverage the work you did previously to shorten the potential time to market at all douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director so i think youre implying are we going to start a new study or are we going to try to bolton to the old one i think the most prudent path is to start a new one youve got enough events in that cohort that youd rather not burden your final study report with several events and try to explain them away i think we are – on the flip side you asked if were going to leverage it we are leveraging it every day and very heavily luckily weve still got several patients who are doing knock on wood extraordinarily well with each base study day  it gives us great confidence that were really really close to having an extraordinary device and that these modifications were making to address the events that have been discovered in this initial clinical experience should put it over the goal line in terms of delivering the kind of performance that we had all hoped for – we were going to hit with the first effort i think the first effort taught us a lot and that combined with the new enhanced testing were doing should lead to the game changer kind of device that were all hoping and believing mvad would be chris t pasquale  guggenheim securities okay and then you completed enrollment in the lateral study last week thats obviously not the top of your priority list right now but can you talk about what kind of impact the addition of the thoracotomy label could have is that an important enough issue for clinicians that you think you can leverage it to create a competitive advantage douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director it is a big deal its actually even a bigger deal internationally than i appreciated where our physicians are now saying hey wed really love for you to do a study over here on thoracotomy or if you dont need a study get a label over here on thoracotomy it would help us help us with payers help us to market our practice we just recently had a center go through training for that very reason they want to start marketing their practice as a minimally invasive vad center and so it does matter and – in fact more than i expected because in theory you can always do a thoracotomy if you want but its increasingly evident that having it on label will be a meaningful advantage for us chris t pasquale  guggenheim securities okay thanks doug douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we come to the end of our time allowed for questions today im going to turn the floor back over to the company for any final remarks douglas evan godshall  president ceo  executive director thank you very much and thanks everybody for your questions i apologize i know there were still some folks in queue but we wanted to make sure we moved along expeditiously today we are thrilled with the progress were making on nextgeneration hvad nextgeneration mvad and even more delighted by the outpouring of goodwill and reminder of just how strong the many years of relationship building weve done has been for us and as one of i think the second largest vad center in the us said to me as he was leaving the meeting on saturday this was an amazing week for heartware and i think the amazing week for heartware at ishlt last weeks is really the start of the beginning of a really transformative era for heartware so thanks everybody for your time and we look forward to seeing you operator thank you this concludes todays teleconference you
