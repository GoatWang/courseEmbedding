click here  tea is produced in  it is compressed into g of tea cake this tea gives very distinctive fruity flavor the tea was grown at the north of lin cang   du mu chun comes from the north part of wu liang shan the north part of wu liang shan is the arid zone a lot of cactus growing around the tea garden the tea tree of du mu chun aged more than a few hundred years and it is grown without fertilizer due to severe drought tea grows very slow and its flavour is highly concentrated this tea has a unique flavour that reminds us of citrus spice or sometimes even prunes it also gives light floral flavour reminiscent lily flower or fresh honey because of its strong and uplifting aroma many people misunderstand that this is oolong tea many customers enjoy this tea when it is fresh nevertheless keeping tea for a few years may produce interesting outcome too in yunnan sometimes we come across puerh tea that gives very strong flavour like du mu chun to find this tea often need some luck i have brewed this tea in different places such as china malaysia and japan the flavour differs a lot depending on the water we use it sometimes gives floral fragrance and sometimes its flavour is fruitier du mu chun will have considerable body with modest aftertaste its simply delicious with no astringency it is a good choice as a daily drinking tea   the northern part of wu liang shan the river down there is the mekong river this river starts in tibet passes thailand and flows until pacific ocean once upon a time mekong river had been used for logistics purpose when tea was traded to neighbouring countries as you can see in the photo the soil in this area is not fertile at all and very rich in red soil this type of extreme environment is rather good for the teas quality       we mainly focus in tea from lincang and we seldom buy tea from xishuangbanna the three main production areas of puerh tea is xishuangbanna lin cang and puerh in these three places xishuangbanna is the most famous xishuangbanna has historically famous place such as yiwu bu lang shan or lao ban zhang in the past few years it took us more than a day to reach some of the villages these places were quite isolated and not publicly nowadays the access to these places becomes much easier thanks to the road construction in less than three hours these places can be reached many local visitors or even tourists from other provinces often visit these places since buying tea directly from tea garden is sort of a fun activity sometimes at the minority village located in the mountain of xishuangbanna we can even see the bmw or porsche since many people are rushing to obtain tea from these famous places the tea price keeps rising and yet the quality drastically reduces when the demand on tea tremendously increases farmers will find a way to increase the output to fulfil the demand thus they stop traditional farming and start applying a lot of fertilizer in order to increase the output these situation is really spoiling the quality of tea in the historically the famous production area for us we seldom purchase tea in xishuangbanna the tea is too expensive for its quality hojo focus in tea from lin cang from my point of view ling cang is a very ideal place for producing quality tea one of the important reasons is that this place is not welldeveloped some of the villages are at remote location and cannot be reached by car i prefer those minor places is mainly because of the tea tree is maintained at very natural condition since these villages are less popular farmers pay less attention to the output they leave the tea tree just like their ancestors way the tea plucking is only once a year besides no pesticide and no fertilizer is applied the only natural fertilizer is given by chicken only if the tea tree is very lucky chickens may drop a gift as they wander at tea garden in addition for the production of highquality tea lin cangs environmental condition is flawless first of all the total rainfall in lin cang is very low it is a very dry area indeed most of the land here is very rich in red clay and the altitude of the lin cang is very high due to these factors tea in lin cang grows very slowly and accumulates a lot of minerals once we tasted these teas it is very uneasy to reverse back to the previous quality the tea is so soft and smooth we can tell the difference even if we drink it while pinching our nose   why people are so crazy about puerh tea honestly speaking no matter how well the puerh tea is made or matured in terms of flavour it never is able to compete with the wellmade oolong tea  for example the flavour of phoenix dan cong oolong is marvellous i often say that oolong tea is appreciated because of its flavour while puerh tea is valued for its taste nevertheless there is oolong tea that gives good taste as well as nice flavour however please compare the price of oolong and puerh tea usually if oolong tea has both good flavour and taste the price is skyhigh as for puerh its flavour may not be as great as oolong but we can often find puerh tea that gives extraordinarily nice taste in this context nice taste is refers to after taste soft smooth thick and long lasting sweetness generally oolong is produced in fujian or guangdong province these tea regions are more open and betterknown so there is no more indiana john’s story puerh tea comes from yunnan province the yunnan province has less exposure to the outside world many small villages are scattered in the mountain some of them are not even indicated on the yunnan map only if tea buyer knows the specific place it is possible to find the extraordinarily quality tea at very low price we still stand a lot of chances to enjoy the fantasy of treasure hunting the flavour of puerh becomes very attractive if it is wellkept it may not be as perfect as some of the fine oolong but its flavour becomes very fruity and sweet like honey usually tea starts developing the honey flavour in  years’ time and fruitiness appears from  years’ time onwards i believe the best timing to drink puerh tea is within  years’ time however some people like aged tea that has been kept for  to  years i think it is personal preference   the point of selection for tea we purchased in  i would like to explain the point of selection for tea we purchased in  usually i buy tea from minority races they own the old tea trees inherited from their ancestors some of the tea trees have been there more than  years till today they practice very traditional farming if we require good quality tea it is very essential to purchase it from minority races with natural farming method the raw material quality is superb however the disadvantage of getting tea from them is their process control is less precise normally the panfrying of tea is carried out with wood firing with this method it is difficult to control the consistent or ideal temperature sometimes tea is overfired usually i am taking note of the overfired flavour and try not to purchase however if the tea base quality is extremely high and the price is very reasonable i will consider to purchase it is ideal to keep for further maturation high quality tea is refers to tea is very rich in polyphenols and this is the key element for maturation once the tea is wellmatured the overfired flavour disappears after ideal maturation the price of tea will be adjusted for puerh tea it is common that price is raised in proportion to the maturation period since these teas are less expensive one of the ways is to buy extra quantity and keep for some time in any case tea produced from the quality material is nice to enjoy even it is fresh although it may give slight overfired flavour it is sweet with very smooth drinking feeling here’s the list of our puerh teas  tea that is wellmade   bai ying shan raw puerh  bai ying shan raw puerh  da xue shan wild puerh  du mu chun raw puerh     tea that has slight overfired flavour caused by woodfiring   xian su shan raw puerh  xiu lin wu hao raw puerh  zhong shan raw puerh    xian su shan raw puerh has very marginal extent of effect from the firing process it is a wellmade tea from the extraordinarily good material it gives full body longlasting taste and very smooth texture with a lingering sweetish taste in fact you can enjoy this tea for now and do not have to wait until the tea is matured next to da xue shan wild puerh xiu lin wu hao raw puerh gives the strongest after taste among the teas this tea is so smooth and soft with flavour like sugar cane and honey although it has slightly smoky flavour like scotch some customers like this tea very much as they love good scotch zhong shan raw puerh is also made from very good material this tea was slightly overfried it gives a little baked aroma like bean tea garden and scenary situated near lin cang city if you wish to learn about puerh tea in detail please click here    raw puerh is the original yunnan tea   by far many customers associate puerh tea as tea with liquor that is dark brown in color and gives moldy or muddy smell in fact tea that has “brown liquor and moldy smell” is just referring to one type of puerh teas we call it puerh ripe tea puerh ripe tea is invented back in  it was produced with the microbiological fermentation most of puerh teas available in oversea market are this sort of ripe tea however puerh ripe tea is not the original puerh tea in yunnan province puerh tea means raw puerh the ripe puerh is considered as export tea most of tea connoisseurs me included seek for puerh raw tea although both teas shared the same name as puerh the puerh raw tea and ripe tea is completely different kind of tea in fact it is as different as comparing black tea and green tea this tea is produced by minorities in yunnan they were historically originated from south east asia most of their tea trees existed ever since long ago today these tea trees adapted into the surrounding natural environment and grew just like wild plants usually they go to the mountain to pluck tea leaves whenever they need to make some money for living the environment of the mountain where these tea trees grow is just like any ordinary mountain area needless to say no fertilizer or pesticide is applied thanks to the fact that tea trees were left to grow like wild trees and no chemicals were applied their natural habitat has a very efficient ecological system the pests coexist with their natural enemies thanks to no pesticide these natural enemies of pest can survive in adequate numbers to keep the pest population under control puerh raw tea has more than  years of long history and china is the only country that produces puerh tea it was originated from yunnan province in southwest china in yunnan the locals drink this tea on a daily basis in making puerh raw tea the quality of raw material has a critical impact on the quality of finished tea   what are the quality criteria of good puerh raw tea we noticed that many people thought that puerh tea is very special and different from other teas however puerh tea is also one type of tea there is no difference in its character from other types of tea no exceptional taken just because it is puerh tea  the quality of puerh consists of  elements    intensity of after taste good tea gives very deep after taste which allows you to enjoy the taste deep down in your throat the flavor of good tea stays longer in the throat and lasts for a long time this quality aspect has nothing to do with the method of processing the intensity of after taste is due to the minerals content of tea leaves usually tea produced from old tea trees or trees grown at high altitude will give much better quality and after taste    quality of flavour tea must maintain its fresh flavour as a matter of fact most of puerh teas were stored under inappropriate environment where the humidity tends to be very high as a result tea loses its fresh flavour and instead it gives oxidized and sour flavour many people misunderstand that this sort of oxidized flavour as the flavour of “aging” in fact puerh tea that has undergone proper aging naturally gives a fresh fruity flavour   astringency tea that gives bitter or astringent taste indicates that it is not early spring tea they are plucked either during end of spring or summer usually those teas are classified as lower quality spring tea is high in quality but the yield of early spring tea is very limited in a year thus majority of puerh raw tea available in tea market is summer tea which tastes bitter andor astringent many customers told us that they could not drink freshly made raw puerh because it was too strong bitter or astringent and therefore raw tea has to be kept for more than  years before it can be consumed in a way this is true but also not so true if the tea is made of tea leaves plucked in early spring it will never taste bitter or astringent in fact most people in yunnan like to drink fresh puerh tea produced less than a year only occasionally the locals in yunnan drink vintage puerh tea  if you wish to learn about puerh tea in detail please click here      if you wish to learn about puerh tea in detail please click here          brewing method  water   if you are using tap water it is necessary to filter the water using an activated carbon filter if not you wouldnt be able to enjoy the authentic taste of tea chlorine is added to tap water in order to sanitize bacteria this chlorinated water will also harm our body cells concerning about our health condition it is very important to remove chlorine from drinking water the most effective method in removing chlorine is to install an activated carbon filter this type of filter is designed for removing organic substance it will remove not only chlorine but also other harmful substance such as contaminated pesticide the activated carbon filter can be easily obtained from the common hardware shop in most countries if activated carbon filter is not available please place a charcoal inside the water and leave it for overnight the material composed of activated carbon filter is made of ground charcoal the difference is that activated carbon filter contains much finer particles and hence it has extremely large surface area for a better efficiency in filtration the intensity of after taste becomes stronger if water is kept overnight keeping water with stones or inside clay jar will increase the content of minerals however you need to confirm whether or not the water kept inside particular jar or with stone is suitable with your tea or tea equipment such as teapot if water jar carries certain minerals like copper or zinc it will rather spoil the taste and flavor of tea for this you need to confirm with experiment on try and error basis for boiling water please do not use aluminum or copper kettle it spoils the taste of water we suggest using kettle made of iron stainless steel tin or glass in the long run you may observe a thick layer of scale accumulated inside your kettle our mother usually taught us to wash and remove it with citric acid but please do not even try to remove the scale scale consists of minerals that exist in the water the mineral composition is reflected from the water you used if you remove the scale the mineral ion balance between scale and water is destroyed this balance is called buffer effect in science the flavor and taste will seriously run out and you wont be able to get previous taste and flavor for a long time it is also important to stick to the same type of water whenever brewing tea if source of water is changed it carries different type of minerals it will affect the mineral ion balance too   go to further information about suitable water for brewing tea  go to further information about suitable water for brewing tea   quantity of tea leaves use g of tea leaves for ml of water it means that you need g of tea leaves for ml of water  temperature   it is important to use boiling water please do not stop as soon as water is boiled it is advisable to keep water boiling for about  seconds to  minute  warm up teapot it is important to pour boiling water into the teapot and leave it for about  seconds without this rinsing process the temperature of boiling water decrease about  degree c when it is pour into the teapot  warm up tea leaves place tea leaves in teapot and pour boiling water again leave it for less than a second and discard the water and immediately pour boiling water one more time and repeat the same procedure without this step the temperature of tea will reduce nearly  degree c if  and  is not carried out your brewing temperature will be  degree c this is too low to extract sufficient flavor and taste please repeat rinsing process one more time please do not soak tea for more than a second brewing time st brewing a few seconds nd brewing onwards less than a few seconds you can brew up to even  brewing using the same tea leaves from nd brewing onwards it is very important to keep brewing time as short as you can as tea leaf is wet and hot definitely it is not necessary to brew more than a few seconds note please remove the lid while you are waiting for subsequent brewing if the lid is not removes tea leaves will be over steamed and get oxidized   in our opinion this tea taste nicer if it is brewed thicker we suggest to use more quantity of leaves than normal puerh tea brewing simple brewing method using gaiwan   firstly warm up the gaiwan with boiling water and then place tea leaves up to  of the capacity of gaiwan we use g of tea leaves for ml of water so if the capacity of gaiwan is ml we need about g of tea leaves please remember to place tea leaves gently and not to compress it into the gaiwan pour boiling water up to the level of tea leaves and then place the lid and immediately pour out the water from gaiwan repeat this action once more it means you need to rinse the tea leaves twice with boiling water this action is to warm up tea leaves and also to open up the leaves these actions must be carried out swiftly so as not to lose the precious flavor and taste of tea for the actual brewing it does not require long infusion like making other teas instead you have to brew it the touch and go style as soon as you pour the boiling water up to the level of tea leaves place the lid to gaiwan and then immediately pour out the tea without letting it soak it is recommended to accumulate the st and nd brewing into a pitcher in order to even out the flavor and taste for each subsequent brewing you just need to brew less than a second by brewing this touch and go style you can continue brew up to nearly  times if you wish to learn about puerh tea in detail please click here    note please remove the lid while you are waiting for subsequent brewing tea leaf will be over steamed and get oxidized if the lid is not removed   storage of tea puerh tea can lasts more than    years as long as tea is kept in dry environment before tea is kept it must be tightly sealed tea should be kept in ambient temperature and dry conditions such as in the living room and it must not be kept in humid environment like in the kitchen avoid enclosed area such as inside the cupboard or drawer as these places are damp also avoid opening the bag of tea in humid atmosphere it is recommended to open the bag during a sunny day or under airconditioned atmosphere once tea leaves absorb moisture deterioration of tea will be triggered within a few days tea will give an astringent taste and sometime it tastes sour its aroma also becomes weaker traditionally puerh tea is compressed to remove oxygen from the leaves and kept it intact it was the wisdom of ancient people to keep tea without oxygen and let it matured very well from scientific point of view oxidation does not only refer to receiving oxygen the oxidation also takes place when it releases hydrogen and receives electron even if tea is kept without oxygen it will still undergo oxidation in s generally puerh tea was compressed tightly and shaped like a bing flat and thin round cake it was called “iron bing” the tea leaf was compressed extremely tight until it became like a piece of stone we can hardly pry it even if we use the proper tool that designed for prying the puerh cake this style of compression succeeded the elimination of oxygen from the tea leaves if you have ever tried this kind of puerh iron bing you would know that it was very wellmatured it gives flavour like honey with fruity note and gives no earthy flavour at all the only problem is that it is so difficult to loosen the leaves from the iron bing and the leaves are often damaged during the process on the other hand nowadays most of puerh cakes are loosely compressed some of the puerh cakes can be easily break apart by fingers obviously there is oxygen remained in between the leaves  if we keep looselycompressed puerh in ambient environment tea will expose to not only oxygen but also moisture and develop unwanted oxidation that usually generates earthy flavour to achieve the same maturation effect like the iron bing we encourage customer to keep puerh tea without oxygen with modern technology we are able to apply the same theory  some people in taiwan intentionally keep high mountain oolong in the vacuum bag for a few years in the beginning high mountain oolong is green in colour and it gives a delightful fresh flowery flavour after a few years of
