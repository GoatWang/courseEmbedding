sensitive and more volatile than securities with shorter durations bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise mortgage and assetbacked securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates subject to early repayment risk and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations highyield lowerrated securities involve greater risk than higherrated securities portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not investing in foreign denominated andor domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations and economic and political risks which may be enhanced in emerging markets the use of leverage may cause a portfolio to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements leverage including borrowing may cause a portfolio to be more volatile than if the portfolio had not been leveraged derivatives may involve
