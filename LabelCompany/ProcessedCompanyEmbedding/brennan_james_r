edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide most scholars have viewed property in premodern ethiopia in ⁰́feudal⁰́₊ terms analogous to medieval europe according to them ethiopia⁰́₉s past property arrangement had been in every respect archaic implying less than complete property rights for unlike in modern liberal societies it vested no ownership or ⁰́₋absolute⁰́₊ rights in a single individual over a material object by draining any notions of ownership right historians therefore characterized the forms of property through which the ethiopian elites supported themselves as ⁰́₋fiefholding⁰́₊ or rights of lordship which merely entitled them to collect tribute from the subject peasantry by using land registers surveys charters and private property transactions which i collected from ethiopian churches and monasteries this dissertation challenges this conception of property in premodern ethiopia by arguing that ethiopian elites did exercise ownership rights over the land thus providing them a means by which to control the peasantry through the concepts of rim a form of private property in land exclusively held by social elites and zéga a hitherto unrecognized serflike laborers i explore the economic and social relationship between rulers and ruled that defined political culture in premodern ethiopia as a norm rim derived from confiscated peasant property and it mediated or exposed the social dependence of the zéga class on the ruling class rim together with zéga emphasize that the peasants were far less independent and secure in their property rights than conventional portrayals while indicating the ability of rulers to create a sharply defined social distance for the maintenance of a land tenure system that supported harsh exploitation and domination contracting with reading costs and renegotiation costs by james r brennan  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide in the economy contract formation and recontracting are costly and these costs have important implications for contractual outcomes and economic objectives like efficiency in this dissertation i characterize systematically how reading costs and renegotiation costs affect contracting behavior and i describe how thirdparty enforcement conducted by institutions such as courts might ameliorate efficiency problems associated with both types of costly contracting chapter i contains analysis of contracting and costly renegotiation using mechanismdesign the renegotiationproofness principle rpp is formalized any statecontingent payoff vector that is implementable with renegotiation is also implemented by a mechanism in which renegotiation does not occur in equilibrium the rpp is not valid however our more general monotonicity result confirms the rpps renegotiation is bad message because it shows the set of implementable statecontingent payoffs becomes larger as the costs of renegotiation increase in the model of chapter ii a buyer must incur a reading cost to understand payoffs sellers contracts promise an equilibrium with reading with reading exists in which the buyer reads offers with positive probability further monotonicity results characterize how the equilibrium depends two enforcement features increasing the lowest enforceable payoff reduces the equilibrium reading investment and encourages acceptance and reducing reading costs increases the buyers reading probability though the total reading investment is kept low i indicate several existing institutional rules that limit contract payoffs or reduce reading costs the penalty doctrine restricts private damages not to exceed harm substantive unconscionability effectively excuses performance for a low payoff and procedural unconscionability and disclosure regulations reduce reading costs in chapter iii interaction between a seller who offers a standard form contract and a buyer who reads itunder twosided asymmetric informationreveals reading costs are not incurred in equilibrium payoffbased limitations on enforceable contracts therefore play a vital role in agreement since any accepted contract will not have been read an example and general discussion relate expected surplus generated in a noreading equilibrium to contract payoff boundaries defined by enforcement youth the

panafricanism in ghana by jeffrey s ahlman  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide this dissertation explores the construction of the panafricanist and socialist discourse of kwame nkrumah⁰́₉s government⁰́₄ghana⁰́₉s first independent government⁰́₄during the nationbuilding project of the s and s in  when ghana became independent the country⁰́₉s transition to selfrule emerged as a watershed moment in african and world history as this small west african country challenged an international community rooted in the political and institutional framework of the territorial nationstate with a radical program of panafrican liberation and global socialist development by  the nkrumah government⁰́₉s commitment to this radical program had resulted in supraterritorial federations with guineaconakry and later mali while at home nkrumah and his convention people⁰́₉s party cpp presented the nascent nation as a model for a new form of modern disciplined and continental citizenship based on eighteen months of oral and archival research in ghana this dissertation reconstructs the development and performance of nkrumah⁰́₉s program of panafrican liberation and socialist development in the ghanaian public sphere in doing so it interrogates the role of panafricanism and global socialism in shaping a vision of a growing modern disciplined and socialist citizenry within the nkrumahist state moreover through an examination of the press youth women⁰́₉s and workers⁰́₉ organizations this dissertation traces how key groups of both ⁰́elite⁰́₊ and ⁰́₋ordinary⁰́₊ ghanaians embedded aspects of nkrumahist ideology into existing idioms of power corruption and progress in their communities as they sought to negotiate the increasingly volatile realities associated with life in postcolonial africa as a result i argue that through the institutional framework of nkrumahera panafricanist and socialist politics an interactive debate developed within nkrumah⁰́₉s ghana whereby an eclectic array of ghanaian men and women came together to debate and contest their changing places roles and responsibilities in the postcolonial nation such an analysis i contend provides a framework for understanding decolonization and nationbuilding in africa not as the elite program of political reorganization that most scholars have portrayed it as but as part of a dynamic set of local and transnational imaginings and contestations aimed at addressing the challenges and inequities associated with africa⁰́₉s

threedimensional cellular selfassembly by james r brennan  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide cellular selfassembly is a process that occurs during embryonic development in which cells and extracellular matrix ecm spontaneously organize into threedimensional d tissues in the absence of external forces cellular selfassembly can also be initiated in vitro and represents a potential tool for tissue engineers to organize cells and ecm in an in vivolike manner understanding the cellecm interactions that lead to the formation of d cellular structures will better allow tissue engineers to develop biological constructs in vitro for regenerative medicine purposes fibronectin is an ecm protein that plays an important role in tissue formation during embryonic development as well as d cellular selfassembly in vitro our lab has developed a series of fibronectin matrix mimetic proteins that mimic many of the cellular effects of the bioactive ecm form of fibronectin the goal of this work was use fibronectin matrix mimetics to identify the cellfibronectin interactions that lead to cellular selfassembly in this work we showed that fibronectin matrix mimetic substrates are able to stimulate fibronectindependent cellular selfassembly the fibronectin matrix mimetic substrate conditions that permit cellular selfassembly are dependent on the cellsubstrate binding strength we have identified roles for fibronectin matrix assembly and rac gtpase in mediating cellsubstrate binding strength and subsequently cellular selfassembly these findings were then applied to tissue engineering applications we showed that fibronectin matrix mimetics are also able to control cellular selfassembly of mesenchymal stem cells mscs and stimulate early osteogenic differentiation based on substrate coating concentration the studies presented herein suggest that fibronectin matrix mimetics provide a model for studying the role that fibronectin matrix assembly and cellsubstrate binding strength play in stimulating tissue developmentpages ivv new african histories  taifa  making nation and race in urban tanzania by james r

customeron july  format hardcoveras mentioned in another review this book is very heavily oriented toward the government sector the basic concepts of course apply to bb suppliers as well but it is difficult and frustrating to constantly have to stretch to relate the concepts and techniques to the private sector my biggest complaint is the authors constant use of abbreviations and acronyms i found myself having to keep a running glossary of his terms mtbf epr lsc to mention a few just to understand what he was talking about in general it is a good book for gaining a basic understanding of
