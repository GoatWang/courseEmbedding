included in the tables in this discussion of our results of operations are presented in thousands comparison of the three months ended march   to the three months ended march   net operating income we evaluate performance based upon property net operating income noi from continuing operations noi is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities or cash flows as measured by gaap and should not be considered an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions all companies may not calculate noi in the same manner we consider noi to be a useful performance measure to investors and management because when compared across periods noi reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations we calculate noi as net income loss excluding corporate general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization impairments gainslosses on sales of real estate interest expense acquisitionrelated expenses and other nonoperating items we define noi as operating revenues including rental revenues other propertyrelated revenue tenant recoveries and other operating revenues less propertylevel operating expenses which includes external management fees if any and propertylevel general and administrative expenses noi on a cash basis is noi on a gaap basis adjusted to exclude the effect of straightline rent and other noncash adjustments required by gaap we believe that noi on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to revenue and expenses management further analyzes noi by evaluating the performance from the following property groups samestore propertieswhich includes all of the properties owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of january   and still owned and included

the sale of our bayhill office center sold in january  one bay plaza sold in june  and  kearny street sold in february  properties a  million or  decrease in noi from our samestore media and

quarter additionally the increase in operating expense was largely due to higher occupancy and expense savings associated with a property tax reassessment in  the decrease was partially offset by an increase in rental revenues resulting primarily from higher occupancy and an increase in tenant recoveries largely stemmed from higher recoveries for current and prior year expenses attributable to
