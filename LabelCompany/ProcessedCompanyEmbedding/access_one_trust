zero trust server access securely connect to linux and windows servers over ssh and rdp through a pure client certificate architecture that eliminates the use of static credentials start a free trial how it works features technical specifications pricing documentation a more secure way to manage privileged access one of the most common attack vectors leading to insider breaches is static credentials blanket privileged access is given to anyone who holds the keys and its easy for them to fall into the wrong hands traditionally these credentials are stored in a vault or protected by some sort of rotation policy but like duct tape it’s just a temporary fix for a bigger problem scaleft designed a revolutionary new method of securely accessing servers backed by ephemeral client certificates limited in scope and time to each request the workflow is transparent to the end user providing the same experience as one would with traditional ssh and rdp connections scaleft performs the authentication and authorization behind the scenes with the supporting pki handled through a builtin certificate authority no extra configuration or patching needed works in any environment  cloud or onprem integrates natively with ssh and rdp enterprisegrade platform with dedicated support integrates with any identity provider includes builtin pki with endtoend encryption contact us to learn more why choose scaleft server access keyless privileged access you no longer have to worry about how to manage track or rotate those dangerous static credentials with a builtin certificate authority scaleft allows you to login to servers using ephemeral client certificates built for the modern cloud traditional pam products were built for a different time and it shows in their capabilities scaleft was born in the cloud with an architecture that better supports distributed teams systems and applications transparent end user workflow you can use ssh and rdp just as you normally would scaleft builds in the authentication and authorization workflows within the protocols themselves without any additional configuration our fresh approach to privileged access management users run the scaleft client on their devices to synchronize certificates with the local operating system and monitor state every request is authenticated with the identity provider configured for the scaleft team  active directory google apps okta etc the certificate authority built into the platform issues an ephemeral client certificate to the user scoped to the individual request servers enrolled with scaleft run a lightweight agent that manages local user accounts configures the cert store and captures event logs for every request the user and connecting device are authorized against the access controls  policies of the project and resource the client certificate is used by the scaleft client to initiate a secure ssh or rdp session with the server without additional configuration we deliver the most expansive feature set on the market builtin certificate authority scaleft operates its own ca as a component of the platform used to issue client certificates to the user on every login attempt each project has its own dedicated ca and performs the crypto on servers without an outbound network connection ephemeral client certificates each client certificate has a default expiration of  minutes and is scoped to the user and resource being accessed user and device metadata is injected into the certificate which is used as a pointintime attestation of trust for initiating secure ssh and rdp sessions bastion support users can route ssh and rdp connections over bastions to servers in private networks without having to use ssh agent forwarding simply pass the bastion server as a flag in the connection string and scaleft will make the hop transparently ssh  rdp protocol support scaleft integrates natively with the transport protocols themselves to ensure a streamlined end user experience and to provide visibility into the activities performed during a session this is done without any additional configuration or patching identity provider integration scaleft integrates with your corporate identity provider idp for authentication and to provide rich account management on both linux and windows servers this includes google apps and okta and we directly support saml or openid connect cloud platform integration the scaleft server agent integrates with cloud provider specific metadata services to automatically configure itself and enroll servers with the platform this saves time during deployment and ensures a seamless operations experience technical specifications client app supported operating systems mac os windows linux coreos ubuntu red hat centos fedora ssh

your property to others you make the trust document sign it in front of a notary public and then transfer your property into the trust during your life you as the trustee have complete control over the property in your trust when you die the person you named as successor trustee passes your trust property to the people you named as beneficiaries the main advantage of making a living trust is that unlike a will property that passes through your trust does not have to go through probate after your death this will spare your family the expense and delay of probate proceedings back to top do i need a living trust if you have valuable property such as a house or large bank accounts using a living trust to avoid probate may save your family time and money on the other hand if you have only a modest estate you may not need a living trust  a basic will may be enough depending on your states laws your property may be able to go through simplified probate procedures for small estates for

trust for example if you acquire new property and dont add it to your trust before you die that property wont pass under the terms of the trust document you can use a will to name someone to inherit property that you havent left to a particular person or entity in your trust you also need a will to name a guardian for your children for more information or to begin creating your will visit the nolos online will page at the nolo website back to top are there drawbacks to using a living trust the main drawback to a living trust is paperwork making the trust document itself is no more difficult than making a will but unlike a will you must get a trust notarized and you must make sure that ownership of all the property you listed in the trust document is legally transferred to you as trustee of the trust if an item of property doesnt have a title ownership document you can simply list it on a document called an assignment of property nolos online legal forms does this for you when you make your trust but if an item has a title document  real estate stocks mutual funds bonds money market accounts or vehicles for example  you must create a new title document to show that the property is held in trust for example if you want to put your house into your living trust you must prepare and sign a new deed transferring ownership to yourself as trustee of the trust back to top what other estate planning documents might i need in addition to a living trust you might consider making a will a health care directive to appoint someone to make healthrelated decisions if you

one adult child to pick up matters should we both be gone we wanted it to be as easy and inexpensive as possible for him to take care of affairs we first read the plan your estate book from nolo then

imagine spending hundreds thousands of dollars on an attorney when this was so fast and easy i own a business and have a child thought this would be complicated but i completed the whole thing in about  minutes what a relief posted on  review by anonymous i thought that the online form was easy to understand but with minor obstacles it would be great if there was a number that your clients could call to find some answers to simple questions that did arise from filling out the form overall it does save the considerable lawyers fees of seeking out an attorney posted on  review by

easy to use by anonymous efficient tool and gets the job done quickly posted on  great for a simple trust by anonymous i had a basic revocable living trust basically created the day i ordered this i did spend a week reviewing it before finalizing i think it is a great program if you need a basic trust if you need more complicated items it may not be detailed enough for example i considered putting some donations to organizations we support but could not figure out how to make sure that was done only after my wife dies i want to make sure she has access to all our assets if i die first its ok because i can find another way to make those donations outside the trust our trust is finalized now at a very affordable price considering lawyer could cost thousands of dollars posted on  very basic by anonymous very basic without a lot of options i made various customization by creating an amendment it would be nice if the program at least helped provide a way to amend it posted on  simple comprehensive and most importantly  valid by anonymous i used this to create a trust and transferred my house into it from an llc the process is quite simple using this online form very pleased with the results posted on  review by anonymous easy to use and seemed complete in all details is there a separate form for transfer of assetsproperty posted on  review by anonymous it appears to be a good trust but have not had time to activate until after we get our taxes done in early feb posted on  review by anonymous easy to follow instructions and best value posted on  review by anonymous this is premature as i havent yet completed the forms and process  but since you asked thus far i am pleased the much lower price and one personal recommendation prompted me to go with nolo rather than the competition ask again when i have it all done delays are on my end posted on  not what i wanted by anonymous not what i thought it would be i have an llc that i want to change to a trust and all your

words that inspire trust and how to use them in marketing posted to web psychology in ecommerce everything hinges on trust to be a successful marketer — whether in person or online — you have to be trusted something about you or your online presence must create a sense of trust in the buyer if they don’t trust you they won’t buy from you we could essentially reframe the entire marketing question into one of trust — how do you make users trust you why trust is so important the only person who will convert is a person who has trust in ecommerce trust is everything trust is a huge marketing category and one that branches out to dozens of subcategories just imagine the myriad ways that trust is required cultivated and encouraged here are some of them trust that the decision he or she is making is the right one trust that the product or service is the right one trust that the product will be of sufficient quality trust that the pictures or description of the product or service on the website truthfully represent the product or service that is purchased and received trust that the business or company is legitimate trust that the merchant is ethical trust that the delivery is ensured trust that the money will be received trust that the exchange will be fair trust that the technology for payment processing is working trust that the business’ profits will be used for good purposes trust that the business will continue to exist after the purchase for returnsexchangesservicewarranty etc trust that if the product or services turns out to be a disappointment it can be returned or exchanged or payment will be refunded trust that there are real people who will be able to respond to inquiries trust that those people will be reachable by phone email or other means trust that the people within that company will be able to speak in a language that the customer understands trust that the people are nice trust is important precisely because the entire purchase experience depends upon trust in order to be successful every conversion is an indication that trust has been won every new customer represents a person whose trust has been earned every return customer represents a person whose trust continues to be held without trust there is no such thing as conversions customers or revenue trust is the functional center for all of conversion optimization i don’t want to blow this trust thing way out of proportion but it’s a really big deal in order to encourage customers to buy conversion optimization experts focus on three main areas increasing motivation reducing anxiety reducing friction here’s how trust plays a role in each of these increasing motivation every user must have a degree of trust in order for motivation to be effective motivating factors include urgency likability consistency and incentives behind all of these is the need for trust reducing anxiety anxiety is the antithesis of trust the entire effort of reducing anxiety goes handinhand in  creating trust reducing friction there are lots of different types of friction many of these friction elements are created by a lack of trust the only way to reduce friction in such categories copy cognitive design etc is to increase trust that’s why trust is so important your livelihood as a marketer depends on trust and it depends on understanding earning and keeping that trust thankfully what we do and write impacts trust as reinhard bachmann wrote in the journal of trust research “if trust could not be influenced and indeed be deliberately created and shaped trust research would largely be a waste of time” the more skilled we become at creating and shaping trust the more skilled we become as marketers why words are so important everything i’ve written so far prompts the question — so how do i create trust with words “content is king” is one of the most agonizingly cliche phrases in the history of the internet but it’s a cliche precisely because it’s so true content wins the day in conversion optimization as much as it does in search engine optimization content is one of the most important features in creating trust in your users i’m not going to say it’s the only thing but it is one of the most important things you need to create content that inspires trust humans are driven by language the use of language is rooted deep within our brains humans are wired for language and operate based on language beyond its primal origins however language also has profound cultural moorings mere phonetics and pronunciation have an impact on the perception and profitability of companies to cite just one example george eastman named his worldclass company “kodak” because the ks made it a strong and pronounceable name  something about that voiceless velar plosive … image source stocks that hit the market with pronounceable and memorable names and ticker symbols actually perform demonstrably better when a landing page uses words successfully it is inspiring trust with those words even in the lifeonlife interaction of trust building words are important the wall street journal ran a piece about how leaders can inspire trust in a revealing way the five points the article expanded on each had something to do with language and words show that your interests are the same demonstrate concern for others deliver on your promises be consistent and honest communicate frequently clearly and openly each of these five points are directly related to using words and language and the article sums it up in the final point — “communication is also the vehicle through which the other four elements of trustworthiness are delivered” everything comes back to language words and the message … content the question becomes what words inspire trust finally i’ve settled on the entire point of this whole article — the specific words phrases and type of message that can inspire trust the list of trustinspiring words and phrases how did i come up with this list of words this isn’t just based on gut even though “gut feeling” is where a sense of trust often resides the list you’ll see below is based on several factors research believe it or not — trust me on this — there are entire organizations and branches of study that deal with trust some organizations even focus on specific areas of trust such as organizational trust some journals deal exclusively with the academic research on trust this research was instrumental in my developing this list other writers have developed similar lists of converting or trustworthy words phonology the very sound of words phonology has an effect on their usage understanding and trustworthiness as cornell researchers recently discussed in an issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences “the sounds of words contain information about their syntactic role … phonological typicality affects both the speed with which we access words in isolation as well as when we process them in the context of other words in a sentence” this reality has a profound impact upon the trustworthiness of given words for a long time researchers and linguists have concurred that “the sounds of some words fit the meanings particularly well” michael wertheimer the american journal of psychology vol  no  june  pp  the better the fit the greater likelihood of a trust response connotative meaning words also have meaning “meaning” goes beyond dictionary referents to the associations that we make with certain words this is an issue of semantic relationships and is perhaps the greatest contributor to the trustworthiness of certain words let’s take an example of how we move from a given word to a connotative association origin word slither this word’s very phonology has a sinister sound beyond that however we associate “slithering” with snakes connotative word snake snakes bite they are creepy most members of the general population do not have strong feelings of affection or affinity toward snakes according to the bible satan appeared as a snake to adam and eve conceptual connotation satan satan is the personification of evil the antithesis of good and the locus of all that is bad connotative conclusion the word slithering just feels bad or  negative denotative meaning the straightforward dictionary meaning of a word is what originally classifies it as trustworthy words that inspire trust are words that are synonyms of trust the meaning of a word stands as its own marker of trust authentic — people love authenticity we all crave something that is real accurate — accuracy can be very compelling since people are trained to be skeptical of information on the internet this word can tend to deepen the trustworthiness of copy ask — if people feel the freedom to ask and inquire it strengthens their feeling of trust even if they don’t ask anything just knowing that they can will help to create trust answer — the cognitive resolution to “asking” is answering thus the word “answer” has a ring of trustworthiness authoritative — we respect admire follow and respond to authority figures authoritative research and authoritative information the knowledge that someone or something is authoritative is enough to create a feeling of trust backed — the idea that something is “backed” brings to mind fiduciary trust and a gold standard we believe in it bestselling — when someone or something is “bestselling” it means that a lot of people trust and respect that product or the person behind it build — “build” is a word that we think of in relationship to a good work ethic and strength it’s definitely trustworthy cancel anytime — this is a safety net for people’s anticipation of buyer’s remorse “anytime” provides great flexibility being always available inspires trust certified — it really doesn’t matter what’s certified or where the certificate came from someone else trusted it data — how we love our data just the word data even if there are no charts to back it up makes us feeling trusting dependable — this is one of those words with compelling phonology in addition from a connotative standpoint the word sounds like “deep” “pensive” “able” these are words with trustworthy sensations running through them endorsed — an endorsement or more simply the use of the word is reassuring again someone or some organization already considered and thought highly of the recipient of the endorsement earned — another statement of work ethic and honesty people feel good whenever they or someone else “earns” something factual — facts are stronger than opinions facts back up claims and claims backed by facts can be trusted faithful — like old yeller or other iterations of man’s best friend we all like something or someone who is faithful guaranteed — a guarantee assuages doubt the guarantee is the powerhouse that drives many successful ecommerce and retail establishments this word is power give — people who “give” are people who are good they can be trusted genuine — this word is synonymous with “authentic” and “true” help — helping implies that you are not just solving a problem you are becoming a hardworking partner honest — “can you be trusted” can be asked in a different way “are you honest” honesty breeds trustworthiness every time ironclad — often paired with “guarantee” this word conveys a sense of strength and integrity identify — much of trustworthiness has to do with a sense of empathy or relatedness if you can relate to something — identify with it — you are more likely to trust it integrity — integrity is a character quality that demands trust when applied to products or services is inspires similar feelings lifetime — people are assured when they know something is for their “lifetime” this word gets personal and assures us of what most of us expect to be a lengthy future loyal — many have bemoaned the lack of loyalty in today’s culture if you can introduce this word you will create an oldfashioned sense of honesty and integrity that helps to strengthen trust moneyback — it’s another form of guarantee which demonstrates your trust in your product people like the idea of getting their money back if they aren’t satisfied use this word no obligation — people are afraid of obligation — financial or otherwise turn off this fear and turn up the trust with this phrase no questions asked — this phrase says that you’re not nosing into their business no nsa stuff going down here no risk — risk aversion characterizes many unrealized purchases this phrase helps to reduce fear of loss while ratcheting up the trust no strings attached — this phrase has a way of stripping away confusion and wiping away the mumbo jumbo of legal agreements it makes the idea of converting easier while assuring people that you’re straightforward and true official — something “official” is bound to be trustworthy oven — ovens have nothing to do with trust just seeing if you’re paying attention privacy — since consumers value their privacy so should you honoring privacy inspires trust protected — when used in the context of a purchase knowing that there’s some sort of protection makes skeptics become buyers through the conduit of trust proofproven — we’re more likely to trust something if someone else has put it to the test and proven its value recessionproof — want to fend off people’s greatest economic fear this phrase is for you relate — again back to the connotative issue people like something or someone with whom they can relate respect — respecting others helps them to trust you refund — like “money back” the promise of a refund makes it easier to buy since there’s no financial risk involved research — if you’ve done research or if your product has been researched knowing that it’s been “checked out” inspires trust results — people crave results more to the point they trust results science scientific — people’s belief in science has led them to trust anything that is backed that word by science secure — we all want security in every area of life if people can gain a sense of security through their transaction with your product or service it will help them trust you satisfaction — everyone wants satisfaction tested — people avoid things that are untested having the word “tested” indicates that your product or service has proven itself trusttrustedentrust — this is fairly obvious true — if it’s true it’s honest real something you can count on it can be trusted try — assurance comes from experience and experience is one of the greatest sources of trustworthiness unconditional — like “no strings attached” this word implies that there’s nothing hidden it is what it is people trust simplicity understand — the issue of empathy again comes into play with this word introducing a sense of relatedness and assurance verifyveracity — like “proven” and “tested” the fact that your product or service has been verified indicates that a third party vouches for its trustworthiness value — the word “value” reinforces the idea that someone is getting a good deal warranty — this word signals that you stand behind your product or service that you trust it is good that you promise some relief if it fails lessens the risk of a purchase you also i me my ie use of first person and second person — people trust people and when you indicate that you are a person you will be better able to create a sense of trust it has been said that “you” is  the most powerful word in the english language copywriters attest to the powerful nature of the word “you” in headlines and advertising copy use of the firstperson can also enhance trust when firstperson voice is used as in testimonials it creates a feeling of understanding and sympathy with the user a caveat i want to end this article with a caveat you can’t fake trust trust either is or it isn’t the very definition and reality of trust implies its genuine status words not backed by reality are meaningless a message that sounds “trusting” but is not backed by the trustworthy action serves only to emphasize how untrustworthy the business really is you can use these words — and you should — to shape trust but you can’t expect to build trust on words alone shares  jeremy smith conversion expert jeremy writes about conversion optimization web
