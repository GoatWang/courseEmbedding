strategic air command he completed his bachelor’s in aerospace engineering in  his master’s coursework in  and then received a national science foundation doctoral fellowship which he declined because of the poor aerospace economy in  woltosz later became a recognized expert in simulating and optimizing rocket and missile performance change came rocketing in  with the incorporation of words a

each advance signified a further unlocking of human potential—what had driven woltosz from rocket science into a business with an oldfashioned key as its logo the passion he had developed in aerospace for computer simulation and modeling drove woltosz to apply these technologies in health care landing on “simulation of oral drug absorption” a way to minimize animal testing failed clinical trials
