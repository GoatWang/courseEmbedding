overview sec filings news releases contact us about us  summary our company aurasource inc is a nevada corporation focused on developing and implementing clean energy and mineral processing technologies we are commencing operations with two hydrocarbon clean fuel technologies auracoal™ and aurafuel™ and a mineral processing technology aurametal™ auracoal™ aurasource inc developed the auracoal™ process which is a patent pending technology to remove sulfur and ash from the coal during a precombustion processing stage this process reduces energy costs and all but eliminates harmful emissions this proprietary clean coal technology produces a hydrocarbon fuel which contains only trace amounts of sulfur ash and thus a lowcost alternative to oil or natural gas aurametal™ aurasource inc developed the aurameta™ process based on its grinding and separation technologies this technology separates commercially valuable minerals from their ores economically and efficiently it has a broad application in metal beneficiation such as hematite which can not be concentrated by magnetic separation aurafuel™ aurasource inc has also licensed another proprietary hydrocarbon clean fuel technology aurafuel™ which utilizes a low temperature catalytic process to convert oil shale asphalt shale and lowranking coal to hydrocarbon clean fuel products in a highlyefficient manner  copyright

technology industrial demonstration core technologies auracoal aurametal aurafuel investors stock overview sec filings news releases contact us core technologies core technologies aurasource’s intellectual property portfolio includes ultrafine grinding and separation processes which enable the production of high value feedstock and a further reduction in cost for several industrial applications ultrafine grinding technology aurasource’s ultrafine grinding technology utilizes a fluid shock wave to grind slurry materials into an ultrafine scale the shock wave is generated when a pressurized mpa slurry passes through a grinding chamber the shock wave carries a large amount of energy which creates strong shear collision and cavitation effects thus causing particles in the slurry reduce to an ultrafine size as a result when used in conjunction with coal water slurry grinding the coal water slurry can be effectively pulverized and its fluidity improved the energy consumption of this technology is  less than that of the conventional ball mill process separation technology aurasource’s ultrafine separation technology separates particles with different densities in an ultrafine slurry the minimum particle size for conventional jigging and heavy media cycling is mm which makes it difficult to remove inorganic minerals the settling velocity of particles in the slurry becomes very low under normal gravity when particles are fine particles settling may even stop due to interaction force between particles and disturbances caused by ultrafine particles in the slurry therefore conventional coal preparation equipment doesn’t work this technology enables particles separation by applying a large amount of gravity force thus impurities and unwanted substances such as ash or sulfur in coal can be removed  copyright  aurasource inc all rights reserved aurasource inc publicly traded as otcbb arao home about us about us management strategic partners technology
