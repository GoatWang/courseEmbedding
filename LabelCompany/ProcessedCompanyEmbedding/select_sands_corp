market for selects northern white tier sand products in the oil and gas sector both in the permian and other areas located near arkansas is now in very high demand and the price for northern white tier silica sand is rapidly increasing after having been in a bear market from late  until the fall of  it is expected that this high demand and increasing price trend will continue for the next few years during the past few months select has transitioned into a rapidly growing operating company with commercial sales of its tier sand now being sold into the oil  gas industry after announcing on january   its first  ton sale of its sand into the oil  gas industry on march th the company announced that it had entered into a substantial longterm supply agreement with liberty oilfield services to supply  and  mesh sand products with volumes that will increase to more than  million tons per year by next year in my view selects share price has not yet begun to properly reflect the value of its assets or nearterm revenue and profit potential it remains very undervalued and has a substantial upside during the next  months which i will discuss in more detail below background select is a canadian company with offices located in both vancouver bc and houston texas the operating business is now effectively carried out of the houston office the shares are listed on both the tsx venture

  week range  market cap  million i was first introduced to select almost exactly  years ago at that time rasool mohammad was the president and ceo of select sands we met in my toronto office before i met rasool i knew nothing about sand and really had very little interest in the sand or frac sand business during our initial meeting rasool made a very compelling case as to why select sands had incredible potential the primary asset was an unpermitted  acre parcel of land in arkansas which contained northern white also called ottawa white finer mesh sand unlike the image of sand that i had in my head northern white tier  or  mesh sand once processed actually looks and feels like pure white talcum powder i still have a small clear plastic bag of selects sand sitting on my desk to remind me daily of my investment shortly after meeting rasool i started buying shares of snsv at cdn when the entire market cap for the company was under cdn million about a month later in april  rasool invited me to join the board because of my legal and board background i accepted his invitation in less than  years it has had a number of capital raises transitioned into a producing sand company and now has a market cap of approximately  million approximately cdn million in my view in addition to being undervalued based upon its current assets there are a number of upcoming catalysts which together make select sands one of my top picks for  it is currently one of my largest holdings select sands year chart in cdn trading on the tsx venture exchange select sands in us trading on the otcqx select sands assets the company currently has a number of assets including a sandtown property an advancedstage silica sand  acre property in arkansas the sandtown project or sandtown property it is fully permitted and recently commenced commercial operations according to an updated report prepared by engineering firm tetra tech in february  sandtown contains a resource of  million tons primarily finer mesh  and  northern white silica sand the details are set out in the companys press release dated february   found here according to a preliminary economic assessment pea completed back in june  prepared by tetra tech in relation to only  of the property  million tons there was an internal rate of return of  with a net present value of  million aftertax npv at  of  million based on revenues calculated at  per ton an updated pea reflecting the entire  million ton resource has not yet been done and may not be done b bell farm a newly acquired acre property bell farm located approximately  miles from the acre sandtown property the company believes bell farm could be a source of northern white tier frac sand bell farm appears to be underlain by the st peters formation and is currently being tested by an engineering firm retained by select to determine the quality and quantity of its frac sand the details of the acquisition of the bell farm property are disclosed in select sands press release dated january   found here c  acre wet dry plants and sand storage facility located on union pacific railway line a wet plant and a acre fully operational drying facility with storage facility located close to select sands acquired from tutle holding llc steve hackmann ozark premium sand llc ops including operating equipment saleable inventory and customer lists among other miscellaneous assets owned by ops the acre facility is located on the union pacific rail line which has allowed select sands transformation into a fully integrated selfsufficient tier  sand producer currently ramping up production at a ton run rate with upgrades planned this year to exceed the  ton capacity and with excellent logistics in addition the company is evaluating the possibility of increasing capacity with relatively low capital expenditure d  million common shares in comstock metals inc otcpkcmmmf tsxv symbol cslv comstock metals is a microcanadian mining exploration company with gold exploration properties located in the yukon saskatchewan and ontario as well as potential uranium mining stakes in saskatchewan the company is currently drilling its preview property in saskatchewan e approximately us  million cash or equivalents with no debt other than the usual current trade payables etc logistical advantage most of the type of northern white sand being produced by select sands is currently mined in the northern part of the us such as wisconsin for those oil  gas companies buying their northern white frac sand from wisconsin this creates additional shipping costs and time delays for oil fracking producers in the permian and other parts of the southern us who may need very large quantities of this type of finer mesh highquality sand as well freezing winters in wisconsin can halt production during the winter months hence it was an enormous logistical advantage for select sands to have its quarries located in arkansas with a month season and an approximately mile shipping advantage to the oil  gas fields in the southern us the map below taken from a select sands november  powerpoint presentation illustrates the companys logistical advantage in relation to the major oil  gas fields as well as the up rail lines increasing demand and higher pricing for frac sand in the us during the past  months the demand and pricing for finer mesh highquality silica sand in the oil  gas industry in the us has been rapidly increasing and there have been a number of recent articles in the financial and industry press discussing the phenomenon for example a wall street journal article came out on march   called latest threat to us oil drillers the rocket price of sand the article underscores the opportunity for select sands corp as well the other week the wellrespected energy investment and merchant banker tudor pickering hold  co came out with a presentation called dont sleep on the sand stocks frac sand supplydemand update and sand stock upside musings i have taken the liberty to include some of the slides from their march  presentation below which sets out the increasing annual us frac sand demand both historical and tudor pickerings forecast for  and  on january   select sands issued a press release that it had just entered into its first oil  gas frac sand order to supply  tons of sand steven goldmans march   interview with zig vitols president and ceo of select sands on march   i had an opportunity to interview select sands president and ceo zig vitols for more than an hour he also answered some followup questions for me i was going to provide a qa format for part of this article but seeking alpha no longer permits that format in its exclusive articles hence i will simply incorporate some of zigs important answers in the article march th announcement of multiyear frac sand supply agreement to surpass  million tons per year on march   select sands issued a press release here announcing that it had entered into its first multiyear frac sand supply agreement with liberty oilfield services of denver colorado initial rail shipments were completed in february  and are anticipated to continue throughout  with volumes expected to increase in  and  to surpass a total of one million tons per year the  and  mesh products to be supplied under the agreement will be sourced from the companys facilities in arkansas this is a major step for select sands and i wanted to speak to zig vitols about that new supply agreement liberty oilfield services is a midsized pressure pumping company based in denver colorado it is a very respected company and is always pushing leadingedge new oil field technologies zig thought it was run by wellrespected individuals and found that they were a pleasure to work with liberty oilfield is a private company zigs understanding was that it has about  active hydraulic fracturing fleets with each fleet generally having the capacity to service one well with typically anywhere from  to  trucks with generators or pumps or other large pieces of equipment and that the company is upgrading with an additional six frac fleets to meet their operational standards the finer meshgrade  and  mesh highpurity  sio sand being produced by select sands northern white tier frac sand  and  mesh is also ideal for specialized industrial uses which can command higher prices than the oil  gas industry but the sales are in much smaller volumes zig confirmed that select will continue to sell into the industrial market as part of its overall supply strategy but increasingly sales will be focused on the oil  gas sector ramping up to  million tonannum production in  in december  select sands announced that it had completed the acquisition of a acre fully permitted operational facility containing both wet and dry plant production facilities located on a tier  union pacific rail line which could process  tons of silica sand products from its sandtown property to meet the  tons per year capacity to satisfy the liberty oilfield supply agreement zig told me that select is currently ramping up to the  tons annual run rate and plan to surpass the  million ton production capacity mark in  furthermore to get to a  million ton production capacity select really only needs to buy some new pieces of equipment and upgrade some others which it can easily finance with the funds currently on hand selects ability to ship by railway and truck regarding the companys ability to regularly ship its sand by rail zig indicated that it currently uses  car units with each car able to hold approximately  tons of silica sand select sands is also evaluating its options to expand its rail capacity to satisfy clients needs and has access to other rail loading capability to build larger unit trains as required traditionally a unit train is composed of  railway cars currently the company has the capacity through a combination of using its  railway car units and its trucking options to ship its sand at an annualized rate in excess of  tons per year zig believes select has superior truck logistics capabilities arkansas itself is a truck transportation hub and select has found trucking resources readily available its shipping destinations have included georgia florida alabama tennessee louisiana oklahoma and texas liquidity after raising approximately  in a private placement in november  zig felt select sands is in good financial shape with no debt approximately  million in cash and approximately  mm in cash or equivalents assuming all of its options and warrants are exercised and sufficient liquidity to carry all currently announced projects through to completion without need for further funding while its liberty oilfield supply agreement should generate pretty steady cash flow for select it still has the ability to sell sand on the spot market as well spot market prices today vary but typically with some exceptions producers are reporting spot being in the low to mids per ton on an anecdotal basis and based upon what he has been hearing at recent oil  gas conferences the consensus is that pricing for selects type of sand is and will be increasing the rate of price increase could be the same or higher than that of wti and will certainly benefit if it does of course if the price of oil plummets that will likely negatively impact select sands bell farm acquisition announced january   on january   select announced that its wholly owned us subsidiary completed the purchase of an additional  acres of property bell farm located approximately  miles from its acre sandtown location bell farm is underlain by the st peter sandtown formation select believes the property is a source of northern white tier frac sand while zig was unable to provide many details he did confirm there was ongoing engineering work to determine quality of the sand and the quantity and indeed if any at all there was a prior engineering firm that was working on the bell farm project before select bought it and select is currently working with that engineering company with the intention of completing an ni  compliant report on the quality and quantity of the resource if applicable hicrush partners nysehclp acquisition of permian basin sand company on february   one of selects competitors hicrush partners lp announced it entered into a series of agreements to acquire permian basin sand company and related assets for  million exclusive of contingent earnout considerations the permian basin sand portion of the deal was for  million the permian basin sand company owns a acre sand reserve consisting of more than  million tons of  mesh sand and is located in the permian a logistical advantage no production facility is included but hicrush announced that it intends to have a processing plant producing  million tons per year for a cost of  million based upon the press release it appears that hicrush paid approximately  per ton of sand in the ground for permian basin sand company with no production facility comparing the two companies assets is difficult as they contain considerably different saliencies however while its not really a direct comparison you cant ignore the sale either on the one hand they are within the permian and will likely focus on that area select sands services a broad geographical area from the east coast to the southwestern us and has finer northern white tier sand selects future growth in discussing selects future prospects zig emphasized that the company has a great team and great assets the market for its products looks healthy it has a new longterm supply agreement with a robust customer and the company sees a lot of opportunities for growth i also asked zig about any additional ma opportunities he confirmed that select is always looking for opportunities and thinks the company has the team and capability to evaluate opportunities in greenfield ma and downstream logistics solutions the industry is going through a period of growth and consolidation and select is looking to better service the increase in demand for its type of silica sand and so is always considering all options finally i asked zig where he hoped select sands will be as a company in the next year or two he was quite optimistic current industry forecasts show that demand will outstrip supply he sees a lot of opportunities to increase selects contribution to that increasing demand select also hopes to uplist to the toronto stock exchange tsx main trading board which will provide even better access to capital markets and investors zig concluded stating that selects mission is to be in the top tier of sand suppliers in the next three to five years valuation select has not provided any guidance as to  revenues or expenses we do know however that it has recently transitioned from an exploration company into an operating company having landed a major supply agreement under which it began shipping product in february  providing a rough sum of the parts valuation i am taking into account the following  sandtown property contains  million tons of finer mesh finer quality sand with a acre production facility both dry and wet plant nearby with rail and trucking facilities taking into account the following factors i am roughly calculating the sandtown asset is worth in excess of  million based upon a potential run rate of sales of  million tons per year just from the liberty oilfield supply agreement i am assuming rates will be in the ton range which is just below current spot pricing based upon the foregoing assumptions the liberty oilfield contract alone could start generating  million gross revenues by next year on an annualized basis sources of other revenues could increase this figure as well it may be possible to add additional production capacity hicrushs recently announced acquisition february  under which it paid  per ton in the ground for a welllocated facility with brown sand and no permit or production facility and the june  pea which valued  of sandtown at a net present value npv of  million  million npv aftertax based upon average revenues of ton a preproduction cost of  million and operating costs in the range of ton processed  the bell farm the recently acquired  acre bell farm is in my view premature to be valued i prefer to wait until we can review the intended release of the ni  report before attributing any material value to it there is currently no guarantee that bell farm will have any material commercial value and it would be speculative to attribute value until select confirms its value and preferably until an ni is released to the public however i anticipate that a reasonable amount of due diligence was conducted before select sands closed the acquisition and assume the company must be reasonably confident this is a commercially viable asset assuming the ongoing engineering work is going well i expect the ni  for the bell farm is going to be finalized and be released by the end of q  perhaps early q and that it will contain a material amount of northern white tier frac sand however for whatever it is worth the oil and gas investments bulletin recently put out a short article on select sands in which the author estimated bell farm has  million tons of  mesh northern white sand   acresplus processing facility select sands bought the acre parcel and production facility assets at a remarkable bargain price but the asset should be valued at approximately  million given that the original pea assumed a  million capex to build the production facilities   million shares in comstock metals cslv comstock metals is a junior primarily gold exploration company headquartered in vancouver bc its shares trade on the tsx venture exchange under the symbol cslv the company is currently executing a meter drilling program at its preview exploration deposit in saskatchewan canada as more particularly disclosed in its march th press release found here for more information please see the company website the shares of the company are currently trading in the cdn range the shares are currently worth about cdn million based on the current stock trading price the valuation is speculative at this time  cash while select does have about  million in its treasury as well as a substantial number of inthemoney options and warrants i am not attributing any value to this cash or equivalents as the company does need some working capital based upon the foregoing i am valuing select sands at about  million approximately cdn million today on a fully diluted basis and assuming that bell farm has  value the current value of shares is approximately  per share or cdn potential upcoming catalysts the following are some of the potential upcoming catalysts for select sands the finalization and release of a ni  for bell farm im estimating that one will be finalized and released in q  or early q  there is no guarantee that a  will be released if it turns out not to be commercially viable but assuming it is and it contains a material amount of northern white tier sand or similar it could materially increase the value of select sands for example if bell farm provides an additional  million tons of commercially extractable northern white tier sand that could increase the value of select sands by an order of  million particularly as it is located close enough to sandtown to use the same production facility that alone could increase the value of selects shares by  cdn per share or more the current production facility being increased from  tons to  million ton capacity anticipated by me to be completed by late q or q the upgrade involves installation of equipment upgrades to the facility with funding from the companys existing cash additional and larger production facilities being built as well as improved and larger rail capacity increased sand prices on the spot market recognition of selects value as a producer which should provide a premium to todays share price value an increase in the value of the  million cslv shares in the event of a

situations longshort equity event driven investments biotechwwwgoldmanhinecomsummaryselect bell farm property adds  million additional tons of finer mesh silica sand to selects assets select now owns nearly  million tons of finer mesh northern white sandselects newly acquired  rail car unit rail loading facility provides additional value and efficiency to selects sand operations in arkansasthe value of select sands assets has materially increased because of these acquisitionsselect sands share price remains materially undervaluedselect sands corporation otcqxslsdf together with its wholly owned subsidiary select sands america corp is an industrial silica product company in early commercialization stages of its owned northern white tier silica sands project and bell farm property located in arkansas as well as other valuable assets my first article about select was published on sa on march   which provides background information regarding the company its management team and assets and explains why select sands is one of my top picks for  source select sands sandtown wet plant the market for selects northern white tier sand products in the oil and gas sector both in the permian and other areas located near arkansas is now in very high demand and the price for northern white tier silica sand is rapidly increasing after having been in a bear market from late  until the fall of  during the past number of months select has transitioned into a rapidly growing operating company with commercial sales of its tier sand now being sold into the oil  gas industry after announcing on january   its first  ton sale of its sand into the oil and gas industry on march th the company announced that it had entered into a substantial longterm supply agreement with liberty oilfield services liberty to supply  and  mesh sand products with volumes that will increase to more than  million tons per year by next year capital structure summary as of november  common shares  warrants  options  fully diluted  november  additional options grant  as per jan   press release unless otherwise stated all currency references in this article are in us dollars share price close april     week range  market cap us  million slsdf data by ycharts two new significant developments since writing my initial march th article select has announced two significant new developments  the acquisition of a  rail car loading facility and  the results of its ni  maiden inferred mineral resources report for its newly acquired bell farm property which indicates the addition of approximately  million tons inferred of med to high quality finer mesh silica sand lease to purchase acquisition of  rail car loading facility on april th select announced that it had entered into a lease to purchase agreement with newport rail loading facility llc seller of arkansas whereby select acquired a  rail car unit rail loading facility for us  payable over  years the firstyear payment of us  has been made to the seller and the balance will be paid out in equal amounts of us  every year until march  the loading facility located in diaz arkansas is connected to the union pacific railroad mainline and is  miles from the companys dry processing plant this rail loading facility is currently used by select sands and allows for loading and shipping of one  rail car unit per day approximately  tons of silica sand per day this rail car loading facility is being operated by select sands  days per week hence in addition to the trucking facilities can load and transport  tons of silica sand per week based upon a  day week and one  rail car unit day one further advantage of owning its own loading facility is that this should generate savings to select sands of approximately us  per ton being loaded excluding the cost of acquisition and maintenance costs bell farm property  ni  indicates inferred mineral resource of  million tons  of  mesh  of  mesh and  of  mesh  mesh on april th select announced the results of its national instrument  ni  maiden inferred resources calculation on its newly acquired  acre bell farm property the ni  concluded inferred mineral resources are  tons of mediumto fine grained white sandstone comprised of a grain size distribution of   mesh  of  mesh and  of  mesh  mesh this type of sand is generally described as northern white tier sand the bell farm property covers  acres has paved road access and available threephase power and located only about  miles northwest of the companys existing sandtown project as a result of this new ni  select now owns a total of approximately  million tons of sand most of which is finer mesh high quality northern white tier silica sand the conclusions in the bell farms ni  have substantially increased the value of select valuation while select has not yet provided any guidance as to its  revenues or expenses it has recently transitioned from an exploration and development company into an operating company having landed a major supply agreement with liberty under which it began shipping silica sand product in february  hopefully by the time select sands announces its q  results in mid to late may  investors should have a much better idea as to how  will be shaping up in calculating a rough sum of the parts valuation i am considering the following assets owned by select  sandtown property arkansas according to its independently prepared preliminary economic assessment pea report with details announced in june  the sandtown property contains approximately  million tons of finer mesh finer quality sand with a acre production facility both dry and wet plant nearby with rail and trucking facilities taking into account the following factors i am roughly calculating the sandtown frac sand asset is worth in excess of  million based on a potential run rate of sales of  million tons per year just from the liberty oilfield supply agreement i am assuming rates will be in the ton range which is just below current spot pricing based upon the foregoing assumptions the liberty oilfield contract alone could start generating  million gross revenues by next year on an annualized basis sources of other revenues could increase this figure as well it may be possible to add additional production capacity hicrush partners nysehclp february  acquisition of the permian basin sand company located in winkler county texas under which it paid  per ton for sand reserves for a welllocated facility with primarily texas brown sand with no permit or production facility see hicrushs february   press release for further details and the june  pea which valued  of sandtown at a net present value npv of  million  million npv aftertax based upon average revenues of ton a preproduction cost of  million and operating costs in the range of ton processed the bell farm   million tons of sand ni  the ni  for the recently acquired  acre bell farm indicates a  million ton inferred mostly finer mesh high quality white sand valuing it even at  per ton in the ground utilizing a  discount from the  per ton hicrush acquisition based upon its inferred ni  would still value the  million tons of sand at the bell farm property at us  million  acresplus processing facility while select sands bought the acre parcel and production facility assets at a remarkable bargain price the asset should be valued at approximately  million given that the june  pea assumed a  million capex to build the production facilities  million shares in comstock metals otcpkcmmmf comstock metals is a junior primarily gold exploration company headquartered in vancouver bc its shares trade on the tsx venture exchange under the symbol cslv and on the otc under symbol cmmmf the company owns mining deposits or mining rights in the yukon saskatchewan and ontario it is currently executing a meter drilling program at its preview exploration deposit in saskatchewan canada as more particularly disclosed in its march th press release found here for more information about comstock metals please see comstocks company website based upon the current trading price in the cdn share range the  million comstock metals shares are currently worth about cdn  million cash while select should have close to us  million in its treasury for the purposes of my valuation i am not attributing any value to this cash or equivalents as the company does need some working capital select has no debt other than the usual current trade payables based upon the foregoing on a sum of parts basis i am valuing select sands at about us  million approximately cdn  million based upon the foregoing assumption on a fully diluted basis the current value of selects shares is approximately us  per share otcqxslsdf or cdn  snsv which provides a substantial upside to selects current share price of us  or cdn  snsv potential upcoming catalysts the following are some of the potential upcoming catalysts for select sands the current production facility being increased from  tons to  million ton capacity anticipated to be completed by late q or q the upgrade involves installation of equipment upgrades to the facility with funding from the companys existing cash additional and larger production facilities being built as well as improved and larger rail capacity increased sand prices on the spot market on that note tudor pickering holt  co came out with a note on april  that  mesh sand is effectively sold out mesh and to some extent  are increasingly in demand q  pricing for  mesh sand is now materially above  per ton recognition of selects value as a producer which should provide a premium to todays share price value an increase in the value of the  million comstock metals shares in the event of a successful drilling program or other positive news the development of leadingedge downstream logistic solutions uplisting to the toronto stock exchange main board which i anticipate will likely occur by the end of q or q  additional ma to increase the assets of the company or alternatively being bought out itself risks select sands remains an early stage company and should be considered a speculative investment it has various risks including market risks oil and gas prices sand prices competition execution risks equipment failures litigation risks lack of trading liquidity and the various other risks which are set out in more detail in the company managements discussion and analysis mda filed quarterly and available on the sedarcom web site or the companys website disclosure i amwe are long
