down withstands occasional dropping is less expensive than other pumps…” shirleys story we want to hear from you tell us about your experience using our products and you can see it here on our website share your story frequently asked questions what needle sizes are available what length is recommended rms offers highflo subcutaneous safety needle sets™ in mm mm mm mm and mm needle lengths needle length should be selected according to how much subq tissue a patient has mm needles tend to work well with average sized patients while mm needles may be needed for very thin people and children similarly larger patients may require  or mm needles patients should work with their health care provider to determine their best length our needles are  gauge a measurement of needle thickness we make thinwalled g needles to minimize pain and still allow high flow rates with viscous drugs we struck the balance between speed and comfort for special applications we do also offer a g needle in mm mm and mm lengths call us to discuss g needles what are the best infusion sites if you are a patient your healthcare provider will help you determine the best sites for needle insertion the most common infusion site is the abdomen or stomach the upper buttocks or hips outside of iliac crest the outer side of the thighs and the back of the upper arms are also sometimes used these sites are better to use because they have a layer of fat just below the skin to accept drug more easily but not many nerves  which makes infusing those places more comfortable than other parts of the body whether and when to rotate infusion sites should be a subject for discussion with your healthcare provider you may achieve better results by periodically returning to sites that have worked well in the past however some find that repeated use of the same sites interferes with perfusion of medication how do i prime the needles should i use the slide clamp we recommend the patient follow the steps in our patient information guide but be sure to use the complete protocol supplied by the healthcare provider it may take some practice to master the technique some key points • keep needles dry • use the pump to prime to about two inches short of the needle butterflies • stop flow by turning the pump off and winding the knob back one full turn • the slide clamp is intended for emergencies only not priming what do i do if i see red or pink in the tubing lines while checking for blood return be sure to reference the complete protocol supplied by your healthcare provider or drug product manufacturer in our patient information guide we suggest that if you see blood return clamp the flow to that site patients can contact their home healthcare provider to determine if the dose can safely be run using the remaining sites if so continue if not remove all needles attach a new needle set and start over beginning with the priming step why is my infusion time longer than i expected there are a few likely causes  administration may be slow based on how well medication is absorbed through your tissue if this is your first time with subq it may take longer than expected because your body may need to create space in the subcutaneous layers in order to infuse in the time desired  if you are using the freedomedge™ confirm that you are using the correct size syringe ml syringes flow about  slower than ml syringes using the same precision flow rate tubing  it is best to avoid placing needles near areas of scar tissue or on top of muscle  slow flow can be a sign of blocked or small diameter needles  it is also possible you may need more sites longer needles or a faster flow rate tubing set what could cause drug to leak at the infusion sites first patients should contact their home health care provider and confirm that none of their supplies have changed additionally leaking drug could be caused by • excessive movement • a needle length that is too short • a site with too little subcutaneous tissue • too much volume in an individual site • oversaturation of the sites due to too fast a flow rate when in doubt or to address leaking and irritation select the next longest needle and a slower flow rate for more positive outcomes you can also try more sites or different sites if issues continue more sites and longer needles might also help allow faster infusions in the future how do i minimize pain or site reactions during an infusion many patients successfully infuse using highflo needle sets and the following tips • be sure to insert your subcutaneous needles dry igg or alcohol on the needles tends to irritate the skin • ensure that the needles you are using are long enough to reach your subq layers but not so long as to hit muscle • ask your provider about trying a slower rate tubing set especially for your first few infusions • think about site location if you have been having difficulty with rotating sites you may want to return to the sites that work best for you talk with your provider about your options what what about pain on insertion under the guidance of their clinical team patients report the highest success with carefully selected sites make sure to match the length of the needle to the depth of the site we recommend that you use highflo needles and that the tip of the needle does not come in contact with anything before insertion needle tip damage can contribute to patient pain and may be invisible to the naked eye a high quality needle which is kept dry during priming and inserted smoothly and quickly at ° also helps ensure the best results is longer tubing available do you have extension sets for patients who want a longer length between the pump and their sites we offer a ” extension set the extension set uses standard luers made to fit between the precision tubing and highflo needle set the extension has a negligible effect on flow performance and residual volume what does the fnumber on the tubing sets mean why is the flow rate faster than the tag when i bench test the pump the tag number on rms precision flow rate tubing™ set is an item number specific to the rms infusion pumps in some cases when infusing waterconsistency fluids at lower rates it may be equivalent to flow rate the numbering system originated from the design of our proprietary fluid testing system please do not try to correlate the tag numbers to normal bench testing results if you are using the freedom® pump and would like more information on the flow tag flow rate performance or bench test procedures see page

i have gone to  different rheumatologists and other doctors in search for relief from the constant pain in every single joint in my body i have found nothing that takes away all the pain but i have found a few medications that help during my search some of the therapies and infusions of strong medicines depleted my immune system i caught pneumonia was hospitalized and almost died twice i became disabled because the rangeofmotion in my joints became limited preventing me from moving very much i also could not be around too many people because i could easily catch illnesses this has been very difficult for me especially since my girls are young they are involved in girl scouts and play in their school orchestra i have missed many concerts and trips christmas parades etc i starting seeing a new doctor a couple of years ago once i became strong enough she started me on hizentra which is infused at home with little needles into the subcutaneous tissue i use  highflo needles and the freedom system these products are so userfriendly the nurse trained me so i can do the infusion according to our family schedule i even took it on vacation with us this year i feel much more ‘normal’ this medicine and the way it is administered allows me to accompany my daughters on many of their activities now” marguerite a have a story of your own to tell submit your story investor resources  rms

avenuejamaica ny  february   warning letter nyk  via united parcel servicedelivery signature requested mr andrew i sealfon ceorepromed systems inc dba rms medical products carpenter rdchester new york                     fei  dear mr sealfon during an inspection of your firm located in chester ny on june   through june   an investigator from the united states food and drug administration fda determined that your firm is a specification developer and manufacturer of infusion pumps ie freedom  syringe infusion pump and the freedom edge syringe infusion pump and intravascular administration sets  under section h of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § h these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body we received the responses from mr marc l somelofski regulatory affairs director dated july   and from dr fred ma chief medical officer dated february   to the observations noted on form fda  list of inspectional observations that was issued to you at the close of our inspection we address your responses below in relation to each of the noted violations these violations include but are not limited to the following adulterationmisbranding violationsour inspection revealed that the freedom  syringe and freedom edge infusion pumps are adulterated under section fb of the act  usc § fb because these devices are class iii devices under section f of the act  usc § cf and you do not have an approved application for premarket approval pma in effect as required by section a of the act  usc § ea or an approved application for an investigational device exemption ide under section g of the act  usc § jg  the freedom  syringe and freedom edge infusion pumps are also misbranded under section o of the act  usc § o because you did not notify the agency of your intent to introduce these devices into commercial distribution in that a notice or other information respecting the significant modifications to these devices and their new intended use was not provided to the fda as required by section k of the act  usc § k and  cfr ai and ii specifically you modified the freedom  syringe infusion pump cleared under k in a manner that could significantly affect safety and effectiveness when your firm a    changed the pressure specification range from  psi maximum to  psi maximumb    changed the flow rate specification range from  –  mlhr to    mlhr andc    developed and marketed a different version of the freedom  syringe infusion pump ie freedom edge infusion pump that uses a different syringe volume pumping mechanism and mode of operation in addition the freedom  syringe infusion pump was cleared under k with the following indications “the freedom  syringe infusion pump is intended for use in the home setting or hospital environment using any intravenous fluids recommended for use with such syringes as the becton dickinson  or sherwood medical  the freedom  syringe infusion pump is not indicated for the delivery of blood or blood products” however your firm is promoting the device for indications that would constitute a major change or modification to the device’s intended use for which your firm lacks clearance or approval specifically you are promoting this device for the infusion of prescribed liquid medicines including immunoglobulin g igg antibiotics desferal pain medications chemotherapeutics and cardiac medications these indications fall outside the cleared intended use because the freedom  syringe infusion pump is only cleared for iv infusion and not infusion of specific medications or blood or blood products like igg  indicating the device for a different route of administration or for specific medications or classes of medications raises new scientific review questions as such changes introduce new risks that are not normally associated with the cleared indication these changes in the design and intended use may affect the performance of the device and could significantly affect the safety and effectiveness of this device your firm has not submitted any correspondence to the fda regarding this violation to date  our inspection also revealed that the rms highflo subcutaneous safety needle set is adulterated under section fb of the act  usc § fb because this device is a class iii device under section f of the act  usc § cf and you do not have an approved application for premarket approval pma in effect pursuant to section a of the act  usc § ea or an approved application for an investigational device exemption ide under section g of the act  usc § jg this device is also misbranded under section o of the act  usc § o because you did not notify the agency of your intent to introduce this device into commercial distribution in that a notice or other information respecting the new intended use of the device was not provided to the fda as required by section k of the act  usc § k and  cfr aii specificallythe rms highflo subcutaneous safety needle sets were cleared under k with the following indication “rms highflo subcutaneous safety needle sets are intended for the delivery of medication to the subcutaneous tissue”  however your firm is marketing the device for subcutaneous immunoglobin scig infusion specifically your consumer brochure explains how to use the freedom edge syringe infusion systems including the rms highflo subcutaneous safety needle sets for scig infusion   during the review of k the intended use for scig infusion was specifically not covered by the cleared intended use because you were unable to supply the requested performance data  accordingly promoting the rms highflo subcutaneous safety needle sets for this indication falls outside the cleared intended use indicating the device for a different route of administration raises new questions of safety and effectiveness   your firm has not submitted any correspondence to the fda regarding this violation to date  for a device requiring premarket approval the notification required by section k of the act  usc § k is deemed satisfied when a pma is pending before the agency  cfr b  the kind of information you need to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for your device is described on the internet at httpwwwfdagovcdrhdevadvicehtml  the fda will evaluate the information you submit and decide whether your product may be legally marketed the fda requests that your firm immediately cease activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the aforementioned freedom  and freedom edge syringe infusion pumps and rms highflo subcutaneous safety needle sets such as the commercial distribution of the devices for the uses discussed above quality system violations this inspection revealed that your freedom  and freedom edge syringe infusion pumps and rms highflo subcutaneous safety needle set  are adulterated within the meaning of section h of the act  usc § h in that the methods used in or the facilities or controls used for its manufacture packing storage or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation found at title  code of federal regulations cfr part  these violations include but are not limited to the following     failure to complete design verification activities to confirm that the design output meets the design input requirements as required by  cfr § f specifically as it relates to design verification activities for the freedom edge syringe infusion pump and accessories flow rate tubing and needle sets a    your firm failed to conduct a flow profile study or similar study to test different flow rates using various types of precision flow tubing connected to your freedom edge syringe infusion pump to verify that device outputs flow rates would meet design input requirements listed in your pump’s instructions for use ifu when using a  ml or  ml bd luer lok syringe additionally you did not conduct a flow profile study or similar study to confirm that design inputs for flow rate requirements could be met with the use of various tubing to administer immunoglobulin drugs or other liquid medications drugs or substances with variable viscosity   b    your firm failed to conduct adequate design verification activities associated with ensuring average pressure design outputs were achieved to meet input requirements of  psi nominal to  psi peak review of your verification test plan allowed for only two infusion pumps to be tested for average pressure output your rationale for testing only two pumps rather than a greater number of pumps from multiple production lots is not conveyed and does not appear to be based on a sound statistical sampling plan the two pumps selected do not adequately verify the product’s ability to reproduce similar acceptable pressure outputs    c    your verification protocol outlined a need to establish a coefficient friction value for the  ml syringe used in conjunction with the freedom edge syringe infusion pump however a coefficient friction value was not established for the  ml syringe which is also used with this pump d    your design input checklist for the freedom edge syringe infusion pump showed essential input for the pump’s lifecycle was set for  cycles however this design input was later changed to  cycles as the understanding was that  cycles closely resembles two years of simulated use to support the product’s warranty verification test results did not fully support  cycles therefore you reclassified the two year input to  cycles the checklist currently still shows design input for two year life cycling as  cycles you either failed to conduct additional design verification testing for life cycling to verify this design input  cycles can be met or you failed to update design inputs and outputs to reflect  cycles and then failed to verify or validate to ensure  cycles is adequate to support device design e    your verification protocol for the freedom edge syringe infusion pump did not always identify an adequate test method for example the force gauge test was briefly described but lacked information concerning type of force gauge test equipment to be used amount of samples that would be tested the acceptance criteria for final force output and what correlation this measurement has on the pump’s average operating pressure  we reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate we acknowledge your firm is initiating capa  to improve the design control process and eliminate the root cause of the problem however a copy of this capa and its contents were not made available for review we acknowledge your response states you will take necessary steps to correct lacking verification activities noted in parts ae above however your response lacks inclusion of the necessary attachments references and reports necessary to support the validity of your proposed corrections also your response does not include any information regarding a systemic corrective action that includes a retrospective review of other products to ensure that design controls were documented and completed as required     failure to establish and maintain plans that describe or reference the design and development activities and define responsibility for implementation as required by  cfr § b specifically your firm does not have a plan that describes the design and development activities for the freedom edge syringe infusion pump in addition your design plan procedure  rev b is incomplete in that it does not describe all major design phases from market concept to design launch this design plan therefore fails to outline a road map for implementing and handling design and development activities in order to ensure all design steps are performed reviewed and documented prior to design release  we reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate while you indicate a design plan will be created to outline activities for the freedom edge syringe infusion pump no such plan has been provided for review to date you provided revised design procedures such as design plan procedure  rev c however we will need to assess successful training and implementation of this procedure during our next inspection  also your response does not include any information regarding a systemic corrective action to include a retrospective review of other products to ensure that design controls were documented and completed as required     failure to establish procedures to ensure that equipment is routinely calibrated inspected checked and maintained as required by  cfr a  specifically your procedure das calibration procedure  rev a containing calibration instructions for the cell load tester omega dyne pressure transducer b that was used to test freedom  syringe infusion pumps does not contain sufficient instructions to ensure routine calibration and maintenance adequate instructions for completing calibration adequate documentation of calibration results and provisions for remedial action to correct the fixture if not operating within precision or accuracy limits  also your firm does not have any preventative maintenance schedule or procedure or similar procedures to check andor replace sensors and any additional parts or equipment at your firm that may need maintenance   we reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate we acknowledge your response indicates you will be developing a calibration manual and master validation plan we also acknowledge you state you will develop a preventative maintenance procedure for your test fixture and have the load cell calibrated by a supplier of calibration services however these activities have not been completed to date andor documents to support these proposed actions have not been provided also your response does not include any information regarding a systemic corrective action to include a retrospective review of other products and their equipment to ensure all calibration and preventative maintenance activities are controlled as required     failure to establish and maintain procedures for rework to include retesting and revaluation of nonconforming product after rework to ensure that the product meets its current approved specifications as required by  cfr b specifically rework and revaluation activities including a determination of any adverse effect from the rework upon the product were not documented in the device history records dhrs for your freedom  syringe infusion pumps for example pump serial b was tested on  four times each time the pump was rejected on the fifth test the pump was released without evidence documented that the pump had been reworked andor how the pump had been reworked to meet specifications we reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate we acknowledge your procedure freedom pump performance test da  rev h allows for replacing of parts and retesting however the regulations require documentation of such actions in the dhr we acknowledge you state you will be revising form  to include a field to specify when the negator part on the pump is replaced and a field for when additional parts are replaced however objective evidence to observe and evaluate the stated correction is still in progress andor was not provided also your response does not include any information regarding a systemic corrective action to include a retrospective review of other products and their dhrs to ensure all rework and revaluation activities are being documented as required     failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action as required by  cfr a supplier corrective action report scar  dated  documented your supplier of pe bags b was supplying packaging with wrinkles in the seal the root cause was determined to be improper pressure for the rewind belt and the operator using excessive tension settings and the scar was closed based on employee retraining on  however review of your material disposition log for your highflo needle set  gauge  mm length needles b documented continued problems with seal quality to include wrinkles in the seal for additional seals provided by this supplier on  your scar did not adequately verify or validate the corrective action made by the supplier to ensure the action was effective and did not adversely affect the finished device the scar was closed without requiring or ensuring the root cause of the seal wrinkles was corrected and effective when continuing issues were identified with package seals from this supplier on  you did not reevaluate or reinvestigate the scar  we reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate you indicate you revised the corrective action process sop  revision g revised written capa procedures however have not been provided to date your response does not indicate any further corrective action activities will take place with respect to the package issues with your supplier      failure to establish and maintain procedures for acceptance activities as required by  cfr a specifically your tubing and needle set flow test procedure  rev l does not include test parameters or acceptance criteria for your f f and f precision flow tubing to indicate the acceptable flow rate for these products  we reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate you indicate that omission of the f and f tubing from the procedure is an oversight and does not affect product quality and you state that f has never been manufactured or distributed by the organization  you state you will be revising your tubing and needle set flow test procedure  to include acceptance criteria for f and f tubing however because you have not yet completed this revision we are not able to evaluate the stated correction mdr violations our inspection also revealed that the freedom  syringe infusion pump system with syringe set  tubing devices k infusion pump are misbranded under section t of the act  usc § t in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information regarding the devices that is required by or under section  of the act  usc § i and  cfr part   medical device reporting significant violations include but are not limited to failure to adequately develop maintain and implement written mdr procedures as required by  cfr   for example after reviewing your firm’s mdr procedure titled “adverse event  incident reporting”procedure no sop  rev a dated  the following issues were noted    sop  rev a does not establish internal systems that provide for timely and effective identification communication and evaluation of events that may be subject to mdr requirements for example a  the procedure omits definitions for the terms “become aware” “caused or contributed” from  cfr part  and definition for the term “reasonably suggests” from  cfr  c  the exclusion of the definitions for these terms from the procedure may lead your firm to make an incorrect reportability decision when evaluating a complaint that may meet the criteria for reporting under  cfr a    sop  rev a does not establish internal systems that provide for a standardized review process to determine when an event meets the criteria for reporting under this part  for example a       the procedure does not specify who makes the decision for reporting events to fda  b      there are no instructions for how your firm will evaluate information about an event to make mdr reportability determinations in a timely manner    sop  rev a does not establish internal systems that provide for timely transmission of complete medical device reports  specifically the following are not addressed a       although the procedure includes references to  day and  day reports it does not specify calendar days and work days respectively  b      how your firm will submit all information reasonably known to it for each      event    sop  rev a does not describe how it will address documentation and recordkeeping requirements including a       documentation of adverse event related information maintained as mdr event files b      information that was evaluated to determine if an event was reportable  c       documentation of the deliberations and decisionmaking processes used to determine if a devicerelated death serious injury or malfunction was or was not reportable d      systems that ensure access to information that facilitates timely followup and inspection by fda your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the fda without further notice these actions include but are not limited to seizure injunction and civil money penalties also federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of warning letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts additionally premarket approval applications for class iii devices to which the quality system regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected requests for certificates to foreign governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected please notify this office in writing
