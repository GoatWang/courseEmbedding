order of the commission under sections d and i and rule d thereunder the “order” to permit subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the application the “conditions” a regulated fund  and one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds  to enter into coinvestment transactions with each other “coinvestment transaction” means any transaction in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment sub participates together with one or more affiliated funds andor one or more other regulated funds in reliance on the order “potential coinvestment transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment sub could not participate together with one or more affiliated funds andor one or more other regulated funds without obtaining and relying on the order applicants  arcc is a closedend management investment company incorporated in maryland that has elected to be regulated as a business development company “bdc” under the act arccs board  currently consists of nine members five of whom are independent directors each of ares capital cp funding llc and ares capital jb funding llc is a whollyowned investment sub of arcc  acm a delaware limited liability company registered under the investment advisers act of  the “advisers act” serves as the investment adviser to arcc  ivy hill is a delaware limited partnership that is registered under the advisers act ivy hill is arccs indirect wholly owned portfolio company that manages the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the existing downstream ivy hill funds identified in appendix b to the application  each of the existing downstream ivy hill funds would be an investment company but for section c or c of the act  applicants state that in march  arcc received an exemptive order under sections c and d of the act which permits arcc to own and make additional investments in ivy hill the “d order” applicants state that the conditions to the d order provide that neither ivy hill including members of its investment committee with respect to covered information  received in their capacities as such nor any persons controlled by ivy hill “information providers” will directly or indirectly provide covered information to acm or any person affiliated with acm other than arcc and persons controlled by arcc and as necessary to be provided to acm and ares administration to provide advisory and administrative services to arcc and ivy hill such restrictions the “d restrictions” applicants believe that the d restrictions do not interfere with the applicants ability to comply with the conditions because the terms of the order would not modify the restrictions in the d order and ivy hill would comply in all respects with both the order and the d order applicants acknowledge that the requested order does not grant relief from sections a a a or a of the act  the existing affiliated funds are the investment funds identified in appendix a to the application applicants represent that each existing affiliated fund is a separate and distinct legal entity and each would be an investment company but for section c or c of the act  the existing advisers to affiliated funds are the investment advisers to the existing affiliated funds each of the start printed page existing advisers to affiliated funds is registered as an investment adviser under the advisers act  each of the applicants may be deemed to be directly or indirectly controlled by ares management lp “ares management” a publicly traded partnership and the parent company of the advisers ares management thus may be deemed to control the regulated funds and the affiliated funds applicants state that ares management is a holding company and does not currently offer investment advisory services to any person and is not expected to do so in the future applicants state that as a result ares management has not been included as an applicant  applicants state that a regulated fund may from time to time form one or more whollyowned investment subs such a subsidiary may be prohibited from investing in a coinvestment transaction with a regulated fund other than its parent or any affiliated fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent regulated entity for purposes of section a and rule d applicants request that each whollyowned investment sub be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of the regulated entity that owns it and that the whollyowned investment subs participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the order as though the parent regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated funds investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the parent regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the board of the parent regulated fund would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the parent regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board of the parent regulated fund will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub applicants representations a allocation process  applicants state that the advisers are presented with thousands of investment opportunities each year on behalf of their clients and must determine how to allocate those opportunities in a manner that over time is fair and equitable to all of their clients such investment opportunities may be potential coinvestment transactions  applicants represent that they have established processes for allocating initial investment opportunities opportunities for subsequent investments in an issuer and dispositions of securities holdings reasonably designed to treat all clients fairly and equitably further applicants represent that these processes will be extended and modified in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that the additional transactions permitted under the order will both i be fair and equitable to the regulated funds and the affiliated funds and ii comply with the conditions  specifically applicants state that the advisers are organized and managed such that the individual portfolio managers and investment teams responsible for identifying and evaluating investment opportunities and making investment decisions on behalf of clients are promptly notified of the opportunities if the requested order is granted the advisers will establish maintain and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that when such opportunities arise the advisers to the relevant regulated funds are promptly notified and receive the same information about the opportunity as any other advisers considering the opportunity for their clients in particular consistent with condition  if a potential coinvestment transaction falls within the thencurrent objectives and strategies  and any boardestablished criteria  of a regulated fund the policies and procedures will require that the relevant portfolio managers investment teams andor investment committees responsible for that regulated fund receive sufficient information to allow the regulated funds adviser to make its independent determination and recommendations under the conditions  the adviser to each applicable regulated fund will then make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the regulated fund in light of the regulated funds thencurrent circumstances if the adviser to a regulated fund deems the regulated funds participation in such potential coinvestment transaction to be appropriate then it will formulate a recommendation regarding the proposed order amount for the regulated fund  applicants state that for each regulated fund and affiliated fund whose adviser recommends participating in a potential coinvestment transaction the adviser will submit a proposed order amount to an allocation committee for the area in question eg credit private equity real estate on which senior management legal and compliance personnel start printed page participate applicants state that these allocation committees are structured with overlapping membership to ensure consistency of approach applicants state that at this stage each proposed order amount may be reviewed and adjusted in accordance with the advisers written allocation policies and procedures applicants state that prior to the external submission defined below the order amount will be submitted to the internal trading function which is comprised of a group of individual traders who collect and execute trades the order of a regulated fund or affiliated fund resulting from this process is referred to as its “internal order” the internal order of participating regulated funds will be submitted for approval by the required majority of any participating regulated funds in accordance with the conditions  if the aggregate internal orders for a potential coinvestment transaction do not exceed the size of the investment opportunity immediately prior to the submission of the orders to the underwriter broker dealer or issuer as applicable the “external submission” then each internal order will be fulfilled as placed if on the other hand the aggregate internal orders for a potential coinvestment transaction exceed the size of the investment opportunity immediately prior to the external submission then the allocation of the opportunity will be made pro rata on the basis of the size of the internal orders if subsequent to such external submission the size of the opportunity is increased or decreased or if the terms of such opportunity or the facts and circumstances applicable to the regulated funds or the affiliated funds consideration of the opportunity change the participants will be permitted to submit revised internal orders in accordance with written allocation policies and procedures that the advisers will establish implement and maintain b followon investments  applicants state that from time to time the regulated funds and affiliated funds may have opportunities to make followon investments  in an issuer in which a regulated fund and one or more other regulated funds andor affiliated funds previously have invested and continue to hold an investment  applicants propose that followon investments would be divided into two categories depending on whether the prior investment was a coinvestment transaction or a preboarding investment if the regulated funds and affiliated funds had previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer and continue to hold any securities acquired in a coinvestment transaction for that issuer then the terms and approval of the followon investment would be subject to the standard review followons described in condition  if the regulated funds and affiliated funds have not previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer but hold a preboarding investment then the terms and approval of the followon investment would be subject to the enhancedreview followons described in condition  all enhanced review followons require the approval of the required majority for a given issuer the participating regulated funds and affiliated funds would need to comply with the requirements of enhancedreview followons only for the first coinvestment transaction subsequent coinvestment transactions with respect to the issuer would be governed by the requirements of standard review followons  a regulated fund would be permitted to invest in standard review followons either with the approval of the required majority under condition c or without board approval under condition b if it is i a pro rata followon investment  or ii a nonnegotiated followon investment applicants believe that these pro rata and nonnegotiated followon investments do not present a significant opportunity for overreaching on the part of any adviser and thus do not warrant the time or the attention of the board pro rata followone investments and nonnegotiated followon investments remain subject to the boards periodic review in accordance with condition  start printed page  c dispositions  applicants propose that dispositions  would be divided into two categories if the regulated funds and affiliated funds holding investments in the issuer had previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer then the terms and approval of the disposition would be subject to the standard review dispositions described in condition  if the regulated funds and affiliated funds have not previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer but hold a preboarding investment then the terms and approval of the disposition would be subject to the enhanced review dispositions described in condition  subsequent dispositions with respect to the same issuer would be governed by condition  under the standard review dispositions  a regulated fund may participate in a standard review disposition either with the approval of the required majority under condition d or without board approval under condition c if i the disposition is a pro rata disposition  or ii the securities are tradable securities  and the disposition meets the other requirements of condition cii pro rata dispositions and dispositions of a tradable security remain subject to the boards periodic review in accordance with condition  d delayed settlement  applicants represent that under the terms and conditions of the application all regulated funds and affiliated funds participating in a coinvestment transaction will invest at the same time for the same price and with the same terms conditions class registration rights and any other rights so that none of them receives terms more favorable than any other however the settlement date for an affiliated fund in a coinvestment transaction may occur up to ten business days after the settlement date for the regulated fund and vice versa nevertheless in all cases i the date on which the commitment of the affiliated funds and regulated funds is made will be the same even where the settlement date is not and ii the earliest settlement date and the latest settlement date of any affiliated fund or regulated fund participating in the transaction will occur within ten business days of each other e holders  under condition  if an adviser its principals or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser or its principals and the affiliated funds collectively the “holders” own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting shares of a regulated fund the “shares” then the holders will vote such shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on matters specified in the condition applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the independent directors will act independently in evaluating coinvestment transactions because the ability of the adviser or its principals to influence the independent directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the independent directors can be removed will be limited significantly the independent directors shall evaluate and approve any independent party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis  section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person in any “joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profitsharing plan” as defined in the rule without prior approval by the commission by order upon application section d of the act and rule d under the act are applicable to regulated funds that are registered closedend investment companies  similarly with regard to bdcs section a of the act generally prohibits certain persons specified in section b from participating in joint transactions with the bdc or a company controlled by the bdc in contravention of rules as prescribed by the commission section i of the act provides that until the commission prescribes rules under section a the commissions rules under section d of the act applicable to registered closedend investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section a because the commission has not adopted any rules under section a rule d also applies to joint transactions with regulated funds that are bdcs  coinvestment transactions are prohibited by either or both of rule d and section a without a prior exemptive order of the commission to the extent that the affiliated funds and the regulated funds participating in such transactions fall within the category of persons described by rule d andor section b as applicable visàvis each participating regulated fund each of the participating regulated funds and affiliated funds may be deemed to be affiliated persons visàvis a regulated fund within the meaning of section a by reason of common control because i controlled affiliates of ares management manage each of the affiliated funds ii ares management controls acm which manages arcc and iii to the extent that arcc start printed page continues to control ivy hill the downstream ivy hill funds are and in the future will be deemed to be controlled by acm arcc or certain of arccs subsidiaries thus each of the affiliated funds could be deemed to be a person related to the downstream ivy hill funds in a manner described by section b and related to the other regulated funds in a manner described by rule d and therefore the prohibitions of rule d and section a would apply respectively to prohibit the affiliated funds from participating in coinvestment transactions with the regulated funds  in passing upon applications under rule d the commission considers whether the companys participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief in many circumstances the regulated funds would be limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities applicants state that as required by rule db the conditions ensure that the terms on which coinvestment transactions may be made will be consistent with the participation of the regulated funds being on a basis that it is neither different from nor less advantageous than other participants thus protecting the equity holders of any participant from being disadvantaged applicants further state that the conditions ensure that all coinvestment transactions are reasonable and fair to the regulated funds and their shareholders and do not involve overreaching by any person concerned including the advisers applicants state that the regulated funds participation in the coinvestment transactions in accordance with the conditions will be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be done in a manner that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants applicants conditions applicants agree that the order will be subject to the following conditions  identification and

coinvestment transaction to be appropriate for the regulated fund it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the regulated fund b if the aggregate amount recommended by the advisers

investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on the size of the internal orders as described in section iiiab of the application each adviser to a participating regulated fund will promptly notify and provide the eligible directors with information concerning the affiliated funds and regulated funds order sizes to assist the eligible directors with their review of the applicable regulated funds investments for compliance with these conditions c after making the determinations required in condition b above each adviser to a participating regulated fund will

applicants request that each whollyowned investment sub be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of the regulated entity that owns it and that the whollyowned investment subs participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the order as though the parent regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated funds investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the parent regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the board of the parent regulated fund would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the parent

behalf of their clients and must determine how to allocate those opportunities in a manner that over time is fair and equitable to all of their clients such investment opportunities may be potential coinvestment transactions     applicants represent that they have established processes for allocating initial investment opportunities opportunities for subsequent investments in an issuer and dispositions of securities holdings reasonably designed to treat all clients fairly and equitably further applicants represent that these processes will be extended and modified in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that the additional transactions permitted under the order will both i be fair and equitable to the regulated funds and the affiliated funds and ii comply with the conditions     specifically applicants state that the advisers are organized and managed such that the individual portfolio managers and investment teams responsible for identifying and evaluating investment opportunities and making investment decisions on behalf of clients are promptly notified of the opportunities if the requested order is granted the advisers will establish maintain and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that when such opportunities arise the advisers to the relevant regulated funds are promptly notified and receive the same information about the opportunity as any other advisers considering the opportunity for their clients in particular consistent with condition  if a potential coinvestment transaction falls within the thencurrent objectives and strategies  and any boardestablished criteria  of a regulated fund the policies and procedures will require that the relevant portfolio managers investment teams andor investment committees responsible for that regulated fund receive sufficient information to allow the regulated funds adviser to make its independent determination and recommendations under the conditions    footnote  objectives and strategies means i with respect to any regulated fund other than a bdc downstream fund its investment objectives and strategies as described in its most current registration statement

describe the characteristics of potential coinvestment transactions regarding which the adviser to the regulated fund should be notified under condition  the boardestablished criteria will be consistent with the regulated funds objectives and strategies if no boardestablished criteria are in effect then the regulated funds adviser will be notified of all potential coinvestment transactions that fall within the regulated funds thencurrent objectives and strategies boardestablished criteria will be objective and testable meaning that they will be based on observable information such as industrysector of the issuer minimum ebitda of the issuer asset class of the investment opportunity or required commitment size and not on characteristics that involve a discretionary assessment the adviser to the regulated fund may from time to time recommend criteria for the boards consideration but boardestablished criteria will only become effective if approved by a majority of the independent directors the independent directors of a regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of any boardestablished criteria though applicants anticipate that under normal circumstances the board would not modify these criteria more often than quarterly end footnote     the adviser to each applicable regulated fund will then make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the regulated fund in light of the regulated funds thencurrent circumstances if the adviser to a regulated fund deems the regulated funds participation in such potential coinvestment transaction to be appropriate then it will formulate a recommendation regarding the proposed order amount for the regulated fund     applicants state that for each regulated fund and affiliated fund whose adviser recommends participating in a potential coinvestment transaction the adviser will submit a proposed order amount to an allocation committee for the area in question eg credit private equity real estate on which senior management legal and compliance personnel participate applicants state that these allocation committees are structured with overlapping membership to ensure consistency of approach applicants state that at this stage each proposed order amount may be reviewed and adjusted in accordance with the advisers written allocation policies and procedures  applicants state that prior to the external submission defined below the order amount will be submitted to the internal trading function which is comprised of a group of individual traders who collect and execute trades the order of a regulated fund or affiliated fund resulting from this process is referred to as its internal order the internal order of participating regulated funds will be submitted for approval by the required majority of any participating regulated funds in accordance with the conditions     footnote  the reason for any such adjustment to a proposed order amount will be documented in writing and preserved in the records of the advisers end footnote    footnote  required majority means a required majority as defined in section o of the act in the case of a regulated fund that is a registered closedend fund the board members that make up the required majority will be determined as if the regulated fund were a bdc subject to section o in the case of a bdc downstream fund with a board of directors or the equivalent the members that make up the required majority will be determined as if the bdc downstream fund were a bdc subject to section o in the case of a bdc downstream fund with a transaction committee or advisory committee the committee members that make up the required majority will be determined as if the bdc downstream fund were a bdc subject to section o and as if the committee members were directors of the fund end footnote     if the aggregate internal orders for a potential coinvestment transaction do not exceed the size of the investment opportunity immediately prior to the submission of the orders to the underwriter broker dealer or issuer as applicable the external submission then each internal order will be fulfilled as placed if on the other hand the aggregate internal orders for a potential coinvestment transaction exceed the size of the investment opportunity immediately prior to the external submission then the allocation of the opportunity will be made pro rata on the basis of the size of the internal orders  if subsequent to such external submission the size of the opportunity is increased or decreased or if the terms of such opportunity or the facts and circumstances applicable to the regulated funds or the affiliated funds consideration of the opportunity change the participants will be permitted to submit revised internal orders in accordance with written allocation policies and procedures that the advisers will establish implement and maintain     footnote  the advisers will maintain records of all proposed order amounts internal orders and external submissions in conjunction with potential coinvestment transactions each applicable adviser will provide the eligible directors with information concerning the affiliated funds and regulated funds order sizes to assist the eligible directors with their review of the applicable regulated funds investments for compliance with the conditions eligible directors means with respect to a regulated fund and a potential coinvestment transaction the members of the regulated funds board eligible to vote on that potential coinvestment transaction under section o of the act end footnote    footnote  however if the size of the opportunity is decreased such that the aggregate of the original internal orders would exceed the amount of the remaining investment opportunity then upon submitting any revised order amount to the board of a regulated fund for approval the adviser to the regulated fund will also notify the board promptly of the amount that the regulated fund would receive if the remaining investment opportunity were allocated pro rata on the basis of the size of the original internal orders the board of the regulated fund will then either approve or disapprove of the investment opportunity in accordance with condition     or  as applicable end footnote b followon investments     applicants state that from time to time the regulated funds and affiliated funds may have opportunities to make followon investments  in an issuer in which a regulated fund and one or more other regulated funds andor affiliated funds previously have invested and continue to hold an investment    footnote  followon investment means an additional investment in the same issuer including but not limited to through the exercise of warrants conversion privileges or other rights to purchase securities of the issuer end footnote     applicants propose that followon investments would be divided into two categories depending on whether the prior investment was a coinvestment transaction or a preboarding investment  if the regulated funds and affiliated funds had previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer and continue to hold any securities acquired in a coinvestment transaction for that issuer then the terms and approval of the followon investment would be subject to the standard review followons described in condition  if the regulated funds and affiliated funds have not previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer but hold a preboarding investment then the terms and approval of the followon investment would be subject to the enhancedreview followons described in condition  all enhanced review followons require the approval of the required majority for a given issuer the participating regulated funds and affiliated funds would need to comply with the requirements of enhancedreview followons only for the first coinvestment transaction subsequent coinvestment transactions with respect to the issuer would be governed by the requirements of standard review followons    footnote  preboarding investments are investments in an issuer held by a regulated fund as well as one or more affiliated funds andor one or more other regulated funds that i were acquired prior to participating in any coinvestment transaction ii were acquired in transactions in which the only term negotiated by or on behalf of such funds was price and iii were acquired either a in reliance on one of the jt noaction letters defined below or b in transactions occurring at least  days apart and without coordination between the regulated fund and any affiliated fund or other regulated fund end footnote     a regulated fund would be permitted to invest in standard review followons either with the approval of the required majority under condition c or without board approval under condition b if it is i a pro rata followon investment  or ii a nonnegotiated followon investment  applicants believe that these pro rata and nonnegotiated followon investments do not present a significant opportunity for overreaching on the part of any adviser and thus do not warrant the time or the attention of the board pro rata followone investments and nonnegotiated followon investments remain subject to the boards periodic review in accordance with condition     footnote  a pro rata followon investment is a followon investment i in which the participation of each affiliated fund and each regulated fund is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer or security as appropriate immediately preceding the followon investment and ii in the case of a regulated fund a majority of the board has approved the regulated funds participation in the pro rata followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated fund the regulated funds board may refuse to approve or at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata followon investments in which case all subsequent followon investments will be submitted to the regulated funds eligible directors in accordance with condition c end footnote    footnote  a nonnegotiated followon investment is a followon investment in which a regulated fund participates together with one or more affiliated funds andor one or more other regulated funds i in which the only term negotiated by or on behalf of the funds is price and ii with respect to which if the transaction were considered on its own the funds would be entitled to rely on one of the jt noaction letters jt noaction letters means smc capital inc sec noaction letter pub avail sept   and massachusetts mutual life insurance company sec noaction letter pub avail june   end footnote c dispositions     applicants propose that dispositions  would be divided into two categories if the regulated funds and affiliated funds holding investments in the

condition  under the standard review dispositions     footnote  disposition means the sale exchange or other disposition of an interest in a security of an issuer end footnote    footnote  however with respect to an issuer if a regulated funds first coinvestment transaction is an enhanced review disposition and the regulated fund does not dispose of its entire position in the enhanced review disposition then before such regulated fund may complete its first standard review followon in such issuer the eligible directors must review the proposed followon investment not only on a standalone basis but also in relation to the total economic exposure in such issuer ie in combination with the portion of the preboarding investment not disposed of in the enhanced review disposition and the other terms of the investments this additional review would be required because such findings would not have been required in connection with the prior enhanced review disposition but they would have been required had the first coinvestment transaction been an enhanced review followon end footnote     a regulated fund may participate in a standard review disposition either with the approval of the required majority under condition d or without board approval under condition c if i the disposition is a pro rata disposition  or ii the securities are tradable securities  and the disposition meets

immediately preceding the disposition and ii in the case of a regulated fund a majority of the board has approved the regulated funds participation in pro rata dispositions as being in the best interests of the regulated fund the regulated funds board may refuse to approve or at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions in which case all subsequent

security holders and iii it trades with sufficient volume and liquidity findings as to which are documented by the advisers to any regulated funds holding investments in the issuer and retained for the life of the regulated fund to allow each regulated fund to dispose of its entire position remaining after the proposed disposition within a short period of time not exceeding  days at approximately the value as defined by section a of the act at which the regulated fund has valued the investment end footnote d delayed settlement     applicants represent that under the terms and conditions of the application all regulated funds and affiliated funds participating in a coinvestment transaction will invest at the same time for the same price and with the same terms conditions class registration rights and any other rights so that none of them receives terms more favorable than any other however the settlement date for an affiliated fund in a coinvestment transaction may occur up to ten business days after the settlement date for the regulated fund and vice versa  nevertheless in all cases i the date on which the commitment of the affiliated funds and regulated funds is made will be the same even where the settlement date is not and ii the earliest settlement date and the latest settlement date of any affiliated fund or regulated fund participating in the transaction will occur within ten business days of each other    footnote  applicants state that this may occur for two reasons first when the affiliated fund or regulated fund is not yet fully funded because when the affiliated fund or regulated fund desires to make an investment it must call capital from its investors to obtain the financing to make the investment and in these instances the notice requirement to call capital could be as much as ten business days second where for tax or regulatory reasons an affiliated fund or regulated fund does not purchase new issuances immediately upon issuance but only after a short seasoning period of up to ten business days end footnote e holders     under condition  if an adviser its principals or any person controlling controlled by or

the shares then the holders will vote such shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on matters specified in the condition applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the independent directors will act independently in evaluating coinvestment transactions because the ability of the adviser or its principals to influence the independent directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the independent directors can be removed will be limited significantly the independent directors shall evaluate and approve any independent party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant    applicants legal analysis     section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit

apply respectively to prohibit the affiliated funds from participating in coinvestment transactions with the regulated funds     in passing upon applications under rule d the commission considers
