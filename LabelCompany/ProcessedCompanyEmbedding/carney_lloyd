news and publications  breaking the tragedy of the horizon  climate change and financial stability  speech by mark carney   breaking the tragedy of the horizon  climate change and financial stability  speech by mark carney  september  page contentspeech given at lloyds of london speech  i’m grateful to lloyd’s for the invitation to speak tonight on the occasion of the first city dinner held in this magnificent eponymous “room” lloyd’s is the bedrock of the uk insurance industry   an industry whose direct contribution to the uk economy is impressive  highpaying jobs and £bn in annual gdp   its economic contribution goes much deeper   insurance supports households companies and investors safeguarding them from perils they could not otherwise shoulder   it matches longterm savings and investment financing the infrastructure essential to productivity   with its unique perspective and skill set insurance diversifies the financial system and reinforces its resilience   since  lloyd’s has in the great tradition of the city served both the uk and the world providing protection against the perils of the age helping enterprise and trade to thrive   from its origins in marine insurance the lloyd’s market has evolved constantly to meet the needs of a rapidly changing world   the first excess of loss reinsurance was created here   modern catastrophe cover was born with your decision to stand by policyholders after the san francisco earthquake    and lloyd’s pioneered aviation insurance    with eyes constantly on the horizon lloyd’s has remained at the forefront of global insurance   today you are insuring new classes of risk in new parts of the world – from cyber to climate from space to specie from curitiba to chengdu   and you are doing so in market conditions as challenging as any in the last  years   the need to manage emerging mega risks is as important as ever   alongside major technological demographic and political shifts our very world is changing shifts in our climate bring potentially profound implications for insurers financial stability and the economy   i will focus on those risks from climate change this evening   the tragedy of the horizon   there is a growing international consensus that climate change is unequivocal     many of the changes in our world since the s are without precedent not merely over decades but over millennia   research tells us with a high degree of confidence that   in the northern hemisphere the last  years have been the warmest since anglosaxon times indeed eight of the ten warmest years on record in the uk have occurred since   atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are at levels not seen in  years and the rate of sea level rise is quicker now than at any time over the last  millennia    evidence is mounting of man’s role in climate change human drivers are judged extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of global warming since the midth century   while natural fluctuations may mask it temporarily the underlying humaninduced warming trend of twotenths of a degree per decade has continued unabated since the s    while there is always room for scientific disagreement about climate change as there is with any scientific issue i have found that insurers are amongst the most determined advocates for tackling it sooner rather than later  and little wonder  while others have been debating the theory you have been dealing with the reality   since the s the number of registered weatherrelated loss events has tripled and   inflationadjusted insurance losses from these events have increased from an annual average of around bn in the s to around bn over the past decade    the challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come  the farsighted amongst you are anticipating broader global impacts on property migration and political stability as well as food and water security    so why isn’t more being done to address it   a classic problem in environmental economics is the tragedy of the commons  the solution to it lies in property rights and supply management   climate change is the tragedy of the horizon   we don’t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors – imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix   that means beyond   the business cycle  the political cycle and the horizon of technocratic authorities like central banks who are bound by their mandates   the horizon for monetary policy extends out to  years for financial stability it is a bit longer but typically only to the outer boundaries of the credit cycle – about a decade    in other words once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability it may already be too late   this paradox is deeper as lord stern and others have amply demonstrated as risks are a function of cumulative emissions earlier action will mean less costly adjustment    the desirability of restricting climate change to  degrees above preindustrial levels  leads to the notion of a carbon ‘budget’ an assessment of the amount of emissions the world can ‘afford’   such a budget  like the one produced by the ipcc    highlights the consequences of inaction today for the scale of reaction required tomorrow   these actions will be influenced by policy choices that are rightly the responsibility of elected governments advised by scientific experts  in ten weeks representatives of  countries will gather in paris at the cop summit to consider the world’s response to climate change it is governments who must choose whether and how to pursue that  degree world    and the role of finance  earlier this year g finance ministers asked the financial stability board to consider how the financial sector could take account of the risks climate change poses to our financial system   as chair of the fsb i hosted a meeting last week where the private and public sectors discussed the current and prospective financial stability risks from climate change and what might be done to mitigate them    i want to share some thoughts on the way forward after providing some context beginning with lessons from the insurance sector   climate change and financial stability   there are three broad channels through which climate change can affect financial stability    first physical risks the impacts today on insurance liabilities and the value of financial assets that arise from climate and weatherrelated events such as floods and storms that damage property or disrupt trade    second liability risks the impacts that could arise tomorrow if parties who have suffered loss or damage from the effects of climate change seek compensation from those they hold responsible  such claims could come decades in the future but have the potential to hit carbon extractors and emitters – and if they have liability cover their insurers – the hardest    finally transition risks the financial risks which could result from the process of adjustment towards a lowercarbon economy  changes in policy technology and physical risks could prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of assets as costs and opportunities become apparent   the speed at which such repricing occurs is uncertain and could be decisive for financial stability  there have already been a few high profile examples of jumptodistress pricing because of shifts in environmental policy or performance   risks to financial stability will be minimised if the transition begins early and follows a predictable path thereby helping the market anticipate the transition to a  degree world   to draw out these crucial points consider the bank of england’s current approach to the insurance sector   as regulator of the world’s third largest insurance industry the pra is responsible for protecting policyholders and ensuring the safety and soundness of insurers   our supervision is forwardlooking and judgementbased it is riskbased and proportionate – tailored to different business models around the sector – and considers both businessasusual and whether a firm can fail safely – recognising that “zero failure” is neither desirable nor realistic   our supervisors take a view of your business plans risk management governance and capital models  where the pra judges that it is necessary to intervene it does so sooner rather than later   while our mandate is to protect policyholders – many of whom are local – we are conscious that international competition needs robust and internationallyconsistent regulatory standards    solvency ii is a good example  it is a prudent but proportionate directive that embodies the core principles of our domestic standards and embeds them more consistently across europe while replacing a patchwork of local regimes    another example of how best practice is converging globally is the fsb agreement last week on hla for global systemic insurers as well as its support for the iasb completing its new insurance contracts standard  the uk insurance industry is wellprepared for such developments   forwardlooking regulators consider not just the here and now but emerging vulnerabilities and their impact on business models   that is why the pra has worked with regulated firms many of them represented here tonight to produce for the department for environment food and rural affairs a review – published today – into the impact of climate change on british insurers    the report concludes that insurers stand exposed to each of the three types of risk climate change poses to finance and while the sector is wellplaced to respond in the nearterm you should not assume your ability to manage risks today means the future is secure longer term risks could have severe impacts on you and your policyholders   the insurance response to climate change   it stands to reason that general insurers are the most directly exposed to such losses   potential increases in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events driven by climate change could mean longer and stronger heat waves the intensification of droughts and a greater number of severe storms   despite winter  being england’s wettest since the time of king george iii forecasts suggest we can expect at least a further  increase in rainfall during future winters    a prospect guaranteed to dampen the spirits and shoes of those who equate climate change with global warming   while the attribution of increases in claims to specific factors is complex the direct costs of climate change are already affecting insurers’ underwriting strategies and accounts   for example work done here at lloyd’s of london estimated that the cm rise in sealevel at the tip of manhattan since the s when all other factors are held constant increased insured losses from superstorm sandy by  in new york alone    beyond these direct costs there is an upward trend in losses that arise indirectly through secondorder events like the disruption of global supply chains   insurers are therefore amongst those with the greatest incentives to understand and tackle climate change in the short term your motives are sharpened by commercial concern as capitalists and by moral considerations as global citizens  and your response is at the cutting edge of the understanding and management of risks arising from climate change   lloyd’s underwriters were the first to use storm records to mesh natural science with finance in order to analyse changing weather patterns  events like hurricanes andrew katrina and ike have helped advance catastrophe risk modelling and provisioning  today lloyd’s underwriters are required to consider climate change explicitly in their business plans and underwriting models    your genius has been to recognise that past is not prologue and that the catastrophic norms of the future can be seen in the tail risks of today    for example by holding capital at a one in  year risk appetite uk insurers withstood the events of  one of the worst years on record for insurance losses your models were validated claims were paid and solvency was maintained   the combination of your forecasting models a forwardlooking capital regime and business models built around shortterm policies means general insurers are wellplaced to manage physical risks in the near term   but further ahead increasing levels of physical risk due to climate change could present significant challenges to general insurance business models   improvements in risk modelling must be unrelenting as loss frequency and severity shifts with   insurance extending into new markets not covered by existing models previously unanticipated risks coming to the fore and increasingly volatile weather trends and hydrological cycles making the future everharder to predict    for example the extent to which european windstorms occur in clusters  could increase the frequency of catastrophes and reduce diversification benefits    indeed there are some estimates that currently modelled losses could be undervalued by as much as  if recent weather trends were to prove representative of the new normal    in addition climate change could prompt increased morbidity and mortality from disease or pandemics   such developments have the potential to shift the balance between premiums and claims significantly and render currently lucrative business nonviable   absent actions to mitigate climate change policyholders will also feel the impact as pricing adjusts and cover is withdrawn    insurers’ rational responses to physical risks can have very real consequences and pose acute public policy problems    in some extreme cases householders in the caribbean have found storm patterns render them unable to get private cover prompting mortgage lending to dry up values to collapse and neighbourhoods to become abandoned  thankfully these cases are rare but  the recognition of the potential impact of such risks has prompted a publiclybacked scheme in the uk – flood re – to ensure access to affordable flood insurance for half a million homes now considered to be at the highest risk of devastating flooding   this example underlines a wider point while the insurance industry is well placed to adapt to a changing climate in the shortterm their response could pose wider issues for society including whether to nationalise risk   the passage of time may also reveal risks that even the most advanced models are not able to predict such as third party liability risks   participants in the lloyd’s market know all too well that what appear to be low probability risks can evolve into large and unforeseen costs over a longer timescale   claims on thirdparty liability insurance – in classes like public liability directors’ and officers’ and professional indemnity  could be brought if those who have suffered losses show that insured parties have failed to mitigate risks to the climate failed to account for the damage they cause to the environment or failed to comply with regulations   asbestos alone is expected to cost insurers bn on a net ultimate claims basis in the united states – equivalent to almost three superstorm sandysized loss events     it would be premature to draw too close an analogy with climate risks and it is true that court cases have so far largely been unsuccessful   cases like arch coal and peabody energy – where it is alleged that the directors of corporate pension schemes failed in their fiduciary duties by not considering financial risks driven at least in part by climate change  – illustrate the potential for longtail risks to be significant uncertain and nonlinear   and ‘loss and damage’ from climate change – and what to do about it – is now formally on the agenda of the united nations framework convention on climate change with some talking openly about the case for compensation    these risks will only increase as the science and evidence of climate change hardens   physical risks from climate change will also become increasingly relevant to the asset side of insurer’s balance sheets    while the ability to reprice or withdraw cover mitigates some risk to an insurer as climate change progresses insurers need to be wary of cognitive dissonance within their organisations whereby prudent decisions by underwriters lead to falls in the value of properties held by the firm’s asset managers  this highlights the transition risk from climate change   transition risks   the uk insurance sector manages almost £tn in assets to match liabilities that often span decades while a given physical manifestation of climate change – a flood or storm – may not directly affect a corporate bond’s value policy action to promote the transition towards a lowcarbon economy could spark a fundamental reassessment   take for example the ipcc’s estimate of a carbon budget that would likely limit global temperature rises to  degrees above preindustrial levels   that budget amounts to between th and rd world’s proven reserves of oil gas and coal      if that estimate is even approximately correct it would render the vast majority of reserves “stranded” – oil gas and coal that will be literally unburnable without expensive carbon capture technology which itself alters fossil fuel economics      the exposure of uk investors including insurance companies to these shifts is potentially huge    of ftse  companies are in natural resource and extraction sectors and a further  by value are in power utilities chemicals construction and industrial goods sectors  globally these two tiers of companies between them account for around one third of equity and fixed income assets   on the other hand financing the decarbonisation of our economy is a major opportunity for insurers as longterm investors  it implies a sweeping reallocation of resources and a technological revolution with investment in longterm infrastructure assets at roughly quadruple the present rate    for this to happen “green” finance cannot conceivably remain a niche interest over the medium term   there are a number of factors which could influence the speed of transition to a low carbon economy including public policy technology investor preferences and physical events   from a regulator’s perspective the point is not that a reassessment of values is inherently unwelcome it is not  capital should be allocated to reflect fundamentals including externalities   but a wholesale reassessment of prospects especially if it were to occur suddenly could potentially destabilise markets spark a procyclical crystallisation of losses and a persistent tightening of financial conditions   in other words an abrupt resolution of the tragedy of horizons is in itself a financial stability risk   the more we invest with foresight the less we will regret in hindsight   and there are ways to make that more likely   financial policy implications   financial policymakers will not drive the transition to a lowcarbon economy it is not for a central banker to advocate for one policy response over another  that is for governments to decide   but the risks that i have outlined mean financial policymakers do however have a clear interest in ensuring the financial system is resilient to any transition hastened by those decisions and that it can finance the transition efficiently   some have suggested we ought to accelerate the financing of a low carbon economy by adjusting the capital regime for banks and insurers that is flawed history shows the danger of attempting to use such changes in prudential rules – designed to protect financial stability – for other ends   more properly our role can be in developing the frameworks that help the market itself to adjust efficiently   any efficient market reaction to climate change risks as well as the technologies and policies to address them must be founded on transparency of information    a ‘market’ in the transition to a  degree world can be built  it has the potential to pull forward adjustment – but only if information is available and crucially if the policy responses of governments and the technological breakthroughs of the private sector are credible   that is why following our discussions at the fsb last week we are considering recommending to the g summit that more be done to develop consistent comparable reliable and clear disclosure around the carbon intensity of different assets   better information to allow investors to take a view   an old adage is that which is measured can be managed   information about the carbon intensity of investments allows investors to assess risks to companies’ business models and to express their views in the market    a wellknown dictum of macroeconomics is say’s law that supply creates demand   this means that the act of producing new products creates income and profits that ultimately finance the demand for them   by analogy a framework for firms to publish information about their climate change footprint and how they manage their risks and prepare or not for a  degree world could encourage a virtuous circle of analyst demand and greater use by investors in their decision making  it would also improve policymaker understanding of the sources of co and corporate preparedness   a carbon budget – like the one produced by the ipcc – is hugely valuable but can only really be brought to life by disclosure giving policymakers the context they need to make choices and firms and investors the ability to anticipate and respond to those choices   given the uncertainties around climate not everyone will agree  some might dispute the ipcc’s calculations others might despair that there will never be financial consequences of burning fossil fuels  still others could take a view that the stakes make political action inevitable    the right information allows sceptics and evangelists alike to back their convictions with their capital      it will reveal how the valuations of companies that produce and use fossil fuels might change over time   it will expose the likely future cost of doing business paying for emissions changing processes to avoid those charges and tighter regulation   it will help smooth price adjustments as opinions change rather than concentrating them at a single climate “minsky moment”   crucially it would also allow feedback between the market and policymaking making climate policy a bit more like monetary policy    policymakers could learn from markets’ reactions and refine their stance with better information allowing more informed reactions and supporting better policy decisions including on targets and instruments   a climate disclosure task force   that better information – about the costs opportunities and risks created by climate change – can promote timely responses is not a new idea   much the opposite there are already nearly  initiatives to provide such information   existing schemes vary in their status from laws to voluntary guidance scope from greenhouse gas emissions to broader environmental risks and ambition from simple disclosure to full explanations of mitigation and divestment strategies     in aggregate over  of ftse  firms and  of fortune global  firms participate in these various initiatives for instance the carbon disclosure project makes available disclosure from  companies to investment managers responsible for over  trillion of assets   the existing surfeit of existing schemes and fragmented disclosures means a risk of getting “lost in the right direction”   in any field financial scientific or other the most effective disclosures are   consistent  in scope and objective across the relevant industries and sectors comparable  to allow investors to assess peers and aggregate risks reliable  to ensure users can trust data clear  presented in a way that makes complex information understandable and efficient  minimising costs and burdens while maximising benefits   meeting these standards requires coordination something the g and fsb are uniquely placed to provide   the logical starting point is a coordinated assessment of what constitutes effective disclosure by those who understand what is valuable and feasible   one idea is to establish an industryled group a climate disclosure task force to design and deliver a voluntary standard for disclosure by those companies that produce or emit carbon    companies would disclose not only what they are emitting today but how they plan their transition to the netzero world of the future  the g – whose member states account for around  of global emissions   – has a unique ability to make this possible   this kind of proposal takes its lead from the fsb’s successful catalysing of improved disclosure by the world’s largest banks following the financial crisis via the enhanced disclosure task force   the edtf’s recommendations published in october  were the product of collaboration between banks analysts and investors  this has given the providers of capital the disclosures they need – specifically how banks manage risks and make profits – in a format that the banks can readily supply    that shows that private industry can improve disclosure and build market discipline without the need for detailed or costly regulatory interventions   like the edtf a cdtf could be comprised of private providers of capital major issuers accounting firms and rating agencies    complementing static disclosures   static disclosure is a necessary first step  there are two ways its impact could be amplified   first governments potentially sparked by cop could complement disclosure by giving guidance on possible carbon price paths    such a carbon price corridor involves an indicative minimum and maximum price for carbon calibrated to reflect both price and nonprice policy actions and increasing over time until the price converges towards the level required to offset fully the externality     even if the initial indicative price is set far below the “true” cost of carbon the price signal itself holds great power  it would link climate exposures to a monetary value and provide a perspective on the potential impacts of future policy changes on asset values and business models   second stress testing could be used to profile the size of the skews from climate change to the returns of various businesses    this is another area where insurers are at the cutting edge   your capital requirements are based on evaluating the impact of severe but plausible scenarios you peer into the future building your defences against a world where extreme events become the norm    this stresstesting technology is wellsuited to analysing tail risks likely to grow fatter with time casting light on the future implications of environmental exposures embedded in a wide range of firms and investments   stress testing built off better disclosure and a price corridor could act as a time machine shining a light not just on today’s risks but on those that may otherwise lurk in the darkness for years to come   conclusion   our societies face a series of profound environmental and social challenges   the combination of the weight of scientific evidence and the dynamics of the financial system suggest that in the fullness of time climate change will threaten financial resilience and longerterm prosperity   while there is still time to act the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking    others will need to learn from lloyd’s example in combining data technology and expert judgment to measure and manage risks   the december meetings in paris will work towards plans to curb carbon emissions and encourage the funding of new technologies    we will need the market to work alongside in order to maximise their impact   with better information as a foundation we can build a virtuous circle of better understanding of tomorrow’s risks better pricing for investors better decisions by policymakers and a smoother transition to a lowercarbon economy   by managing what gets measured we can break the tragedy of the horizon    the first aviation policy was written in  followed in  by the founding of the british aviation insurance association that venture closed in
