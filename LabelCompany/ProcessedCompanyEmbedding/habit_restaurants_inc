search search better buy shake shack inc vs habit restaurants inc its east coast versus west coast in the battle of the burgers one tiny variable is all that really differentiates them brian stoffel tmfcheesehead jul   at pm its never been easier to get a great burger at your corner chain while shake shack nyseshak and habit restaurants nasdaqhabt  parent of habit burger grill  are still both very young companies with small footprints they both aspire to hold solid niches across the country in the coming decade they want to be the ones serving you your burgers but the restaurant business can be brutal theres nothing one outfit can offer that another cant immediately copy thats what makes these two chains so unique  they experienced enough success to become publicly traded entities and start rapid expansion image source getty images so which stock is the better buy today thats impossible to answer with  certainty but we can get a better idea for what we get when we buy shares by evaluating these companies on three different continuums lets see how they stack up sustainable competitive advantages theres nothing more important to restaurants than scale and brand power  as i mentioned above theres nothing to prevent one chain from outandout copying exactly what another chain does by having a large scale management can squeeze out more profitability it can also create more brand awareness which is the other key differentiator when it comes to restaurant chains people like to know what theyre getting before deciding on a restaurant and the strength of a brand plays into that decision shake shack made its name in new york city while habit spent most of its life as a family run outfit in california the former currently has  shacks open while the latter has  locations up and running that means they are more or less on the same scale right now when it comes to brand value it is difficult to differentiate between the two because they are both so small most major brand evaluators overlook them so ill move to a critical restaurant industry metric to see which has more momentum going its way right now same store sales heres how they compare samestore sales growthinfogram theres simply not enough difference between these two for me to definitively say that one brand is stronger than another winner  tie financial fortitude while investors might like to see management continually pour cash back into growth opportunities at these fledgling companies theres something to be said for keeping a pile of cash on hand thats because every company at one point or another is going to face difficult economic times in the case of shake shack and habit without that cash the stores could be in serious jeopardy of going bankrupt in a downturn keeping that mind and remembering that shake shack is valued at just over twice the size of habit burger heres where they stand in terms of financial fortitude company cash debt net income free cash flow shake shack  million   million  million habit  million   million  million data source sec filings yahoo finance net income and free cash flow presented on trailingtwelvemonth basis once again these two are virtually identical while shake shack is generating more income habit was the one actually putting more cash in its pocket free cash flow over the past twelve months and both are in good shape with no longterm debt to speak of winner  tie valuation finally we have the murky science of valuation while theres no single metric that can tell you if a stock is cheap or expensive there are a number of data points we can consult here are five that i like to use company pe pfcf ps peg ratio shake shack     habit     data source yahoo finance etrade pe calculated using nongaap earnings when possible both companies are very expensive on earnings freecashflow and growth peg ratio bases but because the earnings and free cash flow at both are held down by their aspirations to build new locations these metrics arent the most reliable the one that is however is pricetosales and on that metric habit appears to be trading for a  discount to shake shack thats enough of a differentiator for me to declare a winner winner  habit my winner is so there you have it these two burger shops are very similar in a number of ways size financial fortitude and moats even when it comes to valuation they are neckandneck but with a significantly lower pricetosales ratio im giving the edge here to habit burger brian stoffel has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool is short shake shack the
