note   summary of significant accounting policies security valuation  taxexempt municipal securities are stated at the value determined by the evaluator the evaluator may determine the value of the bonds  on the basis of current bid prices of the bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by each of the trusts  on the basis of bid prices for comparable bonds  by determining the value of the bonds by appraisal or  by any combination of the above security cost  the original cost to each of the trusts insured municipals income trust series  and insured municipals income trust laddered series  was based on the determination by jj kenny co of the offering prices of the bonds on the date of deposit july   since the valuation is based upon the bid prices such trusts insured municipals income trust series  and insured municipals income trust laddered series  recognized downward adjustments of  and  respectively on the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices these downward adjustments were included in the aggregate amount of unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for each trust for the period ended june   unit valuation  the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit in each trust based upon  the cash on hand in such trust or monies in the process of being collected  the bonds in such trust based on the value determined by the evaluator and  interest accrued thereon less accrued expenses of the trust if any federal income taxes  the trust is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes each unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of such trust and accordingly no provision has been made for federal income taxes other  the financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are reported on an identified cost basis note   portfolio ratings  the source of all ratings exclusive of those designated nr or  is standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies ratings marked  are by moodys investors service inc as these

information supplement redemption feature  there is shown under this heading the year in which each issue of bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for that year each issue of bonds continues to be callable at declining prices thereafter but not below par value except for original issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus if applicable some premium the amount of which will decline in subsequent years sf indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds pr indicates a bond has been prerefunded redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par to the extent that the bonds were deposited in the trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units conversely to the extent that the bonds were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price this will represent an increase in capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed bonds and there will be distributed to unitholders the principal amount in excess of  per unit semiannually and any premium received on such redemption however should the amount available for distribution in the principal account exceed  per unit the trustee will make a special distribution from the principal account on the next succeeding monthly distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record date the estimated current return in this event may be affected by such redemptions for the federal tax effect on unitholders of such redemptions and resultant distributions see federal tax status in part ii insurance  insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in the insured municipals income trust series  and insured municipals income trust laddered series  trusts has been obtained by the trusts or by one of the preinsured bond insurers as indicated in the bond name such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units for bonds covered under the trusts insurance policy the insurance is effective only while bonds thus insured are held in the trust and the insurance premium which is a trust obligation is paid on a monthly basis the premium for insurance which has been obtained from various insurance companies by the issuer of the bond involved is payable by the issuer note   portfolio continued an accounting and auditing guide issued by the american institute of certified public accountants states that for financial reporting purposes insurance coverage of the type acquired by the trust does not have any measurable value in the absence of default of the underlying bonds or indication of the probability of such default in the opinion of the evaluator there is no indication of a probable default of bonds in the portfolio as of the date of these financial statements unrealized appreciation and

other marketability  although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for units and to continuously offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid price of the bonds in the portfolio of each trust plus interest accrued to the date of settlement if the supply of units exceeds demand or for other business reasons the sponsor may discontinue purchases of units at such prices in the event that a market is not maintained for the units a unitholder desiring to dispose of his units may be able to do so only by tendering such units to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price cost to investors  the cost to original investors was based on the evaluators determination of the aggregate offering price of the bonds per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus a sales charge of  of the public offering price which is equivalent to  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds for the imit trust and  of the public offering price which is equivalent to  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds for the remaining trust the secondary market cost to investors is based on the evaluators determination of the aggregate bid price of the bonds per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus a sales charge based upon the years to average maturity of the bonds in the portfolio the sales charge ranges from  of the public offering price  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds for a trust with a portfolio with less than two years to average maturity to  of the public offering price  of the aggregate

desire to participate in a portfolio of taxexempt fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in each insured trust has been obtained from a municipal bond insurance company for information relating to insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in the insured trusts in addition these bonds are often not available in small amounts in selecting bonds for the trusts the sponsor considered the following factors among others a with respect to insured trusts the bonds must be insured with a standard  poors rating of aaa or a moodys investors service inc moodys rating of aaa with respect to all quality trusts the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of at least a a moodys rating of at least a or if not rated credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor and with respect to all other trusts either the standard  poors rating of the bonds was not less than bbb or the moodys rating of the bonds was not less than baa including provisional or conditional ratings respectively or if not rated the bonds had credit characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interestbearing taxexempt bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in particular the ratings of the bonds in an investment grade municipal trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors the bonds your trust invests in municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds we seek to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment these bonds are described in greater detail in the information supplement see additional information general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor own this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early the first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is listed in prospectus part i along with the price the issuer would have to pay bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described under the bonds reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income andor principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust for example future legislation could reduce tax rates impose a flat tax exempt all investment income from tax or change the tax treatment of the bonds or of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current returns and the estimated longterm returns are set forth in the prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trust and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life eltr life of a trusts portfolio enlargedownload table eltr life sales charge eltr life sales charge eltr life sales charge                                                to   the eltr life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a trusts portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating estimated longterm return see estimated current and longterm returns the sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your brokerdealer of your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a reduced sales charge fee accounts a portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in this paragraph purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the sponsor please refer to the section called fee accounts for additional information on these purchases units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the public offering price less the concession the sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers for purchases by investors who purchase units through registered investment advisers certified financial planners and registered brokerdealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services financial planning investment advisory or asset management services or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge is imposed fee accounts the sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of units described in this paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a trust employees employees officers and directors including their spouses and children under  living in the same household and trustees custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons of van kampen funds inc and its affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may purchase units at the public offering price less the applicable dealer concession all employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm only employees officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts offering price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading orders received by the trustee or sponsor for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day when the new york stock exchange is closed will be held until the next determination of price the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately  more than the bid price the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the fund b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an insured trust if any the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of default the defaulted bonds the value of any insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of a portfolio insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy including commitments to issue permanent insurance no value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by an insured trust if any as of the date of this prospectus a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest accrued interest to carry accrued interest to carry is added to the public offering price for insured municipals income trust st insured multiseries and prior series and insured municipals income trust and investors quality taxexempt trust multiseries  and prior series accrued interest to carry consists of two elements the first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on securities in each trust is actually paid either monthly quarterly if applicable or semiannually to such trust however interest on the securities in each trust is accounted for daily on an accrual basis because of this each trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee because of coupons that are not yet due for this reason the public offering price will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest to the date of settlement the second element of accrued interest to carry arises because of the structure of the interest account the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders of a trust until it receives interest payments on the securities in such trust the trustee is obligated to provide its own funds at times in order to advance interest distributions the trustee will recover these advancements when such interest is received interest account balances are established so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection with such interest distributions the interest account balances are also structured so that there will generally be positive cash balances and since the funds held by the trustee may be used by it to earn interest thereon it benefits thereby if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units or if the bonds in a trust are sold or otherwise removed or if a trust is liquidated he will receive at that time his proportionate share of the accrued interest to carry computed to the settlement date in the case of sale or liquidation and to the date of tender in the case of redemption purchased and accrued interest added to the public offering price for insured municipals income trust ndrd insured multiseries and insured municipals income trust and investors quality taxexempt trust multiseries  is purchased interest and accrued interest included in the public offering price for insured municipals income trust th insured multiseries and subsequent series and insured municipals income trust and investors quality taxexempt trust multiseries  and subsequent series is accrued interest only references to accrued interest in this prospectus include both purchased interest and accrued interest as described in this section purchased interest  purchased interest is a portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the securities from the later of the last payment date on the securities or the date of issuance thereof through the first settlement date and is included in the calculation of the public offering price purchased interest will be distributed to unitholders as units are redeemed or securities mature or are called see summary of essential financial information in this prospectus part i for the amount of purchased interest per unit for each trust purchased interest is an element of the price unitholders will receive in connection with the sale or redemption of units prior to the termination of a trust accrued interest  accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although a trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units unitholders will receive on the next distribution date of a trust the amount if any of accrued interest paid on their units as indicated in purchased interest accrued interest as of the first settlement date includes purchased interest in an effort to reduce the amount of purchased interest which would otherwise have to be paid by unitholders the trustee may advance a portion of such accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement other than the purchased interest already included therein less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the purchased interest and accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds including purchased interest held in the interest account for distributions to unitholders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unitholders the trustee benefits thereby accrued interest accrued interest is added to the public offering price for all trusts not listed above accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although each trust accrues interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest as described in this paragraph to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units for all trusts not mentioned above unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the sponsor intends to qualify units for sale in a number of states brokerdealers or others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the distribution of units equal to  of the sales charge applicable to the transaction provided that the units are acquired from the sponsor certain commercial banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge paid by these customers equal to the agency commission referred to above is retained by or remitted to the banks any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or agent the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units and to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge sponsor compensation the sponsor will receive a gross sales commission equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved see public offeringgeneral in addition the sponsor realized a profit or loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a trust the sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in the trusts were acquired the sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of units excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed if any will be retained by the sponsor the sponsor will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which units are purchased and the price at which units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased units at a price above or below the purchase price brokerdealers of the trusts banks andor others are eligible to participate in a program in which such firms receive from the sponsor a nominal award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units of unit investment trusts created by the sponsor during a specified time period in addition at various times the sponsor may implement other programs under which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the sponsor or participate in sales programs sponsored by the sponsor an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs also the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the trusts such payments are made by the sponsor out of its own

every eighteen months the sponsor holds a business seminar which is open to certain underwriters that sell units of trusts it sponsors the sponsor pays substantially all costs associated with the

prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash on hand less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the trust and less any accrued trust expenses if the supply of units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it the sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of units or discontinue purchases of units at these prices if a market is not maintained and the unitholder cannot find another purchaser a unitholder will be able to dispose of units by tendering them to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price see rights of unitholdersredemption of units a unitholder who wishes to dispose of his units should inquire of his broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof the trustee will notify the sponsor of any tender of units for redemption if the sponsors bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the redemption price per unit it may purchase the units not later than the day on which the units would otherwise have been redeemed by the trustee rights of unitholders  distributions of interest and principal interest received by a trust pro rated on an annual basis will be distributed monthly unless a unitholder elects to receive quarterly or semiannual distributions certain trusts

itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these funds nor to make a distribution from the principal account unless the amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least  per unit however should the amount available for distribution in the principal account equal or exceed  per unit the trustee will make a special distribution from the principal account on the next monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the related monthly record date because interest payments are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year interest distributions may be more or less than the amount credited to the interest account as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions the trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the interest account on the next record date

federal tax status  grantor trusts this section summarizes some of the principal us federal income tax consequences of owning units of a trust that has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes please see notes to financial statements in prospectus part i tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer a taxexempt enitity or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the irs could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust the trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its compliance and reporting obligations as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust the trust will hold various debt obligations the bonds of state and local governmental entities that constitute debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes as described below it is possible that the trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg interest accruals of original issue discount and market discount and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses exclusion from gross income of interest at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities based on certain representations and subject to compliance with certain covenants neither the sponsor nor its counsel have made any special review for the trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds the bases for the bond counsel opinions or compliance with the covenants required for taxexemption the irs has an ongoing program of auditing taxexempt obligations to determine whether in the view of the irs interest on such taxexempt obligations is includible in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes it cannot be predicted whether or not the irs will commence an audit of any of the bonds if an audit is commenced under current procedures of the irs unitholders may have no right to participate in such procedure if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received both prior to and after the date on which interest is determined to be taxable your pro rata share of interest on the bonds will be excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent that such interest would be excluded from your gross income if you directly owned the bonds however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax and the branch profits tax imposed on certain foreign corporations ownership of the units may result in collateral federal income tax consequences to certain unit holders including without limitation corporations subject to the branch profits tax financial institutions certain insurance companies certain s corporations individual recipients of social security or railroad retirement benefits and unit holders who may be deemed to have incurred or continued indebtedness to purchase or carry taxexempt obligations if you are a substantial user of the facilities financed with the proceeds of certain bonds or a related person to a substantial user you will not be able to exclude from your gross income interest with respect to these bonds substantial user and related person are defined under federal income tax law for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations interest on certain bonds is included as an item of tax preference in the case of certain corporations the alternative minimum tax depends upon the corporations alternative minimum taxable income amti which is the corporations taxable income with certain adjustments one of the adjustment items used in computing amti of a corporation excluding s corporations regulated investment companies real estate investment trusts remics or fasits is an amount equal to  of the excess of such corporations adjusted current earnings over an amount equal to its amti before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction adjusted current earnings includes all taxexempt interest including interest on all of the bonds in the trust in addition a branch profits tax is levied on the effectively connected earnings and profits of certain foreign corporations which include taxexempt interest such as interest on the bonds in the trust your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of accruals of original issue discount market discount premium and accrued interest as discussed below if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  zero for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is scheduled generally to be   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code of  as amended the code however also treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations discount accrued interest and premium on bonds some bonds may have been issued with original issue discount this generally means that the bonds were originally issued at a price below their face or par value original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes thus the accrual of original discount will be excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent as interest on the bonds as discussed above your basis of each bond that was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original issue discount accrues some bonds may have been purchased by you or your trust at a market discount market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity for the bond over the purchase price of the bond market discount can arise based on the price your trust pays for a bond or based on the price you pay for your units market discount is taxed as ordinary income you will recognize this income when your trust receives principal payments on the bond when the bond is disposed of or redeemed or when you sell or redeem your units alternatively you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions alternatively some bonds may have been purchased by you or your trust at a premium generally if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any bond generally including sales charges exceeds the amount payable at maturity such excess is considered premium you must amortize bond premium on a constant yield basis over the remaining term of the bond in a manner that takes into account potential call dates and call prices you cannot deduct amortized bond premium relating to a bond the amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the taxexempt interest received as bond premium is amortized it reduces your basis in the bond the tax basis reduction requirement may result in your realizing a taxable gain when your units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than your cost if the price of your units includes accrued interest on a bond you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that bond when your trust receives this accrued interest you must treat it as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the bond this discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax treatment of original issue discount market discount and premium the rules however are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances for example the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the discussion set forth above in the case of bonds that were issued with original issue discount exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trusts for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical trust assets under the wash sale provisions of the code in kind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an in kind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units by electing to receive an in kind distribution you will receive trust assets plus possibly cash you will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole trust assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same trust assets held by your trust however if you also receive cash in exchange for a trust asset or a fractional portion of a trust asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such trust asset or fractional portion limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income your ability to deduct trust expenses is also limited to the extent the expenses are allocable to taxexempt interest from the trust regulated investment companies this section summarizes some of the

prospectus part i tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer a taxexempt entity or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the irs could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trusts a trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its compliance and reporting obligations as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status certain trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as regulated investment companies under the federal tax laws if a trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law such trust generally will not pay federal income taxes in addition such trusts intend to hold a sufficient amount of their assets in bonds that are exempt from us federal income taxation so as to qualify to distribute exemptinterest dividends to unitholders such exemptinterest dividends are not subject to regular us federal income tax but may be subject to the alternative minimum tax the trusts may hold bonds issued by the government of puerto rico or under its authority such bonds are exempt from taxation by the us federal government the government of puerto rico any state or its political subdivisions any possession of the united states or the district of columbia distributions after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that specifies your amounts of exemptinterest dividends ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends exemptinterest dividends generally are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes some or all of the exemptinterest dividends however may be taken into account in determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences eg they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are taxed ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction and qualified dividend income a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from a trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies an individual that owns units generally will not be entitled to treat dividends received from a trust as qualified dividend income currently taxed at longterm capital gains rates because it is not expected that such dividends will be attributable to qualified dividend income received by such trust sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units further if you hold your units for six months or less any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such a unit will be disallowed to the extent of the exemptinterest dividends you received capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  zero for taxpayers whose marginal federal income tax rate is in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gains currently is scheduled to be generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be disallowed to the extent of the exemptinterest dividends you received to the extent if any it is not disallowed it will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes in kind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an in kind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the irs could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted deductibility of trust expenses generally expenses incurred by your trust will be deducted from the gross income received by your trust and your share of the trusts net taxable income if any will be paid to you and reported as taxable income to you however if the units of your trust are held by fewer than  unitholders at any time during a taxable year your trust will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income thus resulting in your reported share of your trusts taxable income being increased by your share of those expenses even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution in this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income further because the trusts pay exemptinterest dividends which are treated as exempt interest for federal income tax purposes you will not be able to deduct some of your interest expense for debt that you incur or continue to purchase or carry your units investors may be subject to state local or foreign

forth in this section at the time of the closing special connecticut tax counsel connecticut counsel to the trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing certain connecticut tax consequences under thenexisting connecticut income tax law to unitholders subject to connecticut income tax the assets of the trust will consist of obligations the bonds certain of the bonds have been issued by or on behalf of the state of connecticut or its political subdivisions or other public instrumentalities state or local authorities districts or similar public entities created under the laws of the state of connecticut connecticut bonds the balance of the bonds have been issued by or on behalf of entities classified for the relevant purposes as territories or possessions of the united states including one or more of puerto rico guam or the virgin islands the interest on the obligations of which federal law would prohibit connecticut from taxing if received directly by the unitholders certain connecticut bonds in the trust were issued prior to the enactment of the connecticut income tax on the connecticut taxable income of individuals trusts and estates the connecticut income tax therefore bond counsel to the issuers of such bonds did not opine as to the exemption of the interest on such bonds from such tax however the sponsor and connecticut counsel believe that such interest will be so exempt interest on other bonds in the trust if any is in the opinion of bond counsel to such issuers exempt from state taxation connecticut counsel rendered its opinion to the trust at closing which relied explicitly on the opinion of the trusts federal income tax counsel at closing regarding federal income tax matters that under thenexisting connecticut law the trust is not liable for any tax on or measured by net income imposed by the state of connecticut interest income from a connecticut bond or from a bond issued by united states territories or possessions the interest on which federal law would prohibit connecticut from taxing if received directly by a unitholder from the issuer thereof is not taxable under the connecticut income tax when any such interest is received by the trust or distributed by it to such a unitholder insurance proceeds received by the trust representing maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trust are not taxable under the connecticut income tax if and to the same extent as such interest would not be taxable thereunder if paid directly to the trust by the issuer of such bonds gains and losses recognized by a unitholder for federal income tax purposes upon the maturity redemption sale or other disposition by the trust of a bond held by the trust or upon the redemption sale or other disposition of a unit of the trust held by a unitholder are taken into account as gains or losses respectively for purposes of the connecticut income tax except that in the case of a unitholder holding a unit of the trust as a capital asset such gains and losses recognized upon the maturity redemption sale or exchange of a connecticut bond held by the trust are excluded from gains and losses taken into account for purposes of such tax and no opinion is expressed as to the treatment for purposes of such tax of gains and losses recognized to the extent attributable to connecticut bonds upon the redemption sale or other disposition by a unitholder of a unit of the trust held by him the portion of any interest income or capital gain of the trust that is allocable to a unitholder that is subject to the connecticut corporation business tax is includible in the gross income of such unitholder for purposes of such tax and an interest in a unit of the trust that is owned by or attributable to a connecticut resident at the time of his death is includible in his gross estate for purposes of the connecticut succession tax and the connecticut estate tax generally a unitholder recognizes gain or loss for purposes of the connecticut income tax to the same extent as the unitholder recognizes gain or loss for federal income tax purposes ordinarily this would mean that gain or loss would be recognized by a unitholder upon the maturity redemption sale or other disposition by the trust of a bond held by it or upon the redemption sale or other disposition of a unit of the trust held by the unitholder however gains and losses from the sale or exchange of connecticut bonds held as capital assets are not taken into account for purposes of this tax regulations indicate that this rule would

purposes the trust will not be recognized as an association taxable as a corporation but rather as a fiduciary whose income will not be subject to maryland state and local income taxation to the extent that interest and accrued original issue discount derived from the trust by a unitholder with respect to the bonds in the trust is excludable from federal gross income such interest will not be subject to maryland state or local income taxes interest paid to a financial institution will be subject to the maryland franchise tax in the case of taxpayers who are individuals maryland imposes an income tax on items of tax preference with reference to such items as defined in the code for purposes of calculating the federal alternative minimum tax interest paid on certain private activity bonds constitutes a tax preference item for the purpose of calculating the federal alternative minimum tax accordingly if the trust holds such bonds  of the interest on such bonds in excess of a threshold amount is taxable in maryland capital gain including gain realized by a unitholder from the redemption sale or other disposition of a unit will be included in the taxable base of unitholders

institution from the sale or exchange of bonds will be subject to the maryland franchise tax the opinion of maryland counsel rendered at closing related only to the treatment of the trust and the

closing special minnesota tax counsel minnesota counsel to the trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing certain minnesota tax consequences under thenexisting minnesota income tax law to unitholders subject to minnesota income tax the assets of the trust will consist of i interest from bonds issued by the state of minnesota and its political and governmental subdivisions municipalities and governmental agencies and instrumentalities the minnesota bonds and bonds issued by possessions of the united states including bonds issued by puerto rico authorities the possession bonds and together with the minnesota bonds the bonds which would be exempt from federal and minnesota income taxation when paid directly to an individual trust or estate ii gain on the disposition of such bonds and iii proceeds paid under certain insurance policies issued to the trustee or to the issuers of the bonds which represent maturing interest or principal payments on defaulted bonds held by the trustee neither the sponsor nor its counsel nor minnesota counsel has independently examined the bonds to be deposited in and held in the trust however although no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters it is assumed that i the bonds were validly issued ii the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and iii the interest thereon is exempt from the income tax imposed by minnesota that is applicable to individuals trusts and estates the minnesota income tax it should be noted that interest on the minnesota bonds is subject to tax in the case of corporations subject to the minnesota corporate franchise tax or the corporate alternative minimum tax and is a factor in the computation of the minimum fee applicable to financial institutions the opinion of minnesota counsel issued at closing did not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of minnesota for purposes of such opinion minnesota counsel assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition minnesota counsel assumed that with respect to the minnesota bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the minnesota bonds is exempt from the minnesota income tax and with respect to the possession bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the possession bonds and the interest thereon is exempt from all state and local income taxation neither the sponsor nor its counsel nor minnesota counsel made any review for the trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in connection therewith based upon the foregoing assumptions minnesota counsel rendered its opinion to the trust at closing that under thenexisting minnesota law the trust is not an association taxable as a corporation income on the bonds which is excludable from minnesota taxable income for purposes of the minnesota income tax when received by the trust and which would be excludable from minnesota taxable income for purposes of the minnesota income tax if received directly by a unitholder will be excludable from minnesota taxable income for purposes of the minnesota income tax when received by the trust and distributed to such unitholder to the extent that interest on certain bonds except with respect to possession bonds as to which no opinion is expressed if any is includible in the computation of alternative minimum taxable income for federal income tax purposes such interest will also be includible in the computation of alternative minimum taxable income for purposes of the minnesota alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals estates and trusts each unitholder of the trust will recognize gain or loss for minnesota income tax purposes if the trustee disposes of a bond whether by redemption sale or otherwise or if the unitholder redeems or sells units of the trust to the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such unitholder for federal income tax purposes tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in unitholders realizing taxable gain for minnesota income tax purposes when their units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost proceeds if any paid under individual insurance policies obtained by issuers of bonds or the trustee which represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the trustee will be excludable from minnesota net income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable from minnesota net income if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted obligation provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds and to the extent that interest derived from the trust by a unitholder with respect to any possession bonds would be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and would be exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to federal law if the unitholder directly owned the possession bonds such interest will not be subject to the minnesota income tax when distributed by the trust and received by the unitholders as noted above we have expressed no opinion as to the treatment of interest on the possession bonds for purposes of the minnesota corporate franchise tax or the alternative minimum tax or whether it is a factor in the computation of the minimum fee applicable to financial institutions although a federal statute currently provides that bonds issued by the government of puerto rico or by its authority are exempt from all state and local taxation the supreme court of minnesota has held that interest earned on bonds issued by the government of puerto rico may be included in taxable net income for purposes of computing the minnesota bank excise tax the state of minnesota could apply the same reasoning in determining whether interest on the possession bonds is subject to the taxes listed above on which we express no opinion minnesota counsel did not examine any of the bonds to be deposited and held in the trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto and minnesota counsel expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provisions of minnesota law neither the sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the bonds ownership of

opinions rendered in connection therewith south carolina counsel rendered its opinion to the trust at closing that under thenexisting south carolina law by the provision of paragraph j of section  of article  of the south carolina constitution revised  intangible personal property is specifically exempted from any and all ad valorem taxation pursuant to the provisions of sc code ann section b recodified as sc code ann section    as interpreted by south carolina revenue ruling   interest from obligations issued by the state of south carolina or any of its political subdivisions as well as interest derived from bonds issued by the governments of puerto rico guam and the virgin islands which is exempt from federal income taxes is exempt from income taxes and that the exemption so granted extends to all recipients of interest paid thereon through the trust this opinion does not extend to socalled  obligations the income of the trust would be treated as income to each unitholder of the trust in the proportion that the number of units of the trust held by the unitholder bears to the total number of units of the trust outstanding for this reason interest derived by the trust that would not be includible in income for south carolina income tax purposes when paid directly to a south carolina unitholder will be exempt from south carolina income taxation when received by the trust and attributed to such south carolina unitholder each unitholder will recognize gain or loss for south carolina state income tax purposes if the trustee disposes of a bond whether by sale payment on maturity retirement or otherwise or if the unitholder redeems or sells his unit the trust would be regarded under south carolina law as a common trust fund and therefore not subject to taxation under any income tax law of south carolina the above described opinion has been concurred in by an informal ruling of the south carolina tax commission pursuant to section  recodified as section  of the south carolina code except for the description of the south carolina tax treatment of interest derived from bonds issued by guam and the virgin islands in paragraph  listed above while the informal ruling does not address the south carolina tax treatment of interest from securities issued by those two us territories south carolina revenue ruling  specifically directs that interest derived from bonds issued by the governments of guam and the virgin islands is exempt from south carolina income taxes south carolina counsel expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other

counsel to the sponsor the tennessee taxing authorities could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section at the time of the closing special tennessee tax counsel tennessee counsel to the trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing certain tennessee tax consequences under thenexisting tennessee income tax law to unitholders subject to tennessee income tax the assets of the trust will consist of bonds issued by the state of tennessee or any county or any municipality or political subdivision thereof including any agency board authority or commission the interest on which is exempt from the hall income tax imposed by the state of tennessee the tennessee bonds or by the commonwealth of puerto rico the puerto rico bonds and together with the tennessee bonds the bonds under tennessee law a unit investment trust taxable as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes is entitled to special tennessee state tax treatment as more fully described below with respect to its proportionate share of interest income received or accrued with respect to the tennessee bonds tennessee law also provides an exemption for distributions made by a unit investment trust or mutual fund that are attributable to bonds or securities of the united states government or any agency or instrumentality thereof us government agency or instrumentality bonds if it were determined that the tennessee trust held assets other than tennessee bonds or us government agency or instrumentality bonds a proportionate share of distributions from the tennessee trust would be taxable to unitholders for tennessee income tax purposes further because this provision appears only to provide an exemption for distributions that relate to interest income distributions by the trust that relate to capital gains realized from the sale or redemption of tennessee bonds or us government agency or instrumentality bonds are likely to be treated as taxable dividends for purposes of the hall income tax however capital gains realized directly by a unitholder when the unitholder sells or redeems his unit will not be subject to the hall income tax the opinion set forth below assumes that the interest on the tennessee bonds if received directly by a unitholder would be exempt from the hall income tax under tennessee state law this opinion does not address the taxation of persons other than fulltime residents of the state of tennessee because this provision only provides an exemption for distributions attributable to interest on tennessee bonds or us government agency or instrumentality bonds it must be determined whether bonds issued by the government of puerto rico qualify as us government agency or instrumentality bonds for hall income tax purposes there is currently no published administrative interpretation or opinion of the attorney general of tennessee dealing with the status of distributions made by unit investment trusts such as the tennessee trust that are attributable to interest paid on bonds issued by the government of puerto rico however in a letter dated august   the commissioners letter the commissioner of the state of tennessee department of revenue advised that puerto rico would be an instrumentality of the us government and treated bonds issued by the government of puerto rico as us government agency or instrumentality bonds based on this conclusion the commissioner advised that distributions from a mutual fund attributable to investments in puerto rico bonds are exempt from the hall income tax both the sponsor and tennessee counsel for purposes of its opinion as set forth below have assumed based on the commissioners letter that bonds issued by the government of puerto rico are us government agency or instrumentality bonds however it should be noted that the position of the commissioner is not binding and is subject to change even on a retroactive basis the sponsor cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted into law affecting the tax status of tennessee trusts the occurrence of such an event could cause distributions of interest income from the trust to be subject to the hall income tax investors should consult their own tax advisors in this regard it is assumed for purposes of the discussion and opinion below that the bonds constitute debt for federal income tax purposes tennessee counsel rendered its opinion to the trust at closing that under thenexisting tennessee law for purposes of the hall income tax the tennessee excise tax imposed by section  the state corporate income tax and the tennessee franchise tax imposed by section  the trust will not be subject to such taxes for hall income tax purposes a proportionate share of such distributions from the trust to unitholders to the extent attributable to interest on the tennessee bonds based on the relative proportion of interest received or accrued attributable to tennessee bonds will be exempt from the hall income tax when distributed to such unitholders based on the commissioners letter distributions from the trust to unitholders to the extent attributable to interest on the puerto rico bonds based on the relative proportion of interest received or accrued attributable to the puerto rico bonds will be exempt from the hall income tax when distributed to such unitholders a proportionate share of distributions from the trust attributable to assets other than the bonds would not under current law be exempt from the hall income tax when distributed to unitholders for state corporate income tax purposes tennessee law does not provide an exemption for interest on tennessee bonds and requires that all interest excludable from federal gross income must be included in calculating net earnings subject to the state corporate income tax no opinion is expressed regarding whether such tax would be imposed on the earnings or distributions of the trust including interest on the bonds or gain realized upon the disposition of the bonds by the trust attributable to unitholders subject to the state corporate income tax however based upon prior written advice from the tennessee department of revenue earnings and distributions from the trust including interest on the tennessee bonds or gain realized upon the disposition of the tennessee bonds by the trust attributable to the unitholders should be exempt from the state corporate income tax the position of the tennessee department of revenue is not binding and is subject to change even on a retroactive basis each unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss for state corporate income tax purposes when the unitholder redeems or sells his units at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for accretion or any discount or amortization of any premium and other basis adjustments including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a unitholders share of interest if any accruing on bonds during the interval between the unitholders settlement date and the date such bonds are delivered to the trust if later tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in unitholders realizing taxable gain when the units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost for purposes of the tennessee property tax the trust will be exempt from taxation with respect to the bonds it holds as for the taxation of the units held by the unitholders although intangible personal property is not presently subject to tennessee taxation no opinion is expressed with regard to potential property taxation of the unitholders with respect to the units because the determination of whether property is exempt from such tax is made on a county by county basis the bonds and the units held by the unitholder will not be subject to tennessee sales and use taxes tennessee counsel expressed no opinion regarding whether insurance proceeds paid in lieu of interest on the bonds held by the trust including the tennessee bonds are exempt from the hall income tax distributions of such proceeds to unitholders may be subject to the hall income tax tennessee counsel did not examine any of the bonds to be deposited and held in the trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto and tennessee counsel expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provisions of tennessee law neither the sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the bonds ownership of units in the trust may result in other tennessee tax consequences to certain taxpayers and

capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of the state and its various regions and

disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section at the time of the closing special texas tax counsel texas counsel to the trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing certain texas tax consequences under thenexisting texas law to unitholders texas counsel rendered its opinion to the trust at closing that under thenexisting texas law neither texas nor any political subdivision of texas currently imposes an income tax on individuals therefore no portion of any distribution received by an individual unitholder of the trust in respect of his units including a distribution of the proceeds of insurance in respect of such units is subject to income taxation by texas or any political subdivision of texas except in the case of certain transportation businesses savings and loan associations and insurance companies no unit of the trust is taxable under any property tax levied in texas the inheritance tax of texas imposed upon certain transfers of property of a deceased resident individual unitholder may be measured in part upon the value of units of the trust included in the estate of such unitholder and with respect to any unitholder which is subject to texas corporate franchise tax units in the trust held by such unitholder and distributions received therein will be taken into account in computing the taxable capital of the unitholder allocated to texas one of the bases by which such franchise tax is currently measured the other being a corporations net capital earned surplus which is generally its net corporate income plus officers and directors income the opinion set forth in clause  above was limited by texas counsel to the extent that units of the trust may be subject to property taxes levied in texas if held on the relevant date i by a transportation business described in vtca tax code subchapter a chapter  ii by a savings and loan association formed under the laws of the state but only to the extent described in section  of the texas savings and loan act vernons ann civ st art a or iii by an insurance company incorporated under the laws of texas but only to the extent described in vats insurance code art  each unitholder described in the preceding sentence should consult its own tax advisor with respect to such matters for texas tax reports due on or after january   texas enacted the franchise margin tax which reformed the texas franchise tax and extended the tax to certain active businesses broadened the tax base and lowered the tax rate an entity subject to the franchise margin tax generally uses federal gross income which would not include interest on obligations exempt from tax for federal income tax purposes or exemptinterest dividends derived therefrom as the starting point for calculating its net taxable margin which is then reduced by three possible calculations the lowest of which is the entitys net taxable margin it is not likely that exempt interest distributed by the trust would increase a unitholders franchise margin tax liability however unitholders subject to the franchise margin tax should consult their tax advisors to determine whether based on such unitholders individual circumstances such unitholder would be subject to the franchise margin tax with respect to respect to distributions from the trust attributable to interest on the obligations held by the trust or to dispositions of trust assets or to the redemption or other disposition of units in the trust as well as the applicability of other texas state or local tax laws texas counsel expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provisions of texas law neither the sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the

its counsel nor virginia counsel made any review for the trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in connection therewith based upon the foregoing virginia counsel rendered its opinion to the trust at closing that under thenexisting virginia law the trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for purposes of the virginia income tax and each unitholder of the trust will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the assets held by the trust and the income of such portion of the virginia trust will be treated as income of the unitholder for purposes of the virginia income tax interest on the virginia bonds which is exempt from virginia income tax when received by the trust and which would be exempt from virginia income tax if received directly by a unitholder will retain its status as exempt from such tax when received by the trust and distributed to such unitholder interest on the possession bonds which is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to federal law when received by the trust will be exempt from virginia income taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income of the unitholder for virginia income tax purposes when distributed by the trust and received by the unitholders the virginia legislature has enacted a law effective july   that would exempt from the virginia income tax income derived on the sale or exchange of obligations of the commonwealth of virginia or any political subdivision or instrumentality of the commonwealth of virginia however virginia law does not address whether this exclusion would apply to gains recognized through entities such as the virginia trust accordingly we express no opinion as to the treatment for virginia income tax purposes of any gain or loss recognized by a unitholder for federal income tax purposes the virginia income tax does not permit a deduction of interest paid on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units in the trust to the extent that interest income related to the ownership of units is exempt from

that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest however the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited by provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entitys credit will depend on many factors some such factors are the entitys tax base the extent to which the entity relies on federal or state aid and other factors which are beyond the entitys control revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors housing bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured multifamily housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to housing projects for low to moderate income families single family mortgage revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income the ability of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be affected by various economic and noneconomic factors such factors include occupancy levels adequate rental income in multifamily projects the rate of default on mortgage loans underlying single family issuers and the ability of mortgage insurers to pay claims mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds these bonds were issued under section a of the internal revenue code which section contains certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in connection with the housing bonds held by a trust the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates health care bonds certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs it also may be necessary for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its facilities equipment personnel and services hospitals and other health care facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that a claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that insurance coverage will be available to a facility public utility and wholesale electric bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds

problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs

of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances industrial revenue bonds certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected lease obligation bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefore a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult higher educations and public education bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers airport and transportation bonds certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints acts of terrorism and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents waste disposal bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds original issue discount bonds certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced a bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates see federal tax status in prospectus part ii market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest when as and if issued bonds certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis the delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery to the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a trust after their respective expected dates of delivery unitholders who purchase their units prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee would be required to adjust their tax basis in their units for a portion of the interest accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of units and the actual delivery of such bonds as a result of any such adjustment the estimated current returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated in the prospectus which would be the returns after the first year assuming the portfolio of a trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the trustee which may be reduced in the first year only do not vary from that set forth in prospectus part i unitholders will be at risk with respect to all bonds in the portfolios including when as and if issued and delayed delivery bonds ie may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such bonds from the date they commit for units redemption or sale prior to maturity certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise a sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement of debt a callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new debt obligation in general call provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the current return on units of the trust involved each trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions if any with respect to each of the debt obligations extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of certain events generally events that may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include among others a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used an exercise by a local state or federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities such as taxes not imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds an administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds the issuer of certain bonds in a trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such bonds in such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights the sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon any of the trusts at any time after the date of deposit litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds insurance on the bonds in the insured trusts insurance has been obtained by each insured trust by the issuer of bonds in certain trusts by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such trust see the trustsobjectives and bond selection in prospectus part ii the portfolio insurers if any and the preinsured bond insurers are described under portfolio and notes to portfolio in prospectus part i the portfolio insurers if any are set forth in the prospectus an insurance policy obtained by an insured trust if any is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as such trust is in existence the respective portfolio insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such trust see portfolio for the respective insured trust in prospectus part i any portfolio insurance premium for an insured trust which is an obligation of such trust is paid by such trust on a monthly basis nonpayment of premiums on a policy obtained by an insured trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it the trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such trust premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by a policy obtained by an insured trust if any are fixed for the life of the trust the premium for any preinsured bond insurance has been paid by such issuer by a prior owner of such bonds or the sponsor and any such policy or policies are noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the respective preinsured bond insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the portfolio insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events the aforementioned portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust if any guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due for the purposes of insurance obtained by an insured trust when due generally means the stated payment or maturity date for the payment of principal and interest however in the event a an issuer of a bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond b such issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or c the maturity of such bond is accelerated the affected portfolio insurer has the option in its sole discretion after receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond from the affected trust prior to such bonds stated maturity date the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units insurance obtained by an insured trust if any is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the portfolio insurers the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by an insured trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee would exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise the affected trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basis the insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond as of the date of deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond the sponsor believes that the permanent insurance option provides an advantage to an insured trust in that each bond insured by a trust insurance policy may be sold out of the affected trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto thus the value of the insurance if any at the time of sale can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold which is not the case in connection with any value attributable to an insured trusts portfolio insurance see public offeringoffering price in prospectus part ii because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the permanent insurance option the sponsor anticipates that a in the event an insured trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default it is much less likely that such trust would need at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of units than if such trust were to have no such option see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in prospectus part ii and b at the time of termination of an insured trust if such trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default such trust would not need to hold such securities until their respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of such trusts portfolio insurance see trust administrationtermination of trust agreement in prospectus part ii except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bonds not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringoffering price in prospectus part ii it is also the present intention of the trustee not to sell such bonds to effect redemptions or for any other reason but rather to retain them in the portfolio because value attributable to the insurance cannot be realized upon sale see public offeringoffering price in prospectus part ii for a more complete description of an insured trusts method of valuing defaulted bonds and bonds which have a significant risk of default insurance obtained by the issuer of a bond is effective so long as such bond is outstanding therefore any such insurance may be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to the bonds thus insured but the exact effect if any of this insurance on such market value cannot be predicted the portfolio insurance policy or policies obtained by an insured trust if any with respect to the bonds in such trust were issued by one or more of the portfolio insurers any other preinsured bond insurance policy or commitment therefore was issued by one of the preinsured bond insurers see the trustsobjectives and bond selection in prospectus part ii aca financial guaranty corporation aca financial guaranty

its name to cifg in  on march   moodys downgraded to a from aaa the insurance financial strength ratings of cifg these rating actions reflect moodys assessment of cifgs weakened capitalization impaired business opportunities and uncertain strategic direction as a result in part of its exposures to the us residential mortgage market the rating outlook is stable moodys believes that cifgs significant exposure to the mortgage sector especially abs cdos is indicative of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a aaa rating going forward the companys participation in several mezzanine abs cdos in particular contributed to this view the rating agency noted that cifg is implementing significant changes to its governance and risk management to address some of the shortcomings of its prior strategy moodys added that cifg as the smallest and most recent entrant to the financial guaranty sector has not yet established a market position on par with its larger competitors and that the ongoing credit stress at the firm significantly weakened its franchise raising questions about the degree to which it will be able to regain market traction within a reasonable timeframe cifgs profitability is likely to remain weak over the near to intermediate term particularly given the losses that are likely to be generated by its insurance portfolio the expected reduced issuance volume and the limited inforce book of business said moodys on june   sp lowered its financial strength financial enhancement and issuer credit ratings on cifg to a from a the outlooks remain negative reflecting reservations regarding the companys ability to maintain its position as a viable competitor in the bond insurance industry given its current staffing levels and

rating outlook is negative fitch believes that it will be very difficult to stabilize the ratings of cifg until the company can more effectively limit the downside risk from its sf cdos through reinsurance or other risk mitigation initiatives fitch does not anticipate removing the negative rating outlook over the near to intermediateterm until the ultimate risk of loss on the sf cdo

this payment upon receipt of proof of ownership of the obligations due as well as upon receipt of instruments appointing the insurer as agent for the holders and evidencing the assignment of the rights of the holders with respect to the payments made by the insurer because mbia corp generally guarantees to the holder of the underlying obligation the timely payment of amounts due on such obligation in accordance with its original payment schedule in the case of a default on an insured obligation payments under the insurance policy cannot be accelerated against mbia corp except in certain limited circumstances unless mbia corp consents to the acceleration in the event of a default however mbia corp may have the right in its sole discretion to accelerate the obligations and pay them in full otherwise mbia corp is required to pay principal interest or other amounts only as originally scheduled payments come due typically even if the holders are permitted by the terms of the insured obligations to have the full amount of principal accrued interest or other amounts due declared due and payable immediately in the event of a default mbia corp is required to pay only the amounts scheduled to be paid but not in fact paid on each originally scheduled payment date mbia corps payment obligations after a default vary by deal and by insurance type there are three primary

made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof the extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by jurisdiction but new york and most other jurisdictions have laws and regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of dividends transactions with affiliates mergers consolidations acquisitions or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings in order to be in an insured trust bonds must be insured by one of the preinsured bond insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by such trust in determining eligibility for insurance the preinsured bond insurers and the portfolio insurers if any have applied their own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of bonds by the sponsor to the extent the standards of the preinsured bond insurers and the portfolio insurers are more restrictive than those of the sponsor the previously stated trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds this decision is made prior to the date of deposit as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an insured trust thus all of the bonds in the portfolios of the insured trusts are insured either by the respective trust or by the issuer of the bonds by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust an objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust if any is to obtain a higher yield on the portfolio of such trust than would be available if all the bonds in such portfolio had an sp aaa rating and yet at the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and principal when due on the bonds there is of course no certainty that this result will be achieved preinsured bonds in an insured trust all of which are rated aaa by sp may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds rated aaa by sp in selecting such bonds for an insured trust the sponsor has applied the criteria hereinbefore described in the event of nonpayment of interest or principal when due in respect of a bond a portfolio insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened but not earlier than the date such payment is due the insurer as regards any payment it may make will succeed to the rights of the trustee in respect thereof all policies issued by the portfolio insurers and the preinsured bond insurers if any are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an insured trust are concerned the internal revenue service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal obligations paid to holders of insured bonds under policy provisions substantially identical to the policies described herein will be excludable from federal gross income under section a of the internal revenue code to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal obligations holders of units in an insured trust should discuss with their tax advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling however counsel for the sponsor at the time of the closing of the insured trust had given an opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from federal gross income to the extent described under federal tax status in prospectus part ii each portfolio insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business such regulation however is no guarantee that each portfolio insurer will be able to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some time in the future at the date hereof it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the portfolio insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance the information relating to each portfolio insurer if any has been furnished by such companies the financial information with respect to each portfolio insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities no representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof portfolio administration the trustee is empowered to sell for the purpose of redeeming units tendered by any unitholder and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be available such of the bonds designated by the supervisor as the trustee in its sole discretion may deem necessary the supervisor in designating such bonds will consider a variety of factors including a interest rates b market value and c marketability the sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of bonds upon default in payment of principal or interest institution of certain legal proceedings default under other documents adversely affecting debt service default in payment of principal or interest or other obligations of the same issuer decline in projected income pledged for debt service on revenue bonds or decline in price or the occurrence of other market or credit factors including advance refunding ie the issuance of refunding securities and the deposit of the proceeds thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded securities on their respective redemption dates so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of the unitholders in connection with the insured trusts to the extent that bonds are sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds the overall quality of the bonds remaining in such trusts portfolio will tend to diminish except as described in this section and in certain other unusual circumstances for which it is determined by the trustee to be in the best interests of the unitholders or if there is no alternative the trustee is not empowered to sell bonds from an insured trust which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default and for which value has been attributed for the insurance obtained by such insured trust because of restrictions on the trustee under certain circumstances the sponsor may seek a full or partial suspension of the right of unitholders to redeem their units in an insured trust see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in prospectus part ii the sponsor is empowered but not obligated to direct the trustee to dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan except that the sponsor may instruct the trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto as the sponsor may deem proper if  the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or  in the written opinion of the sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the reasonably foreseeable future any obligation so received in exchange or substitution will be held by the trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the trust agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder within five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying bonds the trustee is required to give notice thereof to each unitholder of the trust thereby affected identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefore except as stated herein and under fund administrationreplacement bonds in prospectus part ii regarding the substitution of replacement bonds for failed bonds the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the bonds initially deposited is not permitted if any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs and no provision for payment is made therefore within  days the trustee is required to notify the sponsor thereof if the sponsor fails to instruct the trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within  days after notification by the trustee to the sponsor of such default the trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby

its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it shall make distribution thereof to unitholders in the same manner notwithstanding the foregoing in connection with final distributions to unitholders of an insured trust it should be noted that because the portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust if any is applicable only while bonds so insured are held by such trust the price to be received by such trust upon the disposition of any such bond which is in default by reason of nonpayment of principal or interest will not reflect any value based on such insurance therefore in connection with any liquidation it shall not be necessary for the trustee to and the trustee does not currently intend to dispose of any bond or bonds if retention of such bond or bonds until due shall be deemed to be in the best interest of unitholders including but not limited to situations in which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from a significant risk of default since the preinsured bonds will reflect the value of the related insurance it is the present intention of the sponsor not to direct the trustee to hold any of such preinsured bonds after the date of termination all proceeds received less applicable expenses from insurance on defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be distributed to unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the trustee description of ratings standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies a standard  poors municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond this assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price the ratings are based on current information furnished to standard  poors by the issuer and obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the bond in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaathis is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the

investors service inc a brief description of the applicable moodys rating symbols and their meanings follows aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payment and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well moodysr applies numerical modifiers   and  in each

should reach taxpayers beginning in may  also to help the housing market especially in california the caps on freddie mac and fannie mae loans were raised for one year it is hoped that these actions will be enough of an economic stimulus to avoid a national recession in  as of mid it appears the housing market has still not reached the bottom and economic growth in the state is expected to remain slow in the second half of  and in  in the  fiscal year the state has lost jobs in eight out of ten months with losses over the period totaling   an average of  jobs a month while indicative of an economy functioning at less than full potential the magnitude of recent job losses are far from recessionary in scale the data continues to show that the housing and real estate sector has been the key source of the slowdown in the states job growth over the last two years although the pace of yearover job growth slowed in may  the nonhousing segment of the economy has sustained job growth

continued to risethough by only a modest  increase in some regions of california and particularly in san diego prices were beginning to decline more troubling signs were also being seen as foreclosures in california more than doubled in the last quarter of  compared to the last quarter of  the problems were concentrated in the subprime portion of the marketloans made to highrisk borrowers in particular those subprime loans that were experiencing a reset to higher interest rates were seeing escalating delinquency rates evidence of a major crack in the foundations of the real

payable budgetary control californias annual budget is prepared primarily on a modified accrual basis for governmental funds the governor recommends a budget for approval by the california legislature each year this recommended budget includes estimated revenues however revenues are not included in the annual budget bill adopted by the california legislature under state law the state cannot adopt a spending plan that exceeds estimated revenues under the state constitution money may be drawn from the treasury only through a legal appropriation the appropriations contained in the budget act as approved by the california legislature and signed by the governor are the primary sources of annual expenditure authorizations and establish the legal level of control for the annual operating budget the budget can be amended throughout the year by special legislative action budget revisions by the california department of finance or executive orders of the governor appropriations are generally available for expenditure or encumbrance either in the year appropriated or for a period of three years if the legislation does not specify a period of availability at the end of the availability period the encumbering authority for the unencumbered balance lapses some appropriations continue indefinitely while others are available until fully spent generally encumbrances must be liquidated within two years from the end of the period in which the appropriation is available if the encumbrances are not liquidated within this additional twoyear period the spending authority for these encumbrances lapses state agencies are responsible for exercising basic budgetary control and ensuring that appropriations are not overspent the state controllers office is responsible for overall appropriation control and does not allow expenditures in excess of authorized appropriations financial activities are mainly controlled at the appropriation level but can vary depending on the presentation and wording contained in the budget act certain items that are established at the category program component or element level can be adjusted by the california department of finance for example an appropriation for support may have detail accounts for personal services operating expenses and equipment and reimbursements the california department of finance can authorize adjustments between the detail accounts but cannot increase the amount of the overall support appropriation while the financial activities are controlled at various levels the legal level of budgetary control or the extent to which management may amend the budget without seeking approval of the governing body has been established in the budget act for the annual operating budget cash management cash

anticipation warrants raws risk management the state government has elected with a few exceptions to be selfinsured against loss or liability generally the exceptions are when a bond resolution or a contract requires the state government to purchase commercial insurance for coverage against property loss or liability there have been no significant reductions in insurance coverage from the prior year in addition no insurance settlement in the last three years has exceeded insurance coverage the state government generally does not maintain reserves losses are covered by appropriations from each fund responsible for payment in the year in which the payment occurs all claim payments are on a pay as you go basis with workers compensation benefits for selfinsured agencies being initially paid by the state compensation insurance fund the potential amount of loss arising from risks other than workers compensation benefits is not considered material in relation to the state governments financial position the discounted liability for unpaid selfinsured workers compensation losses is estimated to be  billion as of june   this estimate is based on actuarial reviews of the states employee workers compensation program and includes indemnity payments to claimants as well as all other costs of providing workers compensation benefits such as medical care and rehabilitation the estimate also includes the liability for unpaid services fees industrial disability leave benefits and incurredbutnotreported amounts the estimated total liability of approximately  billion is discounted to  billion using a  interest rate of the total  million is a current liability of which  million is included in the general fund  million in the special revenue funds and  million in the internal service funds the remaining  billion is reported as other noncurrent liabilities in the governmentwide statement of net assets proposed budget  the governor released his proposed budget on january   the  proposed spending plan assuming all proposed budget reductions are enacted totals  billion this spending plan represents estimated general fund expenditures of  billion special fund expenditures of  billion and bond fund expenditures of  billion proposed general fund expenditures are  less than the  billion expenditures estimated for the  fiscal year the governors budget projects to end the  fiscal year with a  billion general fund reserve in the special fund for economic uncertainties the governor suspended the annual transfer to the budget stabilization account required by proposition  passed by californias voters in  proposition  requires that beginning in the  fiscal year the state transfer into the budget stabilization account by september  of each year a specified portion of estimated general fund revenues until the account balance reaches  billion or  of the estimated general fund revenues whichever is greater absent an executive order by the governor in the  overview of the governors budget the legislative analysts office lao states that the governors budget revenue forecast is generally reasonable and the spending proposals are built upon solid assumptions about caseload and program requirements however the lao added that considering recent cash trends and economic reports there are some risks in the governors assumptions the proposed budget continues to demonstrate an annual operating shortfall whereby the general funds operating expenses exceed its revenue proposed budgetbalancing solutions include issuing  billion of additional deficitfinancing bonds actually issued on february   suspending the planned supplementary payments for early redemption of  billion of outstanding deficitfinancing bonds accruing in fiscal year   billion of the personal income and corporation tax revenue that will be received in fiscal year  reducing k education spending by  million and suspending the proposition  minimumfunding guarantee resulting in  billion additional savings in education spending and reducing spending in most state programs through  billion in acrosstheboard reductions ratings as of july  all outstanding general

assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn local issuances it should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by local california issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of obligations issued by the state of california and there is no obligation on the part of the state to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default litigation the state is a party to numerous legal proceedings many of which normally occur in governmental operations in addition the state is involved in certain other legal proceedings that if decided against the state might require the state to make significant future expenditures or impair future revenue sources because of the prospective nature of these proceedings it is not presently possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or estimate the potential impact on the ability of the state to pay debt service costs on its obligations on march   the court of appeal first appellate district ruled in computer service tax cases dell inc v state board of equalization that the state board of equalization improperly collected sales and use tax on optional service contracts that dell inc sold with computers the decision will lead to a judgment requiring the board to refund the tax with interest the amount of the refund has not been determined but with interest may exceed  million which would be made in the  fiscal year on august   a lawsuit titled california teachers association et al v arnold schwarzenegger et al was filed plaintiffs  california teachers association california superintendent of public instruction jack oconnell and various other individuals  alleged that the california constitutions minimum school funding guarantee was not followed for the  fiscal year and the  fiscal year in the aggregate amount of approximately  billion plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate requiring the state to recalculate the minimumfunding guarantee in compliance with the california constitution on may   counsel for all parties executed a settlement agreement and the action was stayed pending implementation legislation on september

obligations colorado risk factors general the colorado legislatures otherwise plenary power is checked by the requirement for the governors signature of its legislation and by specific limitations placed in the state constitution by voters the most significant fiscal limitation is the restriction related to issuing debt raising taxes and changing existing spending limits from a fiscal perspective the joint budget committee of the legislature because of its preparation of the annual budget and supplemental appropriations bills holds the most important power vested in the legislature the committee is bipartisan with members drawn from each of the houses of the legislature the governors office of state planning and budgeting ospb develops an executive branch budget proposal but there is no requirement for the joint budget committee to adopt that proposal economic outlook colorados economy continues to outperform the national economy in most major benchmarks such as income

and renewable has been far more positive oil prices have also made renewable energy producers more economically competitive the cluster of major research universities and federal laboratories on the front range has become a magnet for privatesector ventures in renewable energy it appears this sector will lead the way for economic growth in colorado for the foreseeable future due to economic concerns at the national level and an imbalance in real interest rates compared to other developed nations the value of the dollar has fallen dramatically against benchmark currencies such as the euro the pound sterling and the yen this has hurt consumers by exacerbating price increases in energy food and other commodities however it has been a boon for exporters and for foreign direct investment the weak dollar made a good ski season even better as additional foreign tourists visited colorado in addition the weak dollar makes land buildings and labor relatively inexpensive for foreign companies and has recently encouraged significant highprofile investment in colorado by foreign firms such as siemens ag vestas wind systems as brisa bp plc royal dutchshell encana and brookfield

is constitutionally prohibited from issuing general obligation debt however the state has issued certificates of participation cops secured by buildings and vehicles and has issued revenue bonds that are secured by pledges of future revenues in some instances the debtfinanced asset generates the pledged revenue stream in other instances such as the transportation revenue anticipation notes the pledged revenue stream is future federal revenues and state highway users taxes the state has other forms of borrowing that are small in relation to the revenue bonds and cops except for exempt enterprises the taxpayers bill of rights tabor amendment requires a vote of the people for the creation of any debt unless existing cash reserves are irrevocably pledged to service the debt the amendment does allow debt issuance to refinance a borrowing at a lower interest rate these requirements limit managements ability to address revenue shortfalls by borrowing for capital expenditures risk management the state selfinsures its agencies officials and employees against the risk of loss related to general liability motor vehicle liability and workers compensation property claims are not selfinsured as the state has purchased insurance the state uses the general fund to account for the risk management function including operations and all matured claims or judgments medical claims for officials and employees are managed through the group benefits plan fund a pension and employee benefits trust fund that also became selfinsured during the  fiscal year the regents of the university of colorado the board of governors of the colorado state university system and the board of trustees of university of northern colorado individually manage the risks to which they are exposed and do not participate in the states risk management fund risks to the colorado forecast although colorado will fare better than the rest of the country it cannot be totally insulated from broader economic issues ongoing corrections in local real estate markets outside colorado will indirectly impact colorado as fewer people will be able to afford to travel to or buy second homes in colorado the ongoing repricing of risk will impact colorado in subtle ways by raising the interest rates at which local governments can float bonds raising the costs to start or expand a business and raising the costs to finance the purchase of a home experts contend that the true magnitude of the subprime problem is vastly larger than what has already been announced through the writedown of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bad debts further weakness in the banking sector could cause businesses and consumers in colorado to find it more difficult to borrow money which would definitely have a negative impact on colorados economy local issuances it should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by local colorado issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of obligations issued by the state of colorado and there is no obligation on the part of the state to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default ratings as of july

obtained from various state and local agencies in colorado or contained in official statements for various colorado municipal obligations connecticut risk factors general connecticut has no system of county government below the state level governing units consist of  municipalities the general statutes of connecticut provide procedures for the creation of many types of local special purpose authorities districts and similar bodies under connecticut law all municipal governmental bodies have only the powers specifically granted to them by the state and the ancillary powers that are necessarily implied by the powers explicitly granted economic condition and outlook after almost eight years of solid economic growth connecticut began to experience job losses in fiscal year  between fiscal years  and  the state lost over  payroll jobs after three successive years of job losses in fiscal year  the state again experienced gains in payroll employment and by the end of fiscal year  had regained most of the jobs lost during the recession connecticut ended fiscal year  with a relatively low unemployment rate of  percent business professional and financial services account for over  percent of total employment in the state and retail and wholesale trade account for an additional  percent these job sectors experienced solid growth during fiscal year  strong job growth was also seen in the leisure and hospitality sector manufacturing employment has continued to decline following a trend that began over a decade ago although the sector still accounts for over  percent of total payroll employment connecticut continues to lead the nation with per capita income of  which is almost  percent above the national level connecticuts personal income has been growing at a rate of close to  percent and in fiscal year  hourly wages increased by  percent connecticuts strong income growth has helped fuel the tax revenues that created budget surpluses over the past four fiscal years like most other states connecticut has been experiencing a recent slow down in housing activities with permits and new home sales declining as at the national level connecticuts economy is expected to slow in  with stagnant employment and modest income growth connecticut is expected to slightly outperform the national economy due to its strong income base and the diversification of its industries the fiscal year  budget submitted by the governor recognizes this slowing growth trend major policy initiatives and priorities tax cuts enacted tax cuts reduced fiscal year  general fund revenue by over  million the tax cuts were targeted to individuals and businesses the largest dollar tax reductions were on the individual income tax the property tax credit that could be claimed on the income tax was raised from a maximum of  to  and a deduction was added for contributions to the connecticut higher education trust fund the sales tax free period for residential weatherization purchases was extended by two months business taxes were reduced by eliminating a  percent corporation tax surcharge tax credits were also added to encourage businesses to locate in connecticut and to hire displaced workers reducing longterm liabilities with surplus dollars the state has committed in excess of half a billion dollars of fiscal year  and  surplus to reducing the unfunded liability in the teachers retirement fund a state sponsored retirement program for municipal and state teachers the percentage of liabilities covered by assets in the fund had slipped over time from just over  percent to just below  percent these additional contributions are intended to increase the funding level and reduce the states longterm liability in this area the state also committed  million of fiscal year  surplus to prefund the other post employment benefits opeb liability that will be reported on the financial statements beginning in fiscal year  these liabilities relate to health insurance benefits extended by the state to its retirees in fiscal year  all states will be required to report such liabilities as they do now with pension obligations this is a first step by the state to acknowledge the need to advance fund these benefits longterm planning future spending plans include several major projects that are on the horizon for example at the beginning of the new fiscal year the state bond commission granted approval to sell bonds to build new infrastructure throughout the state the governor and legislature have committed longterm funding to improve the states roads and highways and public transportation systems this commitment resulted in the sale by the treasurer in october  of special tax obligation bonds in the amount of  million it is expected that special legislation will continue to empower the state bond commission to authorize additional financing of the infrastructure program each year other bond commission approvals were granted that provide for better housing school facilities and the continuation work on waste and drinking water control projects budgetary and other control systems in november  electors approved an amendment to the state constitution providing that the amount of general budget expenditures authorized for any fiscal year shall not exceed the estimated amount of revenue for such fiscal year this amendment also provided a framework for placing a cap on budgeted appropriations annual budgeted appropriations are capped at a percentage increase that is based on either the fiveyear average annual growth in the states personal income or inflation whichever is higher debt service payments certain statutory grants to distressed municipalities and appropriations required by federal mandate or court order are excluded from the limits of the cap the spending cap can be lifted if the governor declares the existence of extraordinary circumstances and the general assembly by a threefifths vote approves appropriations in excess of the cap this has occurred in several fiscal years to allow direct appropriations of surplus to be substituted for debt financing and other permit other spending initiatives from surplus funds budget control is maintained at the individual appropriation account level by agency as established in authorized appropriation bills the allotment process exercises control over obligations or commitments the governor through his budget office allots funds for both budgeted and nonbudgeted accounts and funds the governor is permitted to modify appropriations through the allotment process under certain circumstances and within percentage limitations specified by the general assembly elected officials agency commissioners directors of public benefit corporations and agency managers are responsible for establishing internal control structures good internal control systems ensure that resource use is consistent with laws regulations and policies resources are safeguarded against waste loss and misuse and reliable data are obtained maintained and fairly disclosed in reports the office of the state comptroller has worked to improve the overall internal control environment in state government this work has included improvements to the central state accounting system that advance internal control efforts revenues and expenses total revenues for the governmental activities increased by  billion to  billion this increase was due mainly to an increase in tax revenue of  billion being offset by a decrease in operating and capital grants of  billion total expenses increased by  billion to  billion this increase can be attributed mainly to increases in general government and education expenses of  billion even though total revenues exceeded total expenses by  million this excess was reduced by transfers of  million resulting in an increase of net assets of  million as noted above total revenue increased by  percent during the fiscal year reflecting continued economic growth both state and national economic indicators were generally positive during the fiscal year preliminary estimates showed that  jobs were added to the state economy during the fiscal year and the unemployment rate was a relatively low  percent in the third quarter of the fiscal year the state had the second highest personal income growth in the nation with a  percent increase annualized personal income growth through the same quarter was over  percent retail sales grew  percent while major stock indexes grew at double digit rates and corporate profit growth was solid during the fiscal year the housing market continued to show signs of weakness during the fiscal year both nationally and in the state total revenues and expenses of businesstype activities were virtually unchanged between fiscal years  and  although total expenses exceeded total revenues by  million this deficiency was offset by transfers of  million resulting in an increase in net assets of  million capital assets as of june   the state had an investment in total capital assets net of accumulated depreciation of  billion during the fiscal year capital assets of governmental activities and businesstype activities increased by  million and  million respectively depreciation charges for the fiscal year totaled  billion debt the state pursuant to various public and special acts has authorized a variety of types of debt which fall into the following categories direct general obligation debt which is payable from the states general fund special tax obligation debt which is payable from the debt service fund and revenue debt which is payable from specific revenues of enterprise funds in fiscal year  the state increased outstanding bonds by  million bonds of governmental activities increased by  million while bonds of businesstype activities increased by  million the states general obligation bonds are rated aa aa and aa by moodys sp and fitch respectively special tax obligation bonds are rated aaa aaa aaa by moodys sp and fitch respectively section  of the connecticut general statutes provides that the total amount of bonds notes or other

fiscal policies include reserves that may be utilized to meet floridas tax revenue shortfalls the fund balance reserved for budget stabilization is intended to cover revenue shortfalls and emergencies as defined by law economic outlook floridas economy is currently experiencing a decline in overall rates of growth and a significant downturn in its housing market the rate of job creation outside the agricultural sector has slowed by almost two percent compared to the prior year population growth the historical major driving force behind floridas economy is showing signs of leveling off for the first time in decades rates of unemployment have increased slightly downward trends in consumer spending and real estate sales are resulting in either flat or declining general tax revenues to the state government property insurance bills for florida homeowners have not decreased as expected when lawmakers passed legislation to shift a portion of catastrophic risk from private insurance markets to the state government homeowners are also feeling pressure from higher property tax bills as local governments generated revenues to handle the needs of rapidly increasing populations in the past general fund tax collections for the fiscal year ended june   were  percent lower than the prior fiscal year sales tax collections the states primary source of general revenue were essentially flat showing only minor growth from the prior year this is primarily due to a decline in consumer spending related to rebuilding after the hurricane events of  and  as well as declining spending levels related to recordlevel rates of housing construction which peaked in  collections of documentary stamp taxes which result from sales of real estate declined significantly compared to the prior fiscal year although floridas housing market reflects national trends it has proven more vulnerable to the realestate market downturn due to the popularity of second homes and speculative investment activity in recent years the overall trend for other sources of general fund revenues such as corporate income taxes and intangible taxes show either consistency with the prior fiscal year or decline despite the pressure on general fund revenues the state was able to slightly improve its cash reserves during the year a special legislative session was held in october  to address anticipated revenue shortfalls predicted by revenue estimates prepared in august  the resulting action chapter  laws of florida permanently reduced floridas budget by over  billion for the fiscal year ending june   the most recent revenue estimate prepared in november  reduces estimated general fund revenue collections by an additional  billion for the fiscal ending june   the november estimate is lower than fiscal

general revenue tax collections the state was able to increase the fund balance of the budget stabilization fund by  percent to  billion for the fiscal year ended june   the budget stabilization fund is reserved for use to offset general fund deficits and other purposes maintenance of this reserve is an indication of fiscal strength florida continues to follow conservative fiscal management practices as evidenced by the quick response to reduce spending for the fiscal year ending june   financial trends these trends help assess how floridas financial position has changed over time for fiscal year  ended june   the net assets invested in governmental activities increased  percent as compared to  percent in fiscal year  the net assets invested in businesstype activities increased  percent as compared to a  percent decrease in fiscal year  this significant increase follows a decrease that was primarily a result of reimbursements for losses associated with four hurricanes in  the net assets invested in the total primary government which includes governmental activities and businesstype activities increased  percent in fiscal year  as compared to  percent in fiscal year  revenues and expenditures this information relates to floridas significant revenue sources and can assist with evaluating the governments ability to produce its own source revenues governmental funds include general special revenue capital projects and debt service funds revenues are recognized when they are both measurable and available to finance current expenditures floridas revenues totaled approximately  billion while the expenses totaled approximately  billion the total governmental fund balance was approximately  billion the net expense is the difference between the program revenues and expenses it indicates the degree to which a function or program is supported with its own fees and programspecific grants and its reliance upon funding from general revenues the total primary government net expense for fiscal year  was  billion as compared to  billion resulting in a decrease in the expense of  debt management this information will provide an understanding of floridas outstanding debt and its ability to issue new debt floridas constitution and statutes require that florida not run a deficit in its budget as a whole or in any separate fund within its budget rather its budget and funds must be kept in balance from currently available revenues each fiscal year if the governor of florida or the comptroller of florida believes a deficit will occur in any fund by statute he must certify his opinion to floridas administrative commission which then is authorized to reduce all florida agency budgets and releases by a sufficient amount to prevent a deficit in any fund additionally the florida constitution prohibits florida from borrowing by issuing bonds to fund its operations section  of article vii of the florida constitution authorizes florida to issue general obligation bonds and revenues bonds to finance or refinance the cost of state fixed capital outlay projects authorized by law general obligation bonds are secured by the full faith and credit of florida and payable from the proceeds of various taxes revenue bonds are payable from funds that receive legally restricted revenues the florida division of bond finance of the florida state board of administration has the responsibility to issue all state bonds floridas outstanding general obligation bonds at june   totaled approximately  billion and were issued to finance such capital outlays as educational projects of local school districts community colleges and state universities environmental protection and highway construction during the fiscal year ended june   the state took advantage of favorable conditions and issued bonds for the purpose of refunding previously issued bonds the refundings of these bond series were made in order to obtain lower interest rates and the resulting savings in debt service payments over the life of the bonds also the legal debt margin calculated for fiscal year  is  million as compared to  million fiscal year  declining revenue collections recently resulted in a key debt ratio of the state moving near a target limit set by the legislature as a component of conservative fiscal policies as long as revenue collections available to pay debt service remain lower than anticipated the state does not have additional bonding capacity beyond already authorized programs while staying below this target any longterm borrowings not already authorized must be evaluated with a higher threshold for justification considering the importance of maintaining floridas excellent bond ratings which serve to keep the cost of borrowing low litigation currently under litigation are several issues relating to state actions or state taxes that put at risk a portion of general revenue fund monies there is no assurance whether any such matters individually or in the aggregate will have a materially adverse effect on floridas financial position the future challenges lay ahead as compromises are made to reduce state spending in light of declining general revenues the florida legislature has already reduced planned spending by over  billion for the fiscal year ending june   now it appears that additional spending reductions are needed as revenue collections continue to be below projections ratings as of july  all outstanding general obligation bonds of the state of florida are rated aaa by sp and aa by moodys any explanation

risk factors economic condition and outlook kentuckys economy has shown strong gains for the last three years but in terms of both personal income and employment these gains have been less than the national average kentuckys substantial reliance on manufacturing jobs is the primary cause for the lower growth excess manufacturing capacity abroad and increased productivitywithout a concomitant increase in wageshas kept income from growing in fiscal year  personal income is estimated to have increased by  percent to  billion wages and salaries comprise about  percent of total income these were up by  percent during the year kentuckys personal income is expected to be up by  percent in fiscal year  and then grow at lower rates of  and  percent in fiscal year  and fiscal year  the lower growth rates are tied to the general economic slowdown related to the subprime lending crisis and the spike in energy prices nonfarm employment in kentucky increased by  percent in fiscal year  resulting in the addition of  jobs during fiscal year  the job market weakened substantially with employment increasing by  percent and the creation of just  jobs the serviceproviding sectors posted

construction the goodsproducing sector accounts for  percent of all jobs in kentucky compared to the national average of  percent in the last few years this has been to kentuckys disadvantage as manufacturing facilities have moved to lowcost centers abroad and the ones that remain have seen a surge in productivity the subprime meltdown has had some impact on kentucky but not at the same scale as states like california or florida however kentucky will feel the impact of a prolonged financial crisis at the national level for the next three years overall employment growth is expected to average  percent annually the sliding dollar is expected to help kentuckys exports but the wage differential between newly industrialized economies and the us is difficult to bridge this means

predicted that louisiana should be within  jobs of its prestorm employment level at the end of  and should surpass prestorm employment sometime in  the states efforts to close the gap will depend on a number of factors beyond the control of policy makers in the state therefore the state will base them on the following expectations in   the national economy will avoid a recession and the real gross domestic product rgdp growth rate will rise approximately   interest rates will stabilize with the year fixed mortgage rate rising only one half percentage point  the pressures on natural gas prices are taking a more downward approach and  demographic changes in louisianas population will create an intensifying labor market shortage over the rest of the decade driving up wage rates incentivizing older workers to stay in the workforce and encouraging both more outsourcing and immigration the problem will be especially intense in the states construction industry due to a remarkable number of large construction projects planned over  the oil and gas industry is expected to continue to be an exceptional extraction sector with oil prices varying from  to  a barrel for  though recent prices

increase if these forecasts hold up louisiana will begin to set new employment records sometime in  fund highlights the major governmental funds are the general fund bond security and redemption fund and louisiana education quality trust fund the general fund is the chief operating fund of the state the bond security and redemption fund receives all money deposited into the state treasury except federal funds donations or other forms of assistance when otherwise required and out of this fund all obligations secured by the full faith and credit of the state which are due and payable in the current fiscal year are paid the louisiana education quality trust fund uses funds received from the federal government from mineral production or leases on the outer continental shelf for various purposes aimed at improving the quality of education in louisiana the overall performance of the general fund increased by  million and the unreservedundesignated fund balance increased by  million to a balance of  billion  most of the increase in revenues of  billion  resulted from the increased funding made available to the state as community development block grant disaster funds for the road home program in addition the recovery and rebuilding effort steadily fueled sustained economic activity throughout fiscal year  resulting in gains in individual and corporate income and general sales taxes higher than expected oil prices led to increases in severance taxes royalties and mineral bonuses the increase in insurance premiums following the  hurricanes resulted in higher insurance premium tax collections from the prior year general fund expenditures have increased by  billion  the major portion of this increase can be attributed to expenditures relating to the road home program the bond security and redemption fund revenues increased by  billion  in fiscal year  mainly because of an increase in tax revenue the louisiana education quality trust fund reported interest earnings of  million a  increase and market gains of  million assets the overall financial position for the state improved from the previous year as reflected in the increase in net assets to  billion  net assets for governmental activities increased by  billion  while net assets for businesstype activities increased by  million  the largest portion of the net assets of the state  billion  reflects investment in capital assets eg land roads buildings machinery and equipment these assets are used to provide services to residents of the state and consequently are not available for future spending capital assets increased by  billion  due mainly to infrastructure improvements under the louisiana transportation infrastructure model for economic development timed program in contrast current and other assets eg cash investments receivables and inventory totaled  billion  of total assets at fiscal year end and the state uses these resources to repay debt associated with capital assets the current and other assets of the state at june   represent an increase of  from the prior fiscal year cash has increased by  billion  in part due to an increase in cash in the capital outlay escrow fund of  billion which reflects the proceeds of a  million bond sale during fiscal year  the coastal protection and restoration fund previously the wetlands conservation and restoration fund with a cash balance of  million received additional funding during fiscal year  in part from the proceeds of the tobacco settlement securitization to further the development and implementation of a program to protect and restore louisianas coastal area which was severely damaged by the  hurricanes the  overcollections fund with a cash balance of  million received  million from the fema reimbursement fund for state fema match funds which was forgiven by the us congress in addition the state has created the louisiana megaproject development fund with a cash balance of  million to provide for economic development megaprojects for the state restricted net assets represent those assets not available for spending as a result of legislative or constitutional requirements donor agreements or grant requirements restricted net assets decreased by  billion  from the previous fiscal year for governmental activities reflecting in part a decrease in the restricted for other purposes component of net assets of  billion this decrease reflects the guidance found in gasb statement no  net assets restricted by enabling legislation which clarifies which assets should be restricted by enabling legislation enabling legislation authorizes a government to assess levy charge or otherwise mandate payment of resources from external resource providers and includes a legally enforceable requirement that those resources be used only for the specific purposes stipulated in the legislation although gasb statement  was implemented last year additional research was performed and a more restrictive set of criteria now has to be met for an asset to be considered restricted by enabling legislation as a result of the research the state has classified net assets as unrestricted that previously were determined to be restricted the decrease in restricted net assets was offset by an increase in restricted for capital projects of  billion reflecting increased funding in the capital outlay fund for the states highway program restricted net assets increased by  million  for businesstype activities caused by an increase in the unemployment trust fund restricted for unemployment compensation over last year balances are higher this year as a result of a decrease in the number of unemployment claims compared to last year and an increase in the tax rates on employers to build up the unemployment trust fund after depletion caused by the large increase in unemployment claims following hurricanes katrina and rita for fiscal year  unrestricted net assets increased by  billion  from  for governmental activities a significant portion of this increase is due to an increase in capital grants and contributions revenue of  billion reflecting the large influx of federal community development block grant cdbg funds for the road home program in addition income tax revenue increased by  billion reflecting higher wages in response to labor shortages after the hurricanes unrestricted net assets increased by  million  for businesstype activities reflecting an unrestricted balance of  million in the louisiana gulf opportunity zone loan fund this fund was created to provide debt service assistance under the federal gulf opportunity zone act of  for local government entities which suffered catastrophic losses of tax and other revenues after hurricanes katrina and rita cash management the state treasurer is responsible for managing all cash and investments with the exception of certain component units included in the reporting entity that have independent powers to manage and invest their funds during fiscal year  cash management and investment transactions managed by the state treasurer included checking accounts certificates of deposit us government and agency obligations commercial paper repurchase agreements and security lending agreements for fiscal year  the treasury earned  on its fixedincome investments for the general fund the investments

higher education both public and private industries vacation areas and world famous retailers keeping the economy relatively stable and an incubator for new ideas and growth unemployment has remained close to the national average due to these stabilization factors the state of maine with an international reputation for recreational cultural historical and educational institutions remains a significant spoke of the new england economy maines economy remains diversified inflation continued to rise though the past year the consumer price index rose by  percent from july  to july  however fuel and utilities prices rose much faster the rise in oil prices to over  a barrel in late fall has put pressure on both household and government budgets sustained oil prices in excess of  per barrel will impose significant challenges to both households and governments during the winter heating season personal income continues to rise in maine faster than inflation according to the latest statistics available personal income is estimated to have risen by  percent in calendar year  the moderate growth in  and  is in contrast to the much slower growth in  when the state was affected by a number of events the most significant of which was the base realignment and closure commission brac process unemployment has hovered around the national average throughout the year the rate in maine stood at  percent in september of  which is slightly above the national rate of  percent major initiatives the first regular session of the rd legislature as a part of public law  chapter  enacted the governors initiative making sweeping reform in the administrative structure of local school districts the legislation will have long lasting effects on the delivery of administrative service to schools the reform known as school consolidation proposed to reduce the number of local school districts from  to no more than  districts the consolidation of school administrative districts is the most far reaching and significant legislation proposed or enacted since the sinclair act of  that created the school administrative district system also enacted in public law  chapter  was the establishment of an irrevocable trust to account for and invest funds set aside to amortize the unfunded liabilities of the state employee teachers and county and municipal firefighters and law enforcement personnel participating in the plan the initial deposit to the trust is expected to amount to  million budgetary highlights for the  fiscal year the final legally adopted budgeted expenditures for the general fund amounted to  billion an increase of about  million from the original legally adopted budget of approximately  billion actual expenditures on a budgetary basis amounted to approximately  million less than those authorized in the final budget however after deducting the encumbered obligations and other commitments that will come due in fiscal year   million of unobligated funds remained as a result of a continuing concerted effort to control spending primarily in the broad categories of education and social services actual revenues exceeded final budget forecasts by  million as a part of the final budget adjustment for fiscal year  the legislature approved a direct appropriation to the states budget stabilization fund in the amount of  million the additional appropriation increased the balance in the fund to  million as of june   this item is further explained in note  of notes to the financial statements debt management the constitution of the state of maine provides that the legislature shall not create any debt which exceeds  except to suppress insurrection to repel invasion or for purposes of war except when twothirds of the legislature and a majority of the voters authorize the issuance of debt the constitution also provides that tax anticipation loans must be repaid during the fiscal year of issuance constitutional amendments have been adopted which also allow the legislature to authorize the issuance of bonds to insure payments on revenue bonds of up to  for local public school building projects in the amount of up to  to guarantee student loans to insure payments on up to  of mortgage loans for indian housing to insure payments on up to  of mortgage loans or small business loans to war veterans and to insure payments on up to  of mortgage loans for industrial manufacturing fishing agricultural and recreational enterprises this last authorization has been limited statutorily to a maximum of  available for issue through the finance authority of maine when issuing general obligation bonds the state of maine pledges its full faith and credit to repay the financial obligation unless certain tax revenue streams are specifically restricted states typically pledge all of their taxraising powers to secure the obligations the major bond rating agencies regularly assess the capacity and willingness of the state to repay its general obligation debt moodys sp and fitch make their assessments in large part by examining four basic analytical areas economy financial performance and flexibility debt burden and administration the economic base is the most critical element in determining the rating growth and diversity in the demographics tax base and employment base of the state over the last decade are indicators of future growth prospects and debt repayment capabilities generally states with higher income levels and diverse economic bases have superior debt repayment capabilities and are better protected from sudden shocks or unexpected volatility in the economy because a strong economy does not always ensure a states ability to meet debt payments the states financial management and performance are also key factors financial analysis involves several factors including accounting and reporting methods revenue and expenditure patterns annual operating and budgetary performance leverage and equity positions budget and financial planning and contingency obligations these factors present a clear indication of the financial strengths and weaknesses of the state the rating agencies analyses of these factors provide the framework for judging maines capacity to manage economic political and financial uncertainties at yearend the state had  million in general obligation

independent verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information it is based in part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in maine or contained in official statements for various maine municipal obligations maryland risk factors state government marylands employment is based largely in services trade and government these sectors along with finance insurance and real estate are the largest contributors to the gross state product the maryland constitution requires the governor to submit to the general assembly a balanced budget for the following year the general assembly cannot increase the budget except in certain organizational units the budget currently uses a legally mandated budgetary fund structure each state agency is provided appropriations at a program level which is the level at which expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriations the state also utilizes an encumbrance system to serve as a tool for managing available appropriations maryland maintains its accounts to conform with the legally mandated budget and also to comply with generally accepted accounting principles financial control is generally exercised under the budgetary system there is a spending affordability committee which consists of certain designated officers of the general assembly and other members as may be appointed by the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of delegates each year the committee must submit a report to the general assemblys legislative policy committee and to the governor recommending the level of state spending the level of new debt authorization the level of state personnel and the use of any anticipated surplus funds also the general assembly created a capital debt affordability committee the members of which are the treasurer the comptroller the secretary of budget and management the secretary of transportation and one person appointed by the governor this committee is required to submit to the governor by september  of each year an estimate of the maximum amount of new general obligation debt that prudently may be authorized the committees recent reports encompass all tax supported debt including in addition to general obligation debt bonds issued by the department of transportation bonds issued by the maryland stadium authority and capital lease transactions although the committees responsibilities are advisory only the governor is required to give due consideration to the committees finding in preparing a preliminary allocation of new general obligation debt authorizations for the next ensuing fiscal year economy and outlook all of the uncertainties and drags at the national levelenergy prices credit concerns financial market volatility declining consumer confidence and especially the troubled housing marketare affecting the states economy but the economy has to date absorbed all of the bad news and expectations of future bad news and continued to expand the key question at this point is whether future expectations regarding the housing market are accurate it appears that most economists have chased the bad news adjusting forecasts downward with every new release of data direct and indirect effects of the housing market downturn and the impact of resets of adjustable rate mortgages which had been expected for some time and have been unfolding since late  have now had a measurable impact on the states economy and are likely to pose an increasingly formidable challenge to economic growth through the end of next year and perhaps beyond at present fallout from the housing market seems likely to hold back the states economy through  directly or indirectly affecting virtually every industry the possibility exists that these issues will develop to such an extent that the national or state economies slip into recession the housing market in maryland has deteriorated rapidly in recent monthssales of existing homes in september were down  from september  and are now nearly  below  levels september was the third lowest sales month since january  for the first time on record sales in september were lower than sales the prior january and february which does not bode well for the near term the median sales price of existing homes sold dropped  from june to september more than twice the seasonal decline experienced in any other year this decade as a result of a sharp decline in sales and apparently falling prices the active inventory of existing homes for sale has increased nearly  units over the course of this year to just over  a record high the first effects of the deteriorating housing market on the broader economy have shown themselves in the construction industry employment in residential construction dropped noticeably in the first quarter of  the latest detailed data available employment at singlefamily housing contractors was down  while multifamily contractors experienced an  contraction both dropping at faster rates than the fourth quarter when they fell  and  altogether residential construction jobs dropped  in the first quarter after falling  in the fourth quarter of  developments in the housing market since then give no hope for recovery in the near future some of the jobs lost on the residential side may shift to the nonresidential side of the construction industry the high demand in maryland for school construction facilities at community colleges and public institutions of higher education new roads and maintenance of existing transportation facilities will not be satisfied in the near future and thus at least half of the nonresidential construction sector has at worst a very stable outlook with the states capital debt affordability committee recommending a  increase for the fiscal year  capital program and the recent court decision allowing construction of the intercounty connector the outlook for public construction could be one of accelerating growth absorbing some of the downturn in the residential sector likewise the outlook for commercial construction is moderately positive rents for commercial property in bethesda are currently  of those in the district of columbia and  of those in northern virginia providing an attractive alternative the base realignment and closure commission brac activity which may also absorb some of the excess residential capacity will help to support commercial rents and construction in the baltimore region the financial services industry will also be directly affected by the housing slowdown two mortgage brokerages have already reported layoffs totaling  employees and more are likely to follow in addition resets of adjustable rate mortgages are expected to continue at very high levels through the end of  these factors along with volatility in the stock markets the loss of spending power from those in the construction and finance industries who have lost their jobs and high and once again rising energy prices which have diverted up to  of personal income from other spending over the past two years may keep consumer spending from strengthening appreciably in the near term the only significant counterbalances are low interest rates and a relatively tight labor market in maryland weak consumer spendingas demonstrated by growth in state sales tax collections of just  in fiscal year translates into low profit growth and flat employment for the trade industry particularly retail trade car sales have been flat for more than two years and may have recently resumed the longerterm downward trend weak consumer spending will also affect the leisure and hospitality services sector although the weak dollar may help to cushion the blow by encouraging international tourism passenger traffic at bwi thurgood marshall airport surpassed preseptember  levels in  due partly to the continuing expansion of southwest and airtran airlines government which has acted as a stabilizing factor for the states economy for some time will also be affected by the housing market through the effect on tax revenues at the federal level individual income tax revenues from capital gains on both owner occupied and nonowner occupied residential property will decline that factor will also affect state income tax revenues state revenues will also be affected through the estate tax sales tax and certain courtrelated revenues while local governments will largely be affected through recordation and transfer taxes property tax growth will be largely unaffected due to the homestead property tax credits which cap growth in the taxable assessment at  or less annually for owneroccupied property given the enormous runup in prices it will be quite some time before taxable assessments reach market values even if prices fall  these fiscal pressures may cause a belttightening at the state and local levels although the outcome of the special session of the general assembly may provide the state in particular more flexibility federal employment in the state will have declined five consecutive years by the end of  but the federal fiscal situation has improved in recent years federal spending in the state on science and technology dropped in the second half of  but spending on defense and homeland security continues at high levels maryland received less than  of total federal procurement spending in  a share that has grown by over a full percentage point since then brac aside government may not be an engine of growth over the next several years but it should continue to be a large stabilizing presence for the states economy another stabilizing sector over the near term and one that will provide some growth is the health and education services industry federal spending does support this sector with a disproportionately large  of federal health spending coming to the state over  of that funding is focused in baltimore more broadly maryland receives the third highest amount of science and engineering funding from the federal government over threequarters of which is health and education related behind only california and new york the health researchservices infrastructure which has built up around baltimore city and the washington suburbs will continue to have additional resources funneled to it risks to the forecast are clearly on the downside the largest negative risk particularly in maryland is the development of a selfreinforcing downward cycle in the housing market there is a possibility that as the economy slows and arms continue to reset foreclosures will increase as the supply of homes expands further downward pressure will be exerted on prices in turn more potential buyers will delay purchases while at the same time it becomes more difficult for those facing resets to refinance before the higher payments often  higher come due further expanding the supply the impact of such a vicious cycle on the broader economy would be substantial even more so if mortgagerelated risks are currently mispriced in the stock and bond markets longerterm risks for the states economy include slowing population growth current census estimates show decelerating growth each year since  in maryland with  growth of under  the weakest since  this trend may be reversed over the next several years due to brac

whole this lag continued into fiscal year  the commonwealths rate was above the national rate by  to  during the fall of  in april  massachusetts was less than the country but only by  as of october of  the commonwealths rate was   less than it was a year earlier the commonwealth continues to contain a large employment base of education health and human services positions that stabilize the economy per capita net income remains at least  ahead of the national average however concerns are long held in the commonwealth about housing affordability costs the comptroller general of the united states david walker has elevated the discussion of fiscal sustainability to a national debate the federal government the states and local governments all will face sustainability issues in the future walker paints an ominous picture showing that federal discretionary spending  where the commonwealth receives its federal revenues  has dropped from  in  to  of the federal budget in  the  includes the costs of defense the costs of social insurance programs and the net interest charges of the federal government will constrain state and local levels in the future to the point where the fiscal burden of these programs according to walker is  per person the commonwealth reported in october that on a statutory basis it spent more than it received in its budget of approximately  million in fiscal year  similarly the fiscal year  budget relies on one time funding and is currently projected to end the year with an operating loss of  million the commonwealth like most governments relies heavily on federal revenues finding either new streams of revenue or ways to streamline spending in the future is the only way to start to prepare for the downturn in federal revenues that is surely coming in the future massachusetts continues to recover economically from the recession that ended in fiscal year  the commonwealth is home to many world renowned institutions of higher education both public and private keeping the economy relatively stable and an incubator for new ideas and growth unemployment has dropped due to this stabilization the commonwealth with an international reputation for medical cultural historical and educational institutions remains the economic and educational hub of new england the commonwealths economy remains diversified but its strongest component is its knowledge  based technology and service industries the commonwealth is home to  sp  companies among them six fortune  headquarters massachusetts infrastructure provides strong support for this knowledgebased economy there are over  colleges and universities located in massachusetts and the  us census updated in march of  estimated that  of the residents over age  have earned bachelors degrees compared to an estimate of  for the united states as a whole in the same survey nearly  of residents over age  at least have a high school diploma in primary education the national assessment of education progress ranks massachusetts first in th and th grade mathematics and reading second in writing and fourth and sixth in science in grades  and  respectively this shows that massachusetts school children are consistently among the best educated in the nation per capita net income actually dropped  in fiscal year  lagging behind the  drop nationally for the commonwealth this is the first drop since fiscal year  a drop of  which was entirely due to the events of september   this is a caution sign nationwide on a dollar basis per capita net income is over  higher than the national average unemployment during the year declined overall beginning the year at  and ending slightly lower as of june at  during most of the year the federal rate was slightly lower but recently the commonwealths rate improved to  and dropped below the national rate once again net assets the liabilities of the commonwealth exceeded its assets at the end of fiscal year  by over  billion an improvement of over  billion during the fiscal year of the  billion deficit amount unrestricted net assets is reported as a negative  billion offset by  billion in restricted net assets there are two primary reasons for negative unrestricted net assets upon completion the central artery  third harbor tunnel cat will be owned by the massachusetts turnpike authority and the massachusetts port authority the commonwealth however is paying for the construction of these assets and retains a large amount of related debt similarly the commonwealth has a liability of  billion for its share of the construction costs of schools owned and operated by municipalities through the massachusetts school building authority msba msba will begin approving grants in fiscal year  because of the statutory prohibition of the msba from accepting applications for new school construction until july   this overall liability of  billion decreased by  billion during fiscal year  due to grant payments made to municipalities during the year and reductions of grant payment obligations due to audits done by msba during the fiscal year significant restricted net asset balances were set aside for unemployment benefits and debt retirement changes in net assets the commonwealths net assets increased by nearly  billion in fiscal year  net assets of governmental activities increased by about half of this  billion the increase in net assets is primarily attributable to the aforementioned school construction activity and increased tax revenues tax revenues rose by nearly  billion above prior year collections expenses of governmental activities were nearly  billion this increase from fiscal year s  billion is attributable to increase in local aid expenses of  million and medicaid expenses of over  million however major categories of expenses rose led by medicaid costs general revenue for the commonwealth net of transfers but including taxes investment income and tobacco settlement income from governmental activities was nearly  billion net assets of the businesstype activities showed an increase of nearly  million governmental fund balances at june   the commonwealths governmental funds reported a combined ending fund balance of over  billion of the  billion over  billion represents unreserved or undesignated fund balance this is primarily due to an increase in the school building authoritys balance of over  million less a  million decrease in the general fund balance and an increase deficit in the highway fund the highway fund maintains a cumulative deficit of nearly  billion the highway funds deficit increased by  million from the prior year the unreserved and undesignated fund balance of over  billion includes the highway fund deficit similar to last year  million has been declared as a receivable in the governmental funds related to anticipated tobacco settlement proceeds in fiscal year  as previously mentioned the lottery had an operating deficit of

nearly  billion for grant payments to municipalities another  million was transferred to the msba from the commonwealth from sales taxes governmental reserved fund balances total over  billion the vast majority of this is nearly  million reserved for retirement of indebtedness the vast majority of which is held in escrows related to refunding bonds and to pay grant anticipation notes of the remaining portion  million is reserved for the cat owner controlled insurance program for workers compensation and general liability and  million is reserved for amounts due from cities and towns debt

given weak manufacturing employment performance declining vehicle production continued declines in big  market share and continued supply rationalization among vehicle suppliers michigans employment performance has been below the national average substantial productivity gains in the manufacturing sector and vehicle industry have also contributed to michigans below average employment performance

wages and salaries income fell an estimated  percent in  both personal income and wages and salaries failed to keep pace with the increase in consumer prices as measured by the detroit consumer price index  percent several factors are weighing on the national economy including sharp declines in the housing market worsening credit markets and near record inflationadjusted oil prices as a result the us economic growth will remain tepid given this michigan employment is expected to decline in   although less so than in  with  employment falling by  percent in  michigan personal income is projected

will not adversely affect the market value or marketability of the bonds or the ability of the respective obligors to pay interest on or principal of the bonds particularly in view of the dependency of local governments and other authorities upon state aid and reimbursement programs and in the case of bonds issued by the state building authority the dependency of the state building authority on the receipt of rental payments from the state to meet debt service requirements upon such bonds in the  fiscal year the state deferred certain scheduled cash payments to municipalities school districts universities and community colleges while such deferrals were made up at specified later dates similar future deferrals could have an adverse impact on the cash position of some local

constitutional statutory and charter tax rate limitations in addition several major industrial corporations have instituted challenges of their ad valorem property tax assessments in a number of local municipal units in the state if successful such challenges could have an adverse impact on the ad valorem tax bases of such units which could adversely affect their ability to raise funds for operation and debt service requirements assets the states combined net assets decreased  million  percent over the course of this fiscal years operations the net assets of the governmental activities decreased  million  percent and businesstype activities had a decrease of  million  percent the largest component of the states net assets  billion reflects its investment in capital assets eg land

period is  billion currently the missouri department of transportation modot receives funding from state vehicle sales taxes fuel taxes and federal sources however the us department of transportation has advised states that by october  the national highway trust fund will have a deficit balance this could decrease the federal money received by the state by onethird higher fuel prices are another likely cause in the decrease in available funds a trend has shown that motorists are driving less and purchasing more economical vehicles due to higher fuel prices which means lower revenue from fuel

be refunded based on the liability reported on state income tax returns if the excess revenue collected is less than  of the revenue limit the excess revenue shall be transferred to the general revenue fund the revenue limit can be exceeded by a constitutional amendment adopted by the people or if the general assembly approves by a twothirds vote an emergency declaration by the governor the

year  total revenue collections decreased by  million or  during fiscal year  while total expenses only increased by  million the decrease in revenue was due primarily to decreases in several types of

sources that are generally available to investors and are believed to be accurate no independent verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information it is based in part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in missouri or contained in official statements for various missouri municipal obligations nebraska risk factors general since nebraskas constitution generally allows no indebtedness government expenses of such departments and agencies must be met on a payasyougo basis the state provides a full range of services including the construction and maintenance of highways and infrastructure education social and health services public safety conservation of natural resources economic development and recreation facilities and development budgetary control of state expenditures is maintained chiefly by three processes first a budget is required to be adopted through passage of appropriation bills by the legislature second the appropriated funds are allocated by program and fund type and are controlled by the executive branch through an allotment process the legislature may also enact a supplemental appropriation bill and other appropriation bills as it deems necessary finally the states accounting system is designed to budget check each expenditure to ensure the appropriation is not exceeded economic outlook the general fund operations of the state are almost entirely dependent upon the income and sales taxes the state receives each year such taxes represent over  percent of all general fund revenues net revenue from income taxes and sales taxes from all funds for the fiscal year ended june   increased  million over the prior year due to the steady growth in nebraska in all areas jobs income and revenue in finalizing the biennium budget for the fiscal years ending june   and june   the legislature as required by the state constitution balanced the budget for the fiscal year ending june   the states general fund ended the fiscal year with a cash and investments balance that exceeded one billion dollars for the first time ever at  billion the current forecast for fiscal year  anticipates net receipts in the general fund to increase about  million or approximately a  increase over fiscal year  no significant changes in revenue are anticipated in the other funds state economy the bureau of business research of the university of nebraskalincoln and the nebraska business forecast council remain optimistic on nebraskas economic future and have published the following comments about its economy aggregate farm income is expected to grow rapidly in the next two years solid broadbased employment growth rising proprietor incomes and strong growth in dividend and interest incomes will lead to strong overall growth in nonfarm personal income while housing construction will not fully recover until  or  other components of the construction industry such as hospital health care hotel and restaurant construction activity should grow steadily nebraska should also continue to benefit from further decentralization of manufacturing activity away from the industrial midwest to areas in nebraska opportunities continue to improve in the food processing sector and the transportation and warehousing industries are expected to continue to expand rapidly finally strong growth is expected in services employment in areas such as health care and social assistance cash management all cash is required to be deposited in the state treasury at the direction of the state treasurer the state investment officer invests all cash in the operating investment pool oip this pool is comprised of some shortterm investments and many mediumterm investments the oip is reflected as cash and investments on the states financial statements interest earnings are credited on a monthly basis to each fund eligible to earn interest all interest earnings not credited to other funds are deposited in the general fund state law requires that all public funds deposited in banks be secured by having each such bank maintaining at all times an aggregate amount of securities of at least  percent of the amount on deposit less the  insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic it is the states policy to continually monitor the clearing and depository banks for compliance with this law longterm financial planning the state always is looking at least four years out in its analysis of the status of the financial condition of the state in preparing the its budgets with a working model of the biennium budget for fiscal years  and  in its analysis the state forecasting models to forecast revenue and then examine major expenditures especially those that have a trend of outpacing revenues future revenues are projected to increase between  and  percent annually this increase is quickly tempered by the fact that during the last legislative session the legislature passed the largest tax relief package in the history of the state this moderate growth of income will not be enough to counter the future estimates of school aid increasing  medicaid increasing  and public assistance increasing  since these expenditures comprise about half of the general fund expenditures this puts significant pressure in keeping all other costs of running the state to a minimum increase mode in order to provide a mandated balanced budget to ensure a balanced budget the state exerts considerable time and effort in reviewing the trends of future revenues and expenditures risk management workers compensation employee health coverage employee liability and general liability are selfinsured commercial insurance coverage has been purchased for automobile liability real and personal property damage employee life coverage and employees errors or omissions retirement systems total net assets of the states pension trust funds reached  billion by june   compared to  billion on june   these are the assets of the three defined benefit plans school judges and state patrol plans two defined contribution and cash balance plans county and state employees plans and the state employees deferred compensation plan that are administered by the state financial highlights  governmentwide the assets of the state exceeded its liabilities at june   by  billion the majority of the net assets are represented by the investment in the states infrastructure and other capital assets which cannot be used to fund ongoing activities of the state of the net assets unrestricted net assets were reported as  million most of which is available to be used to fund future needs of the state the primary governments net revenues exceeded net expenses for  by  million resulting in the increase in net assets the increase in net assets was primarily a result of a  million increase in investment earnings and a steady economy providing a moderate increase in taxes collected coupled with a less than budgeted increase of expenditures from  fund level general fund receipts for  were  million above the original budgeted amount and above the final budget by  million expenditures were  million less than the original budget on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis the general fund had  million in excess revenues prior to  million in other financing uses resulting in an ending fund balance on june   of  million other governmental funds receipts exceeded expenditures by  million in addition such funds received  million in other financing sources namely net transfers in increasing such fund balances at june   to  million the  million of net assets of the unemployment insurance fund represents eightynine percent of the proprietary funds such fund had a  million increase in net assets for  compared to a  million increase in  a  million smaller increase this was chiefly due to a  million decrease in business assessment fees collected from employers due to a lower rate being charged offset by an  million decrease in unemployment claims and a  million increase in investment income longterm liabilities longterm liabilities shown on the governmentwide financial statements totaled  million at june   which is a slight decrease from the prior year most of these liabilities consist of claims payable for workers compensation medical excess liability litigation unemployment insurance employee health insurance and medicaid in addition to the calculated amount for accrued vacation and vested sick leave due employees when they retire after a retired employee reaches the age of  the state has no further obligation for other post employment benefits net assets the states assets totaled  million at june   as compared to  million at june   as total liabilities only totaled  million net assets amounted to  million as of june   as of june   these amounts were  million and  million respectively by far the largest portion of the state of nebraskas net assets  percent reflects the states investment in capital assets eg land buildings equipment and infrastructure  highways bridges dams etc the state uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens thus these assets are not available for future spending restricted net assets are subject to external restrictions constitutional provisions or enabling legislation on how they can be used they also are not available for future spending for governmental activities other than capital assets the majority of the restricted net assets consist of the permanent school trust the tobacco settlement trust the intergovernmental trust and the loans to political subdivisions for drinking water and clean water projects the net assets for businesstype activities represents chiefly cash set aside for future unemployment insurance benefits over  of the states noncapital assets consist of cash and investments it should be noted that  million in  and  million in  of such assets represent securities lending collateral an amount created by a journal entry required by gasb in order to record a lending transaction since the asset is offset by a corresponding equal liability the net asset is zero and thus the asset cannot be spent receivables chiefly from taxes and the federal government represent  of the noncapital assets liabilities largely reflect three groupings which represent  of total state liabilities not including the obligations under securities lending explained in the above paragraph these are operational payables which consist of accounts payables and accrued liabilities of  million  million in  tax refunds payable of  million  million in  and longterm payables explained below since the states constitution generally prohibits the state from incurring debt the statement of net assets presents few longterm liabilities shown as noncurrent liabilities which total only  million  million in  the majority of such liabilities are for claims payable for workers compensation medical excess liability litigation unemployment insurance and employee health insurance totaling  million for   million for  medicaid claims for  million  million in  and the calculated amount for vested sick leave due employees when they retire and accrued vacation of  million in   million for  other minor amounts of longterm liabilities consist chiefly of capital lease obligations and bonds payable related to netc leasing corporation and nebraska state building corporation bonds both of these entities are legally separate from the state but are so intertwined with the state that they are in substance the same as the state such debt related to capital assets totaled  million at june   there was also  million of obligations under other financing arrangements the change in net assets of governmental activities other than an increase of  million in capital assets was due to the  million increase in unrestricted net assets and the  million increase in restricted net assets this was the result of increased taxes collected a significant jump in investment income and lower spending than expected at the end of june   the state is able to report positive balances in all of the three categories of net assets governmental activities governmental activities increased the states net assets by  million in   million in  furthermore governmental activities represent  of all the primary governments revenues program revenues of governmental activities were  million and were used to partially offset program expenses of  million leaving net expenses of  million only  of total expenses were spent on general government expenses general taxes investment earnings contributions to the permanent fund principal and transfers all totaling  million were used to more than cover the remaining costs of the governmental activities programs program revenues only increased  from  tax revenues were up  million which was a little short of offsetting the increase in program expenditures net of revenues however investment earnings increased  million as opposed to a  million decrease in  this increase in investment earnings was the result of more funds being invested at higher interest rates and large positive market value increases these two revenue items were the chief reasons net assets increased  million more than in  program expenditures net of revenue increased by  million in  businesstype activities the businesstype activities increased the states net assets by  million for  which was net of a  million transfer to the governmental activities most of the  million of businesstype activities program revenues was related to the business assessment fees in the unemployment insurance fund and lottery fund revenues the unemployment insurance fund had operating income of  million in  this income when combined with the  million in investment income produced  million of net revenue lottery revenues of  million generated net revenue of  million which was offset by the  million transfer to the governmental activities the lottery transfer was used primarily for education and environmental studies governmental funds the focus of the states governmental funds is to provide information on nearterm inflows and outflows and the availability of spendable resources in particular the unreserved balance may provide some indication of the states net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year unreserved balances may be designated or undesignated if unreserved balances are designated they are unreserved only within the confines of the purposes of the fund involved in the governmental funds most of the unreserved balances reside in designated funds at june   the states governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of  million the total unreserved balances amounted to  million general fund the general fund is the chief operating fund of the state the major general fund liability is the estimated tax refunds payable of  million such refunds payable are  million less than the expected taxes owed the state other assets of the general fund available to pay non taxrefund liabilities exceed such liabilities by  million on june   the general fund had a positive fund balance of  million while both revenues and expenditures increased in  revenues again exceeded expenditures which increased the fund balance  million in  which was about equal to the  million increase that occurred in  this operating increase in  when coupled with the  million of net transfers out caused the general fund balance to increase by  million ending with a fund balance of  million revenues in  were more than anticipated and were up  million over  chiefly due to  an increase in income tax revenue of  million a  increase over  and  increased investment income of  million due to more funds being invested at higher interest rates sales taxes from increased retail sales were up  over last year expenditures were less than budgeted due to continued efforts by agency heads to be conservative in spending to compensate for any downturns in revenues the state has maintained a budgetary basis cash reserve fund while this cash reserve fund is commingled with general fund cash in the general fund financial statements it is separate and distinct in that by state statute it can only be used  when the cash balance of the general fund is insufficient to meet general fund current obligations and  for legislatively mandated transfers to other funds any money transferred in accordance with item one above must be repaid as soon as there is sufficient cash in the general fund cash account to do so no such need existed in  the cash reserve fund was at  million at the beginning of  due to the fact that  revenues exceeded the forecast a statutory requirement caused a  million transfer from the general fund cash account to the cash reserve fund in fiscal year  in july  offsetting this large transfer was a  million payment made on august   from the cash reserve fund to settle a lawsuit against the state related to a lowlevel radioactive waste site there were also other transfers out of the fund of  million leaving a cash reserve fund balance at june   of  million the statutory transfer for excess receipts for fy  of  million was made in july  there were transfers out of the reserve of  million leaving a balance of  million at june   other governmental funds other governmental fund balances totaled  million at june    million of such fund balances is reserved to indicate that such dollars are not available for new spending because such funds  are represented by endowment principal  million  are represented by an asset that has not yet been received eg loans receivable  million  have been expended for other assets chiefly inventories  million and thus the funds are not available or  have been committed for debt service  million of the nongeneral fund unreserved fund balances of  million  million represents permanent school funds which can be used only for support of public schools  million is represented by special revenue funds which while unreserved normally must be spent within the confines of such special revenue funds a majority of these same funds are considered restricted on the governmentwide financial statements twentyeight million dollars is represented by other permanent funds which again normally must be spent within the confines of the fund fiftytwo million dollars is in the capital projects fund which while unreserved must be spent on a capital projects the three major funds presented as special revenue funds are the highway fund the federal fund and the health and social services fund with total fund balances of  million of this balance  million is classified as unreserved but which are restricted in the governmentwide statements indicating that the funds are unreserved only within the confines of such funds governmental funds other than the general fund saw an increase in fund balances of  million the fund balances of the following funds increased the highway fund  million the health and social service fund  million the permanent school fund  million and other nonmajor funds  million the federal fund decreased by  million fiduciary funds the pension trust funds represent the majority of the fiduciary funds such pension trust funds net assets increased  million to  million in  due primarily to a strong market in  which provided  million in appreciation of investments investment income in  was  million versus  million in  benefits refunds and related administrative expenses exceeded the contributions to the plans by only  million in another trust fund  million of participant contributions was received by the college savings plan and is recorded in the private purpose trust funds total net assets in the college savings plan now total  million proprietary funds the states proprietary funds provide the same type of information discussed earlier in the governmentwide financial statements under businesstype activities but in more detail the states one major proprietary fund the unemployment insurance fund had reported net assets of  million at the end of  this funds net assets increased  million in  mainly due to business assessment fees which exceeded the unemployment claims paid out by  million which in effect helped rebuild the cash reserves of the fund and investment earnings of  million other proprietary or enterprise funds the lottery fund the excess liability fund this fund was established to provide limited liability for physicians working in nebraska and cornhusker state industries this operation utilizes incarcerated persons to manufacture and sell items had combined income of  million prior to a  million transfer from the lottery to governmental funds such transfer was used primarily for education and environmental studies analysis of general fund in  the state continued to benefit from of an improved economy in the midwest forecasted revenues upon which the states budgeted general fund expenses were based were anticipated to be basically flat in  due to some changes in the sales tax base because the revenues continued to exceed expectations the states forecasting board made three new forecasts throughout the year each time increasing the expected revenues the total forecasted net revenues increased  million from the original revenue forecast of  million however the state even slightly exceeded the revised projected tax revenues of  million by  million realizing actual tax revenues net of refunds of  million on a budgetary basis additionally agencies continued to watch their general fund expenditures and ended up spending  million less than the final appropriated amount this reduction when coupled with the increased tax revenues allowed the state to finish  with  million of general fund revenues in excess of expenditures on a budgetary basis prior to net transfers out debt management article xiii of the state constitution prohibits the state from incurring debt in excess of one hundred thousand dollars however there is a provision in the constitution that permits the issuance of revenue bonds for  construction of highways and  construction of water conservation and

city face serious potential economic problems the city accounts for approximately  of the states population and personal income and the citys financial health affects the state in numerous ways statewide urban centers have experienced significant changes involving migration of the more affluent to the suburbs and an influx of generally less affluent residents regionally the older northeast cities have suffered because of the relative success that the south and the west have had in attracting people and business the city also has had to face greater competition as other major cities have developed financial and business capabilities which make them less dependent on the specialized services traditionally available almost exclusively in the city the financial condition of the state is affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions in particular interest rate risk and equity market volatility pose a particularly large degree of uncertainty for the state although the states division of the budget dob projects the current national recession to be mild there are a number of factors that pose a particularly large degree of risk for new york due to the uncertainty in the financial and capital markets the states tax revenues are more reliant on the financial sector of the economy than are other states and other regions of the nation the full extent of the losses associated with subprime debt remains unclear and escalating losses could result in a further delay in the recovery of wall street profits and bonuses if inflation rates accelerate the federal reserve may choose to reverse its current policy and increase rates which traditionally has had adverse effects on the state economy in addition should the states real estate market cool more rapidly than anticipated household consumption and taxable capital gains realizations could be negatively affected high energy prices also pose a particular risk to the states tourism sector other significant risks to the current economic forecast include i global political instability including the uncertain conflicts in afghanistan iraq and the middle east in general ii high oil prices which could adversely affect many different sectors of the national and state economies iii weakness of consumer spending or a failure of investment spending to commence growth during the year which could worsen recessionary conditions and iv the potential for future terrorist attacks on us soil economic condition and outlook following the states recovery from the recession of the early s it now appears that the state economy is entering a recession that is projected to be mild compared to the two past recessions the financial markets showed strong performance in the first half of  the subsequent national economic downturn has affected the state economy although the states downturn is likely to occur with a lag relative to the national economy tightening in the credit markets along with the volume of writedowns of bad debt related to subprime mortgagebacked assets are likely to continue to have a significant adverse affect on the states economy the states economy is heavily concentrated in the information finance and business service sectorsmore than half of the states economic output comes from these sectors as a result wage growth for the state is projected to increase at a lower rate than the projected national rate recent figures indicate that state unemployment rates are slightly better than national unemployment figures but projections for wage growth are higher at the national level in march  the unemployment rate in new york was  percent compared with the national rate of  percent the dob projects state wage growth to be  for  as compared to projections of wage growth of  for  at the national level the city has a highly diversified economic base with a substantial volume of business activity in the service wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing industries and is the location of many securities banking law accounting new media and advertising firms with a population of approximately  the city is an international center of business and culture and a leading tourist destination the city experienced an economic slowdown that began in  as a result of the september  attack a national economic recession and a downturn in the securities industry and came to an end in  since then wall street activity tourism and the real estate market have driven a broad based economic recovery up until the economic slowdown that began in the second half of calendar year  current and outyear fiscal projections the state governors executive budget for the  fiscal year projected ending the  fiscal year in balance on a cash basis with a closing balance in the general fund of  billion and projected gaps of  billion in fiscal year   billion in fiscal year  and  billion in fiscal year  the dob notes that the enacted budget similar to the governors executive budget also projects ending the  fiscal year in balance on a cash basis projecting a closing fund balance in the general fund of  billion and projected gaps of approximately  billion in fiscal year   billion in fiscal year  and  billion in fiscal year  supplemental information released on may   indicates that tentative collective bargaining agreements with  public employee unions will result in a general fund closing balance of  billion for fiscal year  and increased outyear budget gaps in the range of  to  million per year the citys current financial plan the financial plan projects budget balance in the  and  fiscal years in accordance with gaap as in effect through june   the citys financial plan projects gaps of  billion  billion and  billion in fiscal years  through  respectively since the previous financial plan the financial plan reflects an increase in projected net revenues of  billion in fiscal year  and decreases in projected net revenues of  million  billion and  billion in fiscal years  through  respectively general government results an operating surplus of  million was reported in the general fund for the fiscal year ended march   as a result the general fund had an accumulated fund balance of  billion the state completed its fiscal year ended march   with a combined governmental funds operating deficit of  million as compared to a combined governmental funds operating surplus in the preceding fiscal year of  billion the combined  operating deficit of  million is due in significant part to an  million deficit in the special revenue fund as the state completed the  fiscal year its governmental funds reported a combined fund balance of  billion included in the  fiscal years total change in fund balance is an operating surplus of  million in the states general fund the general fund operating surplus is attributable to several factors including an increase of  billion in personal income tax revenue a  billion increase in business taxes and a  million increase in miscellaneous revenues offset by a  million decline in consumption and use tax revenue much of the increase in tax revenues is related to improvement in the states economy and tax increases enacted for personal income the increase in general fund revenues was offset by a  billion increase in expenditures local assistance expenditures increased by nearly  billion due primarily to increased spending for medical assistance and income maintenance programs state operations increased  million due primarily to negotiated salary increases increased health insurance costs and employer pension costs the state ended the  fiscal year with a general fund accumulated fund balance of  billion the increase of the fund balance is due primarily to an increase in tax revenues as a result of an increase in the personal income tax rate and an improving state economy overall financial position the state reported net assets of  billion as of march   which was comprised of  billion in capital assets reported net of related debt  billion in restricted net assets offset by an unrestricted net assets deficit of  billion net assets reported for governmental activities decreased by  million from a year ago decreasing from  billion to  billion unrestricted net assetsthe part of net assets that can be used to finance daytoday operations without constraints established by debt covenants enabling legislation or other legal requirementshad a deficit of  billion at march   the deficit in unrestricted governmental net assets which declined by nearly  million in  exists primarily because the state has issued debt for purposes not resulting in a capital asset related to governmental activities such outstanding debt included securitizing the states future tobacco settlement receipts  billion eliminated the need for seasonal borrowing by local government assistance corporation  billion local highway and bridge projects  billion local mass transit projects  billion and a wide variety of grants and other expenditures not resulting in governmental capital assets  billion this deficit in unrestricted net assets of governmental activities can be expected to continue for as long as the state continues to have obligations outstanding for purposes other than the acquisition of governmental capital assets net assets for businesstype activities increased by  million  percent to  billion in  compared to  billion in  the increase in net assets for businesstype activities was caused primarily by employer contributions and other revenues exceeding unemployment benefit payments for the unemployment insurance fund  million suny and cuny senior college operating revenues and state support exceeding operating expenses  and  million respectively and offset by lottery losses of  million as of june    billion in debt had been issued and was outstanding to finance capital assets of the states colleges and universities general fund budgetary highlights general fund expenditures exceeded receipts by  million in   the general fund ended the fiscal year with a closing cash fund balance of  billion which consisted of  billion in the tax stabilization reserve account the states rainy day reserve  million in the community projects account  million in the contingency reserve account and  billion in general reserves the states  fiscal year capital budget calls for it to spend  billion for capital projects of which  billion is for transportation projects to pay for these capital projects the state plans to use  million in general obligation bond proceeds  billion in other financing arrangements with public authorities  billion in federal funds and  billion in funds on hand or received during the year debt administration there are a number of methods by which the state may incur debt the state has obtained longterm financing in the form of voterapproved general obligation debt voter approved debt including leasepurchase and contractual obligations where the states legal obligation to make payments is subject to and paid from annual appropriations made by the legislature or assignment of revenue in the case of tobacco settlement revenue bonds one minor exception equipment capital leases and building capital leases which represent  million as of march   do not require legislature or voter approval the state administers its longterm financing needs as a single portfolio of statesupported debt that includes general obligation bonds and other obligations of both its governmental activities and businesstype activities most of the debt reported under businesstype activities all of which was issued for capital assets used in those activities is supported by payments from resources generated by the states governmental activitiesthus it is not expected to be repaid from resources generated by businesstype activities at march   the state had  billion in statesupported variable rate bonds outstanding and  billion in interest rate exchange agreements where the state issues variable rate bonds and enters into a swap agreement that converts the rate effectively to a fixed rate in addition the state had  billion in convertible bonds which bear a fixed rate until future mandatory tender dates at which time they can convert to either a fixed or variable rate at march   variable rate bonds net of those subject to the fixed rate swaps were equal to  of the statesupported bonded debt portfolio at march   the state had  billion in bonds notes and other financing agreements outstanding compared with  billion the year before an increase of  billion the state constitution with exceptions for emergencies limits the amount of general obligation bonds that can be issued to that amount approved by the voters for a single work or purpose in a general election the state finance law through the debt reform act of  the act also imposes phasedin caps on new state supported debt issued and related debt service costs the act also limits the use of debt to capital works and purposes and establishes a maximum length of term for repayment of  years the act applies to all state supported debt the debt reform act does not apply to debt issued prior to april   or to other obligations issued by public authorities where the state is not the direct obligor the construction of certain state office buildings campus facilities and other public facilities has been financed through bonds and notes issued by public benefit corporations pursuant to leasepurchase agreements with the state the state has also entered into financing arrangements with public benefit corporations that have issued bonds to finance past state budgetary deficits and grants to local governments for both capital and operating purposes these leasepurchase and other financing arrangements which the state will repay over the duration of the agreements constitute longterm liabilities the amount included in obligations under leasepurchase and other financing arrangements consists of total future principal payments and equals the outstanding balance of the related bonds and notes reporting relative to capitalized interest is also not included for leased capital assets risk management the state does not insure its buildings or their contents against theft fire or other risks and does not insure its automobiles against the possibility of bodily injury and property damage however the state does have fidelity insurance on state employees workers compensation coverage is provided on a selfinsurance basis litigation the state is a defendant in numerous legal proceedings pertaining to matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations such litigation includes but is not limited to claims asserted against the state arising from alleged torts alleged breaches of contracts condemnation proceedings and other alleged violations of state and federal laws included in the states outstanding litigation are a number of cases challenging the legality or the adequacy of a variety of significant social welfare programs primarily involving the states medicaid and mental health programs adverse judgments in these matters generally could result in injunctive relief coupled with prospective changes in patient care that could require substantial increased financing of the litigated programs in the future actions commenced by several indian nations which include the st regis mohawk indian nation the oneida indian nation and the cayuga indian nation claim that significant amounts of land were unconstitutionally taken from the indians in violation of various treaties and agreements during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the claimants seek recovery of thousands of acres of land as well as compensatory and punitive damages with respect to pending and threatened litigation the state has reported in the governmental activities liabilities of  million for awarded and anticipated unfavorable judgments in addition the state is a party to other claims and litigation that its legal counsel has advised

verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information it is based in part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in new york or contained in official statements for various new york municipal obligations north carolina risk factors economic condition and outlook the impact from the economic slowdown in north carolina was still unrealized by the end of  the state is typically more volatile with respect to economic cycles than the nation as a whole however by early  it was evident the slowdown had begun nationally yet the states economy showed less of an effect than the national economy the mild slowdown experienced by the state in fiscal year  may be due in part to north carolinas relatively mild housing problems for example real estate conveyance tax receipts in north carolina have been essentially flat compared to double digit declines in a many other states it is projected that the biggest impact to the states economy from the midcycle slowdown plus the housing and financial sector slump will occur in  by the end of  the economic and fiscal impacts are expected to dissipate with a return to near normal growth in the state north carolinas impact from the housing slump has been different than many other states there was negative yearoveryear sales growth statewide in existing singlefamily homes for the fourth quarter of  and the second quarter of  and only  percent growth in the first quarter of  the states housing bubble was limited to a few resort areas therefore the statewide impact from the housing slowdown has been far less severe than in many states in addition the state continued to experience strong population growth as well as employment growth which may have dampened the impact from the national housing slump the states population is expected to continue growing at a rate above two percent through  comparatively the nations population is only expected to grow at slightly less than one percent likewise nonfarm employment grew in the state from august  to august  by  percent while national employment grew at only  percent another part of the employment story is the states continued strong growth in the serviceproviding sectors with annual growth above  percent this has more than offset the loss in manufacturing jobs which continued to decline at a rate of  percent an estimated  jobs over this same period north carolinas economy has held up well under the strain of the housing slump and the economic slowdown therefore income growth is projected to continue at a moderate pace and grow only slightly below the longterm average of  percent as with the nation the majority of the housing slumps effects will have worked themselves out by  but residual effects will continue to be a drain on the states economy these impacts show up in slower than normal growth in retail sales and employment the longterm negative growth trends in manufacturing continue as the state transitions from a manufacturing and agricultural based economy to a service and technological economy the past year also saw a slowing of growth in the housing related industries including financial services residential construction and transportation in general north carolinas economy is expected to expand at a faster pace than the nation this should bode well for overall employment and help bolster income growth employment losses in the manufacturing industries will continue but growth in the service and tech industries should continue to be a major stimulus to economic growth there is little doubt that the state will experience an economic slowdown in the next couple of years but it is in a position to perform better than the nation as a whole cash management it is the policy of the state that all agencies institutions departments bureaus boards commissions and officers of the state shall devise techniques and procedures for the receipt deposit and disbursement of monies coming into their control and custody which are designed to maximize interestbearing investment of cash and to minimize idle and nonproductive cash balances the state controller with the advice and assistance of the state treasurer the state budget officer and the state auditor develops implements and amends the statewide cash management policy all cash deposited with the state treasurer by state entities is managed in pooled investment accounts to maximize interest earnings risk management the state maintains selfinsurance programs for employee health general liability medical malpractice workers compensation and automobile fire and other property losses the state limits its risk for general liability medical malpractice and automobile fire and other property losses by purchasing private insurance for losses in excess of deductibles state budget on july   the general assembly passed house bill  state budget act to replace the executive budget act this new legislation was effective july   and affects budget merit and management by simplifying reorganizing updating the current budget statutes and making changes to conform the statutes to the state constitutional provisions governing appropriations the state budget act defines key budget aspects and increases the targeted balance of the general fund savings reserve from  percent to  percent of prior year operating appropriation expenditures the new legislation provides that agency budgets be classified in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as interpreted by the state controller as part of the implementation of the state budget act several budgetary processes and the states budget code structure have been reviewed and revised as appropriate some revisions have required adjustment to the states budgetary and accounting systems the state budget manual has been updated to reflect changes required by house bill  financial analysis of the state as a whole over time increases or decreases in net assets serve as a useful indicator of whether a governments financial position is improving or deteriorating the states combined net assets increased  billion or  over the course of this fiscal years operations the net assets of the governmental activities increased  billion or  and businesstype activities increased  million or  the largest component of the states net assets  billion reflects its investment in capital assets land buildings machinery and equipment state highway system and other capital assets less related debt still outstanding that was used to acquire or construct those assets restricted net assets are the next largest component  billion net assets are restricted when constraints placed on their use are  externally imposed by creditors grantors contributors or laws or regulations of other governments or  legally imposed through constitutional provisions the remaining portion unrestricted net assets consists of net assets that do not meet the definition of restricted or invested in capital assets net of related debt the governmentwide statement of net assets for governmental activities reflects a negative  million unrestricted net asset balance the state of north carolina like many other state and local governments issues general obligation debt and distributes the proceeds to local governments and component units the proceeds are used to construct new buildings and renovate and modernize existing buildings on the states community college and university campuses assist county governments in meeting their public school building capital needs and to provide grants and loans to local governments for clean water and natural gas projects of the  billion of bonds and certificates of participation outstanding at june    billion is attributable to debt issued as state aid to component units universities and community colleges and local governments the balance sheets of component unit and local government recipients reflect ownership of the related constructed capital assets without the burden of recording the debt obligation the policy of selling general obligation bonds and funneling the cash proceeds to nonprimary government nonstate entities has been in place for decades however by issuing such debt the state is left to reflect significant liabilities on its statement of net assets reflected in the unrestricted net asset component without the benefit of recording the capital assets constructed or acquired with the proceeds from the debt issuances additionally as of june   the states governmental activities have significant unfunded liabilities for compensated absences in the amount of  million these unfunded liabilities also contribute to the negative unrestricted net asset balance for governmental activities litigation the state is involved in numerous claims and legal proceedings many of which normally recur in governmental operations and may have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the state debt administration at yearend the state had total longterm debt bonds and similar debt payable outstanding of  billion an increase of  from the previous fiscal yearend during the  fiscal year the state issued  million in general obligation bonds excluding refunding bonds and  million in certificates of participation cops the new general obligation debt represents a consolidation of clean water bonds and higher education bonds and constitutes the remaining authorized amounts of such bonds see next page the proceeds of the cops will be used to finance the repair and renovation of state facilities and related infrastructure  million and various state and university capital projects authorized for special indebtedness financing by previous sessions of the general assembly  million the repair and renovation projects were prioritized based on those projects related to life safety code requirements and water intrusion remediation the state refinanced  million of its existing debt in fiscal year  to improve cash flow and to take advantage of lower interest rates by refinancing the debt the state will reduce its future debt service payments by approximately  million over the next fifteen years the state issues two types of taxsupported debt general obligation bonds and various types of special indebtedness which are also known as appropriationsupported debt general obligation bonds are secured by the full faith credit and taxing power of the state the payments on all other types of longterm debt including cops lease purchase revenue bonds and equipment installment purchase contracts are subject to appropriation by the general assembly some appropriation supported debt is also secured by a lien on facilities or equipment article  of chapter  of the general statutes prohibits the issuance of special indebtedness except for projects specifically authorized by the general assembly the use of alternative financing methods provides financing flexibility to the state and permits the state to take advantage of changing financial and economic environments the states longterm debt bonds and similar debt payable has increased significantly in recent years rising from  billion in  to  billion in  in part due to large issuances for higher education capital projects the budget bill enacted by the  session of the general assembly authorized the issuance of up to  million of special indebtedness eg cops as follows  million for higher education projects significant projects include  million to for a genetics science building at the university of north carolina at chapel hill  million for a nanoscience building to be used jointly by the university of north carolina at greensboro and north carolina agricultural and technical state university  million for a health and gerontological building at western carolina university and  million for an animal hospital at north carolina state university  million to acquire state park land natural heritage land and to acquire waterfront properties or develop facilities for the purposes of providing public and commercial waterfront access  million for an education and visitors center at tyron palace and  million for correctional facilities article  section  of the constitution of north carolina imposes limitations upon the increase of certain state debt it restricts the general assembly from contracting debts secured by a pledge of the faith and credit of the state unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the state except for the following purposes  to fund or refund a valid existing debt  to supply an unforeseen deficiency in the revenue  to borrow in anticipation of the collection of taxes due and payable within the current fiscal year to an amount not exceeding  percent of such taxes  to suppress riots or insurrections or to repel invasions  to meet emergencies immediately threatening the public

ohio risk factors general the state of ohios first constitution was adopted in  and ohio entered the union in  ohios present constitution was modified by a state constitutional convention in  and has since been amended on numerous occasions the constitution establishes a state governmental structure similar to the federal model with three separate branches of government  executive legislative and judicial the executive branch consists of the governor and lieutenant governor who are jointly elected and four additional statewide elected officials the attorney general the auditor of state the secretary of state and the treasurer of state all of these officials are elected to fouryear terms more than  departments agencies boards and commissions are part of the executive branch of government and receive appropriations from the legislature along with the judicial branch and legislative agencies the state legislature in ohio is referred to as the general assembly and consists of two separate chambers the senate a member body and the house of representatives a member body each member of the general assembly is elected to represent the residents of a geographical district for a specified term members of ohios general assembly are subject to termlimits senators are restricted to serving two fouryear terms and representatives are restricted to serving four twoyear terms a new

result general economic activity as in many other industriallydeveloped states tends to be more cyclical than in some other states and in the nation as a whole agriculture is an important segment of the economy with over half the states area devoted to farming and a significant portion of total employment in agribusiness since  payroll employment in ohios diversifying employment base increased in

fourth fiscal year thereafter becomes a new base year reflecting the tax restructuring described above grf appropriations for the  and  fiscal biennia are resulting in the four slowest growing fiscal years with respect to expenditures of the last  years the biennial budgets for these years reduced or held flat many of the states grffunded agencies and consolidated functions or activities of

had slightly more than  million of the three states  million workers in august  oregons largest metro area is the portlandvancouverbeaverton metropolitan statistical area the portland area has the sixth largest number of workers of the seven metro areas with one million or more workers in the three states it includes about half of oregons jobs employment grew more rapidly in oregon than in most neighboring states in the mids due largely to a combination of high net inmigration and a boom in high technology primarily computer chips transportation equipment such as recreational vehicles and heavy trucks and construction the asian financial crisis in  led to weaker manufacturing employment and slower overall job growth in oregon then the national recession hit the state between late  and the middle of  employment fell by as much as  percent much worse than in neighboring states from late  to mid oregon gained jobs at roughly  percent per year then growth slowed markedly from september  to september  oregons employment grew by less than  percent during the rapid job growth of the mids oregons unemployment rate ranked in the middle of all states and lower than its neighboring states however the rate rose with the asian financial crisis during the economic boom of the late s and in  oregons unemployment rate remained above the rates in neighboring states the nation and oregon went into a recession after the burst of the information technology bubble with the onset of the recession oregons unemployment rate soared from just over  percent in late  to a peak of  percent in the middle of  the states population continued to grow despite the high unemployment rate oregon had the nations highest or secondhighest state unemployment rate for  of the  months from may  to august  rapid job growth from late  to mid pulled the unemployment rate down to under  percent by early  it remained between  and  percent through late  oregons major foreign exportrelated industries include computers and electronic products transportation equipment machinery and agricultural crops oregon also ships large values of wood food nursery machinery plastic and paper products to domestic markets and serves foreign and domestic tourists oregons annual employment growth is expected to be  percent in  and   percent in   percent in  and  percent in later years the state is projected to outpace the nations growth rate from  to  job growth is expected to be fastest in professional and business services leisure and hospitality and health care other nonmanufacturing sectors will post robust job gains as the states population increases faster than the nations manufacturing is projected to decline slightly overall employment should grow slightly faster than population during the  through  time period so oregon may continue to have a low unemployment rate during the past ten years the states general governmental expenditures related to education have increased in amount but have decreased as a percentage of total expenditures a tenyear decrease of  percent this relative decline results from a shift in allocation of total expenditures for other program areas such as human services public safety and debt service expenditures the general governmental expenditures related to human services have increased as programs to serve needy oregonians have expanded the percentage of total expenditures is  percent higher than it was ten years ago during this same tenyear period tax revenues while increasing in amount have actually decreased as a percentage of total revenue a tenyear decrease of  percent the reason for this relative decline is the relative increase in general governmental expenditures related to services that are supported more by federal revenues than by taxes eg human services as a percentage of total revenue federal revenues are  percent higher than they were ten years ago reflecting an increased participation in federal assistance programs which benefits oregons citizens the unemployment rate for oregon as of october  was  percent the national rate as of october  was  percent employment growth in the second quarter of  was  percent this marks the sixteenth consecutive quarter of job growth however job gains have been slowing since the first quarter of  a slowdown that has been expected after three years of strong job growth in oregon budgetary process the oregon budget is approved on a biennial basis by separate appropriation measures a biennium begins july  and ends june  of oddnumbered years measures are passed for the approaching biennium during each regular legislative session held beginning in january of oddnumbered years because the oregon legislative assembly meets in regular session for approximately six months of each biennium provision is made for interim funding through the legislative emergency board the emergency board is authorized to make allocations of general fund monies to state agencies from the state emergency fund the emergency board may also authorize increases in expenditure limitations from other or federal funds dedicated or continuously appropriated funds and may take other actions to meet emergency needs when the legislative assembly is not in session the most significant feature of the budgeting process in oregon is the constitutional requirement that the budget be in balance at the end of each biennium because of this provision oregon may not budget a deficit and is required to alleviate any revenue shortfalls within each biennium revenue and expenditures the state budgets on a biennial basis rather than an annual basis for the  biennium final budgeted expenditures for the general fund increased by  million from original budgeted expenditures reflected in the legislatively

factors economic outlook the commonwealth of pennsylvania pennsylvania or the commonwealth historically has been identified as a heavy industry state although that reputation has been changing as the industrial composition of pennsylvanias economy continues to diversify into the service sector including trade medical and health services education and financial institutions pennsylvanias agricultural industries are also an important component of the commonwealths economic structure particularly in crop and livestock products as well as agribusiness and food related industries the national economy slowed dramatically during the first quarter of   percent growth in gross domestic product gdp before rebounding during the second quarter to  percent growth in gdp this rapid turnaround supported continued gains in employment both nationally and within the pennsylvania economy improvements in personal income government finances and jobs growth were recorded during the recently completed fiscal year overall growth in the national economy averaged  percent during fiscal year  from mid to mid growth in the national economy as measured by gdp is expected to average  percent below recent performances continued weakness in the housing market will likely lead to slower growth in the economy significant increases in oil prices will negatively impact the economy and likely reduce consumer expenditures more cautious consumer spending and weakened foreign trade will adversely impact the national and pennsylvania economies in fiscal year  commonwealth financial structure the constitution and the laws of the commonwealth require all payments from the state treasury with the exception of refunds of taxes licenses fees and other charges to be made only by duly enacted appropriations amounts appropriated from a fund may not exceed its actual and estimated revenues for the fiscal year plus any unappropriated surplus available appropriations from the principal operating funds of the commonwealth the general fund the motor license fund and the state lottery fund are generally made for one fiscal year and are returned to the unappropriated surplus of the fund a lapse if not spent or encumbered by the end of the fiscal year the commonwealths fiscal year begins july  and ends june  the general fund the general fund the commonwealths largest operating fund

approximately  percent of the nonfederal general fund budgetary basis revenues general fund expenditures are reported in the following functional assignments along with the related percentage of nonfederal expenditures direction and supportive services  protection of persons and property  health and human services  public education  recreation and cultural enrichment  economic development  transportation  and transfers to debt service funds  for all obligations except those incurred for highway or other special revenue fund purposes continued weakness in the housing sector and escalating oil prices were two of the main factors that resulted in slower growth of the national economy during fiscal year  growth in real gross domestic product gdp finished at  percent for the fiscal year ended june   down from  percent for the prior fiscal year corporate profits growth in wages and salaries and consumer expenditures were all lower during fiscal year  than in the prior fiscal year economic growth proved erratic as said growth was  percent in the first quarter of  but rebounded to reach  percent in the second quarter of  job growth continued during the fiscal year and the unemployment rate continued to drop throughout the fiscal year overall economic conditions positively impacted state revenue growth as revenues exceeded the budget estimate these additional revenues were used in part to replenish portions of reserve funds and to support an increased demand for governmental goods and services particularly in the area of health care costs during the fiscal year ended june   total general fund revenues and other sources exceeded expenditures and other uses by  million and at june   the commonwealth reported an unreservedundesignated fund balance budgetary basis of  million in the general fund this compares to a budgetary basis fund balance of  million restated at june   the budgetary basis results for the fiscal year ended june   include revenue collections totaling  million less appropriation authorizations totaling  million less other net financing uses totaling  million included in the  million appropriation authorizations are  million of state supplemental appropriations and  million in federal supplemental appropriations authorized during the fiscal year ended june   debt administration the constitution of the commonwealth of pennsylvania permits the incurrence of debt without approval of the electorate for capital projects specifically authorized in a capital budget capital project debt outstanding cannot exceed one and three quarters  times the average of the annual tax revenues deposited in all funds during the previous five fiscal years the certified constitutional debt limit at august   was  billion outstanding capital project debt at august   amounted to  billion for a remaining legal debt margin of  billion in addition to constitutionally authorized capital project debt the commonwealth may incur debt for electorateapproved programs such as economic revitalization land and water development water facilities restoration and certain environmental initiatives and for special purposes

motor license fund appropriations to make principal and interest payments to bondholders during the fiscal year ended june   amounted to  million and  million respectively the table that follows shows total outstanding longterm indebtedness for general obligation bonds at the end of the eight most recent fiscal years during the fiscal year ending june   the office of the budget currently plans general obligation bond issuances excluding refundings amounting to  million a decrease of  million as compared to actual bond issuances of  million excluding refundings during the fiscal year ended june   this plan reflects the need to make continued investments in the commonwealths capital infrastructure local capital projects and mass transportation additionally a significant portion of the projected issuances for the  fiscal year is attributable to two major environmental programs which would target capital improvements to water supply and sewage treatment facilities associated with economic development as well as general environmental capital improvement projects debt principal retirements of  million are currently planned for the fiscal year ending june   the commonwealth continues to evaluate refunding opportunities for its outstanding bonds to reduce interest costs during the fiscal year ended june   the commonwealth closed a refunding issue that refunded  million of outstanding bonds and will produce  million of interest savings over the remaining life of those bonds as market conditions provide additional opportunities the commonwealth may pursue additional refundings in addition to general obligation bonds the commonwealth may issue tax anticipation notes to meet operating cash needs during certain months of the fiscal year tax anticipation notes may be issued only for the general fund and the motor license fund they may not exceed  percent of the funds estimated revenues for the year and must mature during the fiscal year in which they were issued cash shortages may occur during the fiscal year because tax receipts unlike cash disbursements are concentrated in the last four months of the fiscal year the commonwealth has not issued tax anticipation notes during the past ten fiscal years and has no plans to issue any during the  fiscal year there were no changes in credit ratings and there were no debt limitations restrictions or commitments during the fiscal year ended june   that may affect the commonwealths plans during the fiscal year ending june   capital asset activity general capital assets as of june   amounted to

largest of the caribbean islands and is located approximately  miles southeast of new york it is approximately  miles long and  miles wide according to the united states census bureau the population of puerto rico was approximately  in   as of july   according to a united states census bureau estimate compared to  in  however the puerto rico planning board the planning board estimates that as of july  the population will be approximately  relationship with the united states puerto rico came under the sovereignty of the united states with the signing of the treaty of paris on december   at the conclusion of the spanishamerican war puerto ricans became citizens of the united states in  by virtue of the jones act approved by the congress of the united states in  the congress of the united states enacted public law  in order to provide for an increased puerto rican selfgovernment this law set forth the political economic and fiscal relationship between puerto rico and the united states it also provided for the drafting and adoption of a local constitution on july   the constitution of puerto rico was drafted by a constituent commission approved in a special referendum by the people of puerto rico amended and ratified by the united states congress and subsequently approved by the president of the united states the official designation of the government or body politic has henceforth been estado libre asociado which literally translates to free associated state and has been called commonwealth by the united states government the united states and the commonwealth share a common defense market and currency puerto rico exercises virtually the same control over its internal affairs as any of the fifty states of the united states however it differs from the states in its relationship with the united states federal government the people of puerto rico are citizens of the united states but do not vote in national elections they can only vote in local puerto rico elections the people of the commonwealth are represented in congress by a resident commissioner who has a voice in the house of representatives and limited voting power puerto rico is a selfgoverning commonwealth in association with the united states the chief of state of the commonwealth is the president of the united states the head of government is an elected governor there are two legislative

differences between puerto rico and the  states are its local taxation system and exemption from internal revenue code its lack of voting representation in either house of the us congress the ineligibility of puerto ricans to vote in presidential elections and its lack of assignation of some revenues reserved for the states economy the commonwealth has established policies and programs directed principally at developing the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy and expanding and modernizing the commonwealths infrastructure domestic and foreign investment have been stimulated by selective tax exemptions development loans and other financial and tax incentives infrastructure expansion and modernization have been to a large extent financed by bonds and notes

of approximately  of puerto ricos imports puerto rico enjoyed almost two decades of economic expansion through fiscal year  almost every sector of the economy participated and record levels of employment were achieved factors behind this expansion included governmentsponsored economic development programs periodic declines in the value of the united states dollar increased in the level of federal transfers a significant expansion in construction investment driven by infrastructure projects and private investment primarily in housing the relatively low cost of borrowing and low oil prices in fiscal year  however planning board figures indicate that the economy of puerto rico registered a decline of  in real gross product the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy are manufacturing and services the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage high technology industries such as pharmaceuticals electronics computers microprocessors professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery and equipment the service sector including finance insurance real estate wholesale and retail trade and tourism also plays a major role in the economy it ranks second only to manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment puerto rico is heavily dependent on oil imports for the production of electricity as a result of the construction of two cogeneration plants however one of which is fueled by liquefied natural gas and the other by coal puerto ricos dependence on oil imports for the production of electricity has been reduced from  to  the commonwealths gross product in fiscal year  was approximately  billion this

improvements machinery and equipment less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding the state uses these capital assets to provide services to its citizens consequently these assets are not available for future spending although the states investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities an additional portion of the states net assets  percent is restricted and

obtained from various state and local agencies in tennessee or contained in official statements for various tennessee municipal obligations texas risk factors general economic information in calendar  the texas economy created jobs at nearly twice the national rate nonfarm employment in the state advanced by  percent or  jobs reaching a total of  million texas jobs in november  the national rate of job growth was  percent for the year as the number of workers increased for the fourth consecutive year joblessness dropped to its lowest rates since  with a texas unemployment rate of  percent in november early in  texas jobless rate edged below the nations for the first time in several years by november with the nations unemployment rate at  percent texas comparative advantage had widened to  percent as evidence of the states relative economic health texas not only added more jobs than any other state in  but added more jobs than secondplace florida and thirdplace california combined in terms of percent change texas ranked fifth for its rate of job growth from november  to november  and was exceeded only by utah wyoming montana and louisiana there were more migrants to texas in  than to any other state with the census bureau estimating that  more people moved to texas during the year than moved away a relatively healthy state economy was one reason but the impact of hurricane katrina in louisiana was another factor contributing to the flow of migrants according to census bureau estimates texas accounted for more than  percent of the nations total population growth between  again more than doubling the increase of california and florida combined despite the positive nature of these statistics overall state economic growth registered no more than average in  the underlying story is that the national economy slowed significantly in  while the texas economy slowed much less the states gross domestic product rose  percent in  for an inflationadjusted increase of  percent this matched the average annual growth rate over the past decade in texas among industries the fastest growth was in the oil and gas industry and the smallest increase was in government and other services unlike in much of the nation construction and real estate activity still contributed to texas growth in  although at a slower pace gross state product in texas reached  trillion dollars in  what really changed in  was the nature of the states economic growth while much of the job growth in  had been spurred by the healthy construction and energy sectors mortgage lending and singlefamily housing starts followed national trends and withered considerably in  causing a shift in construction toward multifamily projects and roads oil prices in  stabilized somewhat after a threeyear runup but still fueled job opportunities in the states energydriven businesses although higher fuel prices have negative effects on consumers they still have a modestly positive effect on the states overall economy because the oil and natural gas industry provides texas with a large number of relatively high paying jobs from drilling and marketing operations around the world in  goodsproducing industries in texas grew at a faster rate than the serviceproviding industries but in  the more typical pattern returned and serviceproviding industries grew at a faster pace natural resources and mining which was up  percent was still the states fastest growing industry during the year while construction up  percent slowed down compared to last year manufacturing down  percent lost jobs after three years of job increases with increased oil and gas rig production the states manufacturing industry was spurred in  by hiring in machinery and fabricated metal manufacturing but losses in computers and electronics fabrication overshadowed these gains with outsourcing and productivity gains losses in manufacturing employment would have been even greater had it not been for another year of strong export growth the us dollar continued to weaken during the year making exports a bargain overseas texas has been the nations largest exporting state since  and during the first  months of  the states exports to other countries totaled  billion up  percent from the first  months of  texas exports have increased  percent over the last five years and now account for  percent of the states gross product texas currently accounts for more than oneseventh of total us exports based on export data from the world institute of social and economic research wiser current economic information after posting extraordinary gains in  consumer confidence in the west south central states began edging back in the latter half of  but it remained at a healthy level  points above its  baseline in december  since it is a major factor driving housing and other major purchases consumer confidence is a key indicator to economic health high energy prices although a draw on much of the economy still have a small positive effect on the states total gross state product as long as they remain sufficiently high to stimulate domestic and international drilling the number of operating oil and gas rigs has increased  percent since dropping to  rigs in  including a  percent gain over the past year with an average of  drilling rigs in operation at the end of the year  was the states most active year for oil and gas exploration since  the singlefamily housing market following national trends is the weak link in the economy today although the problem is far less pronounced in texas singlefamily housing permits fell by  percent in texas during the first  months of  compared to the same period of  steep declines in the housing arena have the potential to upset the national economy which would certainly be felt in texas with several years of consumer spending fueled by mortgage equity withdrawals and home equity loans consumer spending has outstripped income growth there will be a substantial pull on wholesale and retail sales activity when this pattern stops on the bright side of the texas housing market multifamily housing permits for projects with five or more units increased  percent during the first  months of  texas home prices rose  percent over the past year keeping up a trend of increases since  even with steep declines in prices in much of the nation texas continues to have some of the most undervalued residential real estate in the country relative to household income as calculated by global insight inc the average price of a texas house stood at  in the fall of  according to a moving average of monthly data from the texas am real estate center although prices have remained firm sales of existing homes in texas during the first  months of  fell by  percent sales tax collections in texas an indicator of taxable retail sales activity grew by a robust  percent in calendar  following a particularly strong  percent increase in  and growth every year since  vehicle sales tax receipts rose by  percent in  texas is set to reach its sixteenth year of increases in new business incorporations based on data for the first  months of  in  the state had a monthly average of  new incorporations compared to the previous years average of  newly incorporated businesses are not always economically viable but the growing number reflects an entrepreneurial willingness to invest in new ventures at the close of calendar  four of the states  leading economic indicators pointed toward an improved state economy in the upcoming months positive signs include an increase in new business incorporations continued brisk growth in retail sales increasing stock values in texas corporations and higher oil prices in contrast consumer confidence has begun to falter albeit from a high level housing permits are off substantially and the average manufacturing workweek is getting shorter also the us leading economic index is tending downward the texas leading index reflects various possible outcomes for  but somewhat subdued economic growth is expected to continue texas gross domestic product growth has outperformed us growth in all but one year since  the comptrollers econometric forecast model predicts that the texas increase will again exceed forecasted us growth in both  advancing by  percent in  and another  percent in  this will exceed the nations growth rate by about one percentage point in  and an estimated tenth of a percentage point in  employment growth in texas will be  percent in  and  percent in  compared to a national annual average of  percent the states population growth in  will stay near  percent with net migration contributing an estimated  percent of total growth for  the states population will average  million the price of oil remains unpredictable texas benefited from the impact of high energy prices on the states oil and gas production manufacturing and services sectors over the past three years however if oil and natural gas prices continue to climb the national economy could easily slide into recession although texas would be somewhat insulated from a recessions negative effects because of its relatively heavy concentration in the oil and gas industry a national recession would nonetheless be felt in texas the state and national unemployment rates are likely to trend upward with texas averaging about  percent unemployment for  while growth in the global economy and a declining dollar have boosted us export growth there are signs the european economy is losing momentum although economic growth in asia looks solid any slowdown in us exports will be felt in texas largely because texas is the nations largest exporting state the continued low value of the us dollar will price texasmade products and service more competitively overseas allowing exports to add fuel to economic growth personal income growth in texas is expected to remain healthy although it will slow somewhat job growth helped personal income expressed in nominal terms to increase by  percent annually over the past two years but slower job growth and reduced corporate profits should temper this to a  percent annual rate for  the texas economy should outpace the us economy for the same reasons that it is outperforming the national economy today these include continued net migration into the state a sunbelt location at the middle of the nations most vibrant economic regions  the south and the west an experienced workforce a comparatively healthy housing market a strategic geographic position for latin american trade an oil and gas industry serving as a buffer for high fuel prices and a relatively low cost of doing business fiscal matters the state operates on a fiscal year basis which begins on september  and ends
