premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search forget breitburn energy partners lp here are  better dividend stocks breitburn energy has let income investors down here are a couple of alternatives that should hold up in the tough oil market reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer feb   at pm breitburn energy partners lps nasdaqbbep distribution is toast the oil and gas driller was supposed to provide a steady stream of income using the limited partnership model to expand production and help unit holders limit their tax hit plunging oil prices put an end to that but that doesnt mean you cant find solid income options in the oil and gas space here are three to consider the best in the worldif you like oil and gas or at least think that the oil rout has beaten the sector to the point of creating upside potential than one place you have to look is exxonmobil nysexom the current yield is around  thats certainly nothing to write home about when competitors such as bp nysebp sport yields as high as  but theres an important difference exxon is probably the bestrun oil company in the world and while its impossible to say that any oil company is immune to a dividend cut in what is a particularly deep industry downturn exxon is holding up well relative to its peers exxonmobil logo source exxonmobil for example exxon was able to generate nearly  billion in cash flow in  down  year over year capital spending was about  billion bp had much less wiggle room with cash flow of around  billion last year a drop of nearly  and capital expenditures of  billion but the future is even more telling as exxon heads into  its pegged capital spending at  billion a cut of around  that makes sense being that oil prices continue to be weak and cash flow is likely to fall year over year bps best case scenario on capital spending in  meanwhile is for a cut of just under but capital spending could also rise slightly to  billion based on its current projections in other words it looks like exxon is in a much better position to ride out the downturn while still generating enough cash flow to cover its capital spending plans   this is just one example but it shows that theres a reason why bp yields so much and exxon is among the lowest yielding oil majors if you got burned by breitburns distribution cut but still want some oil and gas exposure it might be time to err on the side of caution  exxon is one of the safest oil and gas majors around xom dividend yield ttm data by ycharts moving oil  gasanother option you might want to consider is moving oil and natural gas instead of drilling for it there you have a plethora of beatendown limited partnerships to pick from however one of the largest and best run is enterprise products partners nyseepd the partnership has a broadly diversified business a long history of successful operations and expansion and hasnt been hit too badly by the downturn for example in  enterprise posted earnings of  a unit down from  in  thats a drop of around  exxon despite being one of the best oil and gas drillers and its vast chemical and refining operations saw a yearoveryear earnings decline of nearly  its also worth pointing out that enterprises distributable cash flow the cash it can pay out to unit holders actually increased around  year over year whats behind enterprises financial results its largely a toll taker charging customers for moving products across its nearly  miles of pipelines and holding it in its geographically diverse storage facilities it isnt a driller but thats why you might be interested in enterprise in an energy downturn it doesnt have as much exposure to commodity prices one other thing to like at enterprise is that it doesnt have an external general partner eating up valuable cash flow that gives it an advantage on the cost side and allowed it to cover its distribution  times in  and ceo jim teague is talking about a  boost in  assuming the board approves his plan with a distribution yield of around  that sounds like a plan investors could get behind after taking such a deep hit from names like breitburn another lp to consider is buckeye partners nysebpl with a yield hovering around  like enterprise buckeye owns pipelines storage facilities and terminals with more oil available then demand to sop it up storage has been a good business according to ceo clark smith in the third quarter we were successful in increasing utilization as well as rates across our domestic and caribbean assets which contributed significant incremental cash flows its good to have indemand assets and as the us opens its boarders to the global oil trade buckeyes oil terminals should also be in demand that said buckeyes distributable cash flow fell year over year in the third quarter leading to a coverage ratio of just  so theres more risk here than at enterprise but like enterprise buckeye is a big toll taker and its working on a sizable growth project in texas that it expects to improve the coverage ratio and allow for future distribution growth if you can stomach a little nearterm uncertainty buckeye might be worth a deep dive for the extra  percentage points of yield bpl dividend yield ttm data by ycharts cant forget the burnit would be understandable if having lived through breitburns distribution cut and steep share price decline you decided you wanted nothing to do with oil and gas but the truth is that this downturn has opened up some opportunities in good companies exxon for example hasnt yielded as much as it does today in nearly  years enterprise and buckeye are also yielding more than they have in recent years and perhaps equally important all three companies have long histories of annual dividend increases enterprises streak is the shortest at  years sure any one of them could cut their disbursements like breitburn but history and current results suggest thats a risk worth taking on reuben brewer owns shares of exxonmobil
