generally accepted in the united states and are expressed in us dollars principals of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of cls holdings usa inc and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries cls labs inc and cls labs colorado inc  all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates      table of contents cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and  as of november   and may   respectively property plant and equipment property and equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net recoverable amount and is depreciated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives  computer equipment is being depreciated over a three year period concentrations of credit risk the company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits the company continually monitors its banking relationships and consequently has not experienced any losses in such accounts advertising and marketing costs advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred the company incurred no advertising and marketing costs for the three and six months ended november   and  research and development research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred the company incurred  and  of research and development costs for the six months ended november   and  respectively income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company’s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided to the extent deferred tax assets may not be recoverable after consideration of the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income   fair value of financial instruments under fasb asc  the financial accounting standards board establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement reaffirms that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements as reflected herein the carrying amounts of accrued expenses reported on the balance sheet are estimated by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short term nature of the instruments the company had no items that required fair value measurement on a recurring basis revenue recognition for revenue from product sales the company recognizes revenue using four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded the company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required the company has not generated revenue to date      table of contents basic and diluted loss per share basic net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period while fullydiluted net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive securities assumed to be outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method potentially dilutive securities consist of options and warrants to purchase common stock and convertible debt basic and diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period   the company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of outstanding stock options and warrants stock options and warrants for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share and accordingly are excluded from the calculation a net loss causes all outstanding stock options and warrants to be antidilutive as a result the basic and dilutive losses per common share are the same for the three and six months ended november   and  commitments and contingencies   certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur  the company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment  in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s financial statements  if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed recent accounting pronouncements      in april  the fasb issued asu  “simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” “this update” as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the fasb received feedback that having different balance sheet presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discount and premium creates unnecessary complexity recognizing debt issuance costs as a deferred charge that is an asset also is different from the guidance in international financial reporting standards ifrs which requires that transaction costs be deducted from the carrying value of the financial liability and not recorded as separate assets additionally the requirement to recognize debt issuance costs as deferred charges conflicts with the guidance in fasb concepts statement no  elements of financial statements which states that debt issuance costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing thereby increasing the effective interest rate concepts statement  further states that debt issuance costs cannot be an asset because they provide no future economic benefit to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years for all other entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december   the company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting this asu if it is deemed to be applicable management does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements      table of contents   note  – going concern as shown in the accompanying financial statements the company has incurred net losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of november   further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the

  at november   and may   the company had a working capital deficit of  and  respectively this working capital deficit occurred primarily because we have not yet commenced earning revenues  we anticipate that we will commence earning revenues by the second quarter of   during the six months ended november   we obtained loans from our officers and directors to cover operating expenses and expenses related to the merger and the colorado arrangement  this deficit will likely continue to increase until we begin earning revenues but should not be viewed as an indicator of our future performance once we commence earning revenues we have operated at a loss since inception on april   the company issued the convertible note to an unaffiliated individual in the amount of   interest accrues on the convertible note at a rate of  per annum on the first anniversary of the convertible note the company shall pay all then accrued interest thereafter the company shall make eight  equal

pay for investor relations services issued stock to its new coo and incurred deferred compensation owed to its ceo for the entire sixmonth period versus only two months during the comparable period in   the increase was also due to the amortization of the debt discount associated with the companys  convertible loan deferred liabilities associated with the colorado arrangement and an increase in accounts payable because the company was incurring expenses associated with the colorado arrangement but has not yet commenced earning revenue cash flows from investing activities used  during the six months ended november   compared to  during the six months ended november    during  the company invested in equipment  during  the company paid a fee to acquire the public shell cash flows from

colorado arrangement and related agreements the repayment of the convertible loan and the loans from jeffrey binder and frank koretsky the implementation of our business plan and the development of alternative revenue sources  additionally we anticipate that we will devote resources to research and development related to the refinement of our patent pending proprietary methods and processes and development of new products we estimate research and development costs of between  and  during the next  months  finally during the next  months we plan to construct and open two to three processing facilities for use either by a licensee or by us directly  we anticipate that the build out and opening of each processing facility will require between  and  in capital with additional capital required for liquidity to cover personnel equipment and other operating expenses with respect to each opened facility   we currently have two employees jeffrey binder who serves as the chairman president and chief executive officer of the company and alan bonsett who serves as the chief operating officer of the company   in an effort to assist us conserve cash mr binder has deferred all of his salary approximately  as of november   to date  mr bonsett is entitled to a onetime signing bonus of  post reverse split shares of restricted common stock of the company which will become fully vested one year from the effective date of his employment agreement  as of november   no shares had been issued  the company valued the shares at  and is amortizing them over the term of the employment agreement  during the six months ended november   we recognized  in share based compensation which is included in stock payable on the accompanying balance sheet we also utilized the services of outside investor relations consultants  pursuant to a consulting agreement we paid a consultant a monthly fee of  at the beginning of each month and awarded the consultant  shares of restricted common stock that vested at a rate of  shares per month  during the three months ended may   we paid  to the consultant and  post reverse split shares vested  we terminated the consulting agreement during the three months ended august   and issued the  shares common stock that had vested of which  shares with a value of  were included in stock payable as of may   pursuant to a consulting agreement we paid  and issued  shares of common stock valued at  to a consulting firm in exchange for investor relations consulting services the consulting agreement was subsequently amended whereby we paid the consultant an additional  issued  shares of common stock valued at  and agreed to issue the consultant an additional  shares of common stock valued at  for future consulting services we are in discussions regarding whether any additional shares have been earned and it is uncertain whether these additional shares will be issued pursuant to a consulting agreement the company paid  and agreed to issue  shares of common stock per month valued at  to a consultant in exchange for investor relations consulting services the consulting agreement was terminated during the first month of its term  the parties are in discussions regarding whether any shares of the companys common stock have been earned and it is uncertain whether any shares will be issued  we plan to hire a chief financial officer administrative staff a lab manager and a consultant for a total of approximately six employees  in addition each processing facility will require six to eight employees depending upon the size of the facility we also intend to use the services of independent consultants and contractors such as our investor relations consultant to perform various professional services when appropriate we believe the use of thirdparty service providers may enhance our ability to control general and administrative expenses and operate efficiently as we implement our business plan currently there are no organized labor agreements or union agreements and we do not anticipate any in the future we are unable to estimate the cost of additional personnel at this time but we expect such costs to be significant   we do not currently have the capital necessary to meet our liquidity needs fund our capital requirements or implement our business plan we intend to fund our cash flow and capital requirements during the next year from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock by obtaining additional loans and with cash generated through operations in connection with the colorado arrangement there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our needs however as we have not yet received any commitments for the purchase of our equity securities or for additional loans  further although we anticipate that we will begin receiving payments pursuant to the licensing agreement and equipment lease during the second quarter of  the colorado arrangement has not generated revenue to date and as described above there can be no assurance that it will ever generate sufficient cash to repay the  loan from cls labs colorado or to meet prhs obligations under the licensing agreement or equipment lease we anticipate that we will incur operating losses during the next twelve months    table of contents going concern   our financial statements were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business we have incurred continuous losses from operations since inception have an accumulated deficit of  and had a working capital deficit of  at november   in addition we do not currently have the cash resources to meet our operating commitments during the next twelve months our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems expenses and complications frequently encountered by developmental stage companies our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our cash needs to borrow capital and to sell equity to support the opening of processing facilities and to finance ongoing operations there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional debt or equity capital andor that cash generated by our future operations will be adequate to meet our needs these factors among others indicate that we may be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results or operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors   recently issued accounting standards  in april  the fasb issued asu  “simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” “this update” as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the fasb received feedback that having different balance sheet presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discount and premium creates unnecessary complexity recognizing debt issuance costs as a deferred charge that is an asset also is different from the guidance in international financial reporting standards ifrs which requires that transaction costs be deducted from the carrying value of the financial liability and not recorded as separate assets additionally the requirement to recognize debt issuance costs as deferred charges conflicts with the guidance in fasb concepts statement no  elements of financial statements which states that debt issuance costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing thereby increasing the effective interest rate concepts statement  further states that debt issuance costs cannot be an asset because they provide no future economic benefit to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years for all other entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december   the company is currently evaluating the effects of adopting this asu if it is deemed to be applicable management does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted
