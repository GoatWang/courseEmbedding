wireless services grows even as the spectrum shrinks september   by bob kovacs louis libin poses at the usafrica leaders’ summit held aug  in washington new york ― juggling the demands for wireless devices―such as microphones cameras and airborne video feeds―at big mediasaturated events is something of an art as the fcc squeezes broadcasters into a reduced spectrum there’s less “white space” available to meet wireless requirements and even greater demand for the frequency coordinator’s art louis libin has been working in the television industry for decades and his lifelong interest in rf ultimately led him to working as a frequency coordinator he is currently the executive director of the advanced television broadcasting alliance and has a consulting company in new york called broad comm inc he previously worked for nbc in new york and has consulted with all the major broadcastersrelated articles pasternack unveils new rf cable assembly designer rf manufacturers at the nab show closing fcc field offices could lead to ‘rf anarchy’ be extra talked with libin about his work as a frequency coordinator what happens on big projects where there is a lot of demand for wireless mics microwave feeds and other wireless services bee how did you get to be a frequency coordinator libin i studied rf in school and i was always interested in wireless one of my first jobs was at nbc i was originally hired to develop graphics systems one day the vp of engineering told me that there was a director of rf systems who was three years from retiring and they needed someone to replace him i was given that time to do whatever needed to be done to learn and prepare for a position as nbc’s rf expert thereafter whenever a large event took place i became involved in the coordination process and eventually made frequency coordination a priority some of the rf gear on the roof of the  us open tennis tournament bee what are the most difficult and demanding situations you encounter with regard to frequency coordination libin i coordinate many major events huge events such as the us open golf and tennis political conventions inaugurations and international summits such as nato but by far the most complicated events are air races which have a zero tolerance for errors and require so many video microwave channels from many different bands bee what are a couple of the unique challenges with coordinating spectrum use at a large event like an nfl football game or other significant production libin at a major event there are always two great challenges the event itself and the media coverage of the event there is also the venue for example the past us open golf tournament was in pinehurst nc pinehurst is very isolated and is fairly rffree on the “other side of the spectrum” is the us open tennis event which is always in flushing meadows park in new york city one mile from la guardia airport seven miles from jfk and five or so miles from manhattan the busiest rf location in the country so we need to accommodate the event and the rf that is required the coverage and security of the event as well the hundreds of visiting media representatives who need to be accommodated sign from the  us open golf tournament explaining frequency coordination to broadcasters bee is there anything a production team can do to make their lives easier in terms of frequency coordination should they plan to use a certain type of equipment or will they get the best results with wireless systems in certain frequency ranges libin production teams today need to follow closely the proceedings at the fcc so they purchase the right equipment they also need to purchase equipment in frequency ranges and bands where most do not purchase the equipment needs to be as agile as possible bee what was your most challenging frequency coordination event from a tv production standpoint why was it so difficult and how did it work out louis libin far left poses with his frequency coordination team at the  us open golf tournament libin every major event frequency coordination has its singular mostchallenging moment in one case it may be someone’s amplifier failed and can’t be found and is putting out spurs across an entire band in another case we lose a uhf channel because a tv station just powered on and many assignments need to be shifted lately our biggest challenge is simply the lack of space we have begun to run out of space to accommodate all users bee is there anything else be extra readers should know about frequency coordination for large event video production libin frequency coordination for large events has gone through major changes and will continue to change as equipment changes and fcc rules continue to evolve as long as there is good cooperation and good trust between users we should be able to accommodate the production requirements of major events it may be that everyone is mostly satisfied and may have to rethink certain

advertise help subscribe to our rss feed tv station directory directory index phil kurz       email protected tag archives louis libin fcc repack notices exhibit ‘minimal effort’ on lptv says louis libin feb    am edt by phil kurz louis libin executive directors of the atba in a lighter moment one of my contacts for this week’s tech thursday article “repack problematic despite some progress” on the fcc’s jan  repack public notices was louis libin a man who wears many hats many know libin as president and founder of technology consultancy broad comm others have worked with him as national frequency coordinator for rfladen broadcast events like the democrat and republican national conventions libin is also the executive director of the advanced television broadcasting alliance an industry group made up of broadcasters from the lptv translator and fullpower communities it is his role as an advocate for the interests of lowpower and tv translator stations that made me want to get his perspective on the new repack public notices and what they mean for lptv and translator stations what he had to say seemed to deserve standalone coverage so i am presenting it here in the playout blog in a nutshell libin says the public notices reflect “minimal effort” on the part of the federal communications commission “to address the real lptv issues” “they aren’t taking any new approach to lptv we’ve gone through this many times” he says “their solutions for lptv aren’t really solutions” lptv and tv translators are not included in the agency’s phased transition   “i think this is a very big mistake because in this new world the next phase of television which will include atsc  it seems to me that lptv and tv translator stations will play a really big role” says libin on the very day this week’s tech thursday was published the fcc published its notice of proposed rulemaking to authorize deployment of atsc  on a voluntary basis ironically while the commission’s repack rules don’t address the real issue facing lptv and translator stations which can be summarized as no real protection from the outset says libin it is these same stations that can help atsc  realize its full potential “put aside better audio and video for a moment” says libin of nextgen tv enhancements “one of the biggest benefits of atsc  is amazing mobile service not just in one location but an entire coverage area or dma” lptv and tv translator stations are located “all over the place” he says this means they will be critical to a broadcast future where delivering mobile service is an important piece of the industry’s overall business model “lptv will survive be strong and have a more important role to play because of these new requirements of broadcasting” he says let the rf war games begin may    am edt by phil kurz camera crews gather days before the opening of the  republican national convention to participate in rf war games photo kevin parrish next up for louis libin and the other tv engineers coordinating frequency use at this year’s democratic and republican political conventions is a pair of what’s dubbed rf war games — highly organized methodical tests designed to track down and correct any source of harmful interference before each event begins “the rf war games are a very very important because they give us confidence that we understand what is going on inside the building and that there are no surprises” says libin who has served as the top frequency coordinator at the political conventions for at least the past five presidential cycles for broadcasters the games also provide an opportunity to make sure they have built out their wireless networks correctly and are not experiencing any interference the rf war games are staged on the floor of each venue on two separate days leading up to each convention typcially three days before each convention all of the rf systems are brought online in a highly staged systematic fashion to allow frequency coordinators to identify sources of interference libin says “we try to start with only the continuous systems on meaning the ifbs for example” he explains “slowly we bring up wireless mics in the vhf and then we bring in the lower uhf and then the upper uhf “and once those all sound clear we have them turn on their communications and then we have them turn on their microwave video” he says the approach makes it easier to find an offending rf needle in the massive haystack then one day before each convention the process is repeated to make sure that steps taken to correct any problems actually worked libin says often the tests reveal the source of interference to be something other than broadcast equipment for instance at the  republican national convention venue in tampa fla a noisy lighting ballast in the convention hall generated wideband noise across some of the uhf and microwave spectrum to be used by broadcasters libin says “it seems like there is always a problem at the venues” and the rf war games give libin and the other frequency coordinators a chance to get on top of it before the conventions open their doors parting comments on wireless mics jun    pm edt by phil kurz this week’s technology feature article “the future of wireless mics is full of static” like so many others i have written recently revealed lots of interesting developments that just didn’t fit in the story so once again i rely on the playout blog to cover details that didn’t make it into the story in no particular order of importance they include in addition to having its petition for reconsideration on preserving two reserve channels for wireless mic use in each tv market denied sennheiser’s filing requesting the fcc require incentive auction winners to pay on a prorated basis the cost of wireless mic equipment made obsolete by the repack was denied according to joe ciaudelli head of spectrum affairs for the company wireless mic makers have requested the commission allow existing  mhz mics to continue operating until the their users are notified by auction winners that they have built out their new spectrum rather than the  months the agency has given tv broadcasters to vacate and relocate to new channels says dennis wallace chairman of the sbe’s national frequency coordination committee given the strong possibility that wireless mics will be operating in various disparate bands eng crew wireless mics are likely to be frequency agile to accommodate the new requirements in the future says mark brunner spokesman for shure the fcc was initially surprised by the number of wireless mic users — particularly part  users — because many avoided obtaining a license even though they were eligible the process is “onerous” and the application is “quite technically challenging to fill out” says howard kaufman lectronics technical representative clearcom which began  years ago to move out of the uhf band with wireless intercoms and other gear got a head start because it recognized many years ago the desire of governments in europe to reclaim uhf spectrum says simon browne director of product management for the company the fcc office of engineering  technology is more realistic about the impact of the repack on wireless mic users than fcc chairman thomas wheeler says louis libin frequency coordinator for new york city “they know the real truth and the real truth is we are entering a phase where there are no interim solutions to the wireless mic spectrum shortage right now” he says search search for search for
