liabilities  statement of operations  statement of changes in net assets  financial highlights  notes to financial statements for more information back cover the fund the dreyfus premier third century fund inc letter from the president dear shareholder we are pleased to present this semiannual report for the dreyfus premier third century fund inc covering the sixmonth period from june   through november   inside youll find valuable information about how the fund was managed during the reporting period including a discussion with the funds portfolio managers paul a hilton and maceo k sloan when the reporting period began the us economy was showing signs of continued strength characterized by high levels of consumer spending and low levels of unemployment these conditions raised concerns among investors that inflationary pressures might reemerge in response the federal reserve board raised shortterm interest rates three times during the reporting period in an effort to forestall inflationary pressures because higher interest rates tend to increase the cost of capital and make fixedincome securities more competitive relative to equities many sectors of the stock market declined when the federal reserve board raised interest rates technology stocks which advanced on investor speculation in highflying internet companies represented one of the few exceptions to this trend toward the end of the reporting period however stocks representing a number of different market sectors began to rally as investors became optimistic that the adverse effects of recent and impending interestrate increases had already been incorporated into the prices of most stocks we appreciate your confidence over the past six months and we look forward to your continued participation in the dreyfus premier third century fund inc sincerely stephen e canter president and chief investment officer the dreyfus corporation december   discussion of fund performance paul a hilton and maceo k sloan portfolio managers how did the dreyfus premier third century fund inc perform relative to its benchmark for the sixmonth period ended november   the dreyfus premier third century fund inc class z shares produced a total return of  in contrast the funds benchmark the standard  poors  composite stock price index  s p  index  produced a total return of  for the same period the public offering of the funds class a b c r and t shares commenced on august   from august   to november   the fund achieved a total return of  for class a shares  for class b shares  for class c shares  for class r shares and  for class t shares we are very pleased with the funds returns and attribute our strong performance to our emphasis on technology stocks a market sector that performed exceptionally well over the past six months and an area in which we made good choices in our individual stock selection our holdings in the consumer cyclical and healthcare groups also helped drive performance what is the funds investment approach the fund seeks to provide capital growth by investing in high quality growthoriented companies that generally exhibit three characteristics improving profitability measurements a pattern of consistent earnings and reasonable prices current income is a secondary objective to pursue these goals the fund invests primarily in the common stock of companies that in the opinion of the funds management meet traditional investment standards while simultaneously conducting their businesses in a manner that contributes to the enhancement of the quality of life in america the fund discussion of fund performance continued what other factors influenced the funds performance at the beginning of the sixmonth reporting period many overseas economies were well into recovery from last falls economic crises as many global economies continued to strengthen investors became more comfortable holding riskier assets at the end of the last reporting period market sentiment moved away from domestic largecap growth stocks to include a broader group of companies however by the end of the summer the equity markets began to narrow again once again favoring largecap growth names while the equity markets have recorded strong gains during the last six months those gains have been accompanied by heightened volatility in a rising interestrate environment in fact only a few sectors of the equity markets performed well this past year  most of the gains were limited to technology stocks and to a lesser degree telecommunication stocks what is the funds current strategy we continue to maintain our strategy of seeking companies that produce consistent earnings but are reasonably priced while we currently plan to maintain our emphasis on technology and healthcare stocks we have also begun to increase our exposure to financial stocks because we believe their valuations have become attractive in our view many financial companies have become adept at maintaining their companies growth rates in rising interestrate environments we are particularly interested in companies with a large percentage of their business in feebased accounts because we believe they are best positioned to improve their earnings regardless of the direction of interest rates can you give us an update on recent activity in the field of socially responsible investing in our last report we discussed a shareholder resolution facing home depot the large home improvement retailer the resolution was intended to stop the sale of building products made from oldgrowth wood we voted in favor of this resolution subsequently on august   home depots president and ceo arthur m blank pledged to stop selling wood products from environmentally sensitive areas and by the end of the year  to eliminate wood from endangered areas from all of its stores in addition blank said the company was working to ensure that the transition is completely transparent to customers and that it will not appreciably affect pricing or product availability we are pleased with home depot s actions which have apparently started a trend among other home improvement retailers for example homebase the irvine cabased chain and wickes lumber followed suit by announcing plans to stop selling wood from endangered old growth forests it is expected that several other home improvement retailers will follow the lead set by these three companies in other industry news on november   the social investment forum a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting socially and environmentally responsible investing released a report stating that today more than  trillion is invested in the united states in a socially responsible manner this reflects an  rise from  levels however what may be even more significant is the rise in socially responsible assets versus the growth of overall stock market investing according to the report socially responsible assets grew at roughly twice the rate of all assets in the market in the us which climbed  during the same time period we are very pleased with the findings of the report and believe it clearly illustrates that a growing number of americans are investing their money in a fashion that is aligned with their social and environmental values december    total return includes reinvestment of dividends and any capital gains paid and does not take into consideration the maximum initial sales charge in the case of class a and class t shares or the applicable contingent deferred sales charge imposed on redemptions in the case of class b and class
