micro products ambiq micro is redefining “ultralow power” with their revolutionary subthreshold power optimized technology spot™ platform the patented spot architecture uses transistors operating in the extremely low subthreshold voltage region to reduce energy usage by an order of magnitude ambiq micro’s lineup of ultralow power microcontrollers mcu and realtime clocks rtc based on the spot platform are ideal for batteryoperated applications where optimal powerefficiency is essential wearables smart cards wireless sensors  iot ambiq micro products ultralow power mcus ultralow power rtc subthreshold power optimized technology spot™ ambiq micro’s unique and proprietary spot platform provides unparalleled energy efficiency with its breakthrough subthreshold design the spot platform utilizes the leakage from “off” transistors to compute in both the digital and analog domains thereby eliminating the need for transistors to turn all the way “on” by handling most computations using only leakage current spot reduces total system power consumption down to the nanoamp range subthreshold operation can reduce energy usage by an order of magnitude the spot platform does not impact performance ambiq micro’s products behave just like any other semiconductor device the one difference dramatically reduced power consumption about ambiq micro ambiq micro was founded in  based on the notion that extremely low power semiconductors are key to the future of electronics ambiq micro developed its patented subthreshold power optimized technology spot™ platform to deliver dramatically reduced power consumption for semiconductor devices the company has offices in austin texas and san jose california the fujitsu advantage fujitsu electronics is proud to be an investor and official distributor of ambiq micro products including the company’s lineup of ultralow power microcontrollers and realtime clocks for more than  years fujitsu has been a trusted global technology leader fujitsu electronics is a distributor you can trust with more than  years of experience supporting semiconductor and systems customers throughout the americas our extensive expertise in system design
