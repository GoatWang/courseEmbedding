research strategy it is a widely used methodology in many disciplines particularly cultural anthropology but also sociology communication studies and social psychology its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals such as a religious occupational or sub cultural group or a particular community and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their natural environment usually over an extended period of time  to achieve this terrill went undercover as a wildlife smuggler in a later film called women trade that exposed criminal gangs trading in women from the developing world for the sex market in europe terrill posed as a woman trader in the dominican republic as well as in denmark and belgium  uppercut also has a small but vibrant arts department which specialises in theatre based films due to terrills passion for live theatre when you have your own film company you can choose what films you want to make—it is like having a massive toybox full of all your favourite toys and you can keep getting new ones terrill sept 00 when asked why he chose to make theatreland at the same time as working with the royal marines  jimmy savile was a previous recipient of the honorary green beret although he did not attempt all four commando tests in any case since the scandal over his activities with under age girls savile has been posthumously stripped of his honorary green beret gethin jones attempted the last of the tests the 0mile run across dartmoor but finished in a time of  hours 0 minutes – 0 minutes over the pass time of  hours  for this series terrill spent eight months in prison  terrill has established a reputation as the thinking mans adventurer his quests invariably lead him to the worlds hotspots and his focus is usually on the victims of war poverty or natural hazards his approach is analytical and searching and his films are not typical made for tv adventure the radio times published one article about terrills work which was titled rather provocatively meet the explorer who makes bear grylls look like barbie  this series was shortlisted for the 00 mind mental health media awards and one of the films main contributors marine danny claricoates received the speaking out award for his courage in talking so openly about his own post traumatic stress disorder after seeing his two best friends

many disciplines particularly cultural anthropology but also sociology communication studies and social psychology its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals such as a religious occupational or sub cultural group or a particular community and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their natural environment usually over an extended period of time  to achieve this terrill went undercover as a wildlife smuggler in a later film called women trade that exposed criminal gangs trading in women from the developing world for the sex market in europe terrill posed as a woman trader in the dominican republic as well as in denmark and belgium  uppercut also has a small but vibrant arts department which specialises in theatre based films due to terrills passion for live theatre when you have your own film company you can choose what films you want to make—it is like having a massive toybox full of all your favourite toys and you can keep getting new ones terrill sept 00 when asked why he chose to make theatreland at the same time as working with the royal marines  jimmy savile was a previous recipient of the honorary green beret although he did not attempt all four commando tests in any case since the scandal over his activities with under age girls savile has been posthumously stripped of his honorary green beret gethin jones attempted the last of the tests the 0mile run across dartmoor but finished in a time of  hours 0 minutes – 0 minutes over the pass time of  hours  for this series terrill spent eight months in prison  terrill has established a reputation as the thinking mans adventurer his quests invariably lead him to the worlds hotspots and his focus is usually on the victims of war poverty or natural hazards his approach is analytical and searching and his films are not typical made for tv adventure the radio times published one article about terrills work which was titled rather provocatively meet the explorer who makes bear grylls look like barbie  this series was shortlisted for the 00 mind mental health media awards and one of the films main contributors marine danny

such as a religious occupational or sub cultural group or a particular community and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their natural environment usually over an extended period of time  to achieve this terrill went undercover as a wildlife smuggler in a later film called women trade that exposed criminal gangs trading in women from the developing world for the sex market in europe terrill posed as a woman trader in the dominican republic as well as in denmark and belgium  uppercut also has a small but vibrant arts department which specialises in theatre based
