former royal bank of scotland chairman sir tom mckillop resigned from the board of bp today to avoid the humiliation of a protest vote against his reelection at this months annual meetingmckillop will leave at the  april annual meeting he took the decision to resign the day after his public row with city minister lord myners over a £00ayear pension for sir fred goodwin escalatedas mckillop announced he was resigning myners was being forced to answer a private notice question tabled by the tories to insist there was no discrepancy on matters of substance between the two mens accounts of what and when he knew about goodwins pensionthe decision by mckillop and other members of the rbs board to sanction the payment to the former rbs chief executive will result in the rbs remuneration report being voted down at its annual meeting on friday by the government body that holds a controlling stake in the bank mckillop is bearing the brunt of investor anger about the goodwin pension and the near collapse of rbs leading institutional investors had been considering whether to register their feelings by abstaining or voting against his reelection to the bp board bp insiders insisted there was no question of mckillop facing pressure to go from the company but one source conceded that mckillop had in effect accused myners that must put him in the firing line of the government nowrbs has traditionally enjoyed close contacts with the oil industrybp chief executive tony hayward indicated that the board had not pushed mckillop he said tom has provided wise counsel to me and the entire board i am sorry he did not feel he could continue to serve with us we will miss himmckillop said he felt it was an appropriate step for me to take at this timebp is chaired by peter sutherland who was a dominant figure on rbss board until last months boardroom clear out sutherland is planning to leave bp before next years annual meetingmyners said yesterday the critical factor in the row was whether the rbs board had discretion about goodwins pension in a letter to the treasury select committee chairman john mcfall he stressed the new rbs board was conducting a serious and
