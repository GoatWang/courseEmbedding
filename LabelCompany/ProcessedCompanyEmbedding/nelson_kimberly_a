kimberlyclark is banking on bamboo  greenbiz home toggle navigation why kimberlyclark is banking on bamboo why kimberlyclark is banking on bambookristine wongfriday november    am when kimberlyclark announced its plan to source  percent of its wood fiber to alternative sources by   more than the amount that’s in three billion rolls of toilet paper  the company wasn’t quite sure how it would make that happen it’s a tall order even for the one of the world’s top suppliers of facial tissue toilet paper and paper towels “we don’t know how we’re going to get there yet” brenda nelson a director of business planning and sustainability for the companys family care division told greenbiz “it’s not like there was a lot of precision around number and years” she said of the pledge made in june so why would kimberlyclark best known for its kleenex huggies and scott brand products commit to an actual deadline after all walmart famously announced goals to become  percent supplied by renewable energy and create zero waste  yet failed to disclose a timeline like the advice given to benjamin the young man searching for a future in the  film “the graduate” the answer lies in one word kimberlyclark is banking on bamboo “we did enough research on the fibers and potential barriers to know that it’s achievable” nelson said “ was a date we put out there to hold ourselves accountable to make it happen” mitigating risk in  kimberlyclark used  million metric tons of fiber to manufacture its products according to company figures less than onethird of that amount –  million metric tons  came from recycled sources the company reported eighty percent of kimberlyclark’s product line contains wood fiber its primary sources are from the us brazil and canada in a  report the company describes itself as “highly reliant” on the material  in the last few years kimberlyclark has been hunting for a commercially viable alternative to wood fiber in  the company adopted a procurement policy requiring  percent of its fiber to be sourced either from fsccertified or recycled sources by  the move brought an end to a fiveyear campaign by greenpeace pressuring the company to cut its ties with suppliers hawking non fsccertified wood the policy also banned the use of any fiber from endangered species but the motivation for the search extends beyond environmental reasons nelson says it’s also an effort to insulate the company from a fiber market marked by volatile prices and a dwindling supply “we’ve taken a long look at what are the outlook and trends in virgin and recycled fiber supply” she says “there’s increasing pressures and demand on land that’s available we know that where there’s constraints in terms of resources we’ll someday have business impacts associated with them” to build the business case for alternative fibers nelson’s team examined a whole range of characteristics for several materials including bamboo and wheat straw a product left over from wheat farming they looked at fiber characteristics biomass available processing requirements and whether the infrastructure needed for processing was available the group also identified barriers to commercializing the materials along with broader trends that could affect the supply after a year of initial rd tests bamboo appears to have become the focus in the company’s alternative fiber strategy kimberly clark is also evaluating other candidates nelson said but declined to disclose more information photo of bamboo in test tubes courtesy booshoot with its ability to grow four times faster than trees  and without fertilizer pesticides or a lot of water  the towering plant from asia is a favorite for companies specializing in sustainable goods as a result the bamboo goods market has grown into a robust industry within the past ten years according to susanne lucas executive director of the world bamboo organization an industry association the annual global bamboo market is currently estimated at  billion a year in  it’s expected to more than double to  billion she says due to increasing commercial applications such as combustion pyrolysis fibers metabolites water purification and phytoremediation for kimberlyclark bamboos ability to grow in the southeastern us as well as be processed locally at wood pulping plants is significant as the company won’t need to invest in new infrastructure nelson said of course kimberlyclark isn’t the first company to take steps toward sourcing sustainable bamboo cape cod massbased bum boosa which makes bamboo toilet paper and baby wipes sources its bamboo from an fsccertified supplier in china according to owner sonja sheasley sheasley says she turned to a chinese source since they accept smaller orders but for companies as large as kimberlyclark volume is a problem because bamboo only flowers once every  to  years there hasn’t been enough of a supply to keep up with the demand bamboo forests around the world have been overharvested to meet consumer demand in fact half of all bamboo species are at risk of extinction due to forest destruction according to a report issued by the united nations but kimberlyclark’s development deal with booshoot a tiny biotech upstart located north of seattle in mt vernon wash has the potential to upturn bamboo sourcing on its end  for the better over the course of  years booshoot developed a nowpatented method using nongenetically modified tissue culture to grow large volumes of bamboo fast enough for it to be sourced at commercial scale “we shattered that scientific bottleneck … it’s really a complicated cloning process” said biologist jackie heinricher booshoot’s founder booshoot’s technology created the solution kimberlyclark was looking for a way to develop a recycled fiber source that could deliver the high volume it needed in a sustainable and economical way the deal under its development deal booshoot is providing kimberlyclark with tens of thousands of bamboo starts for its rd projects the goal to bring bamboo into the companys fiber fold kimberlyclark is testing the plants to see if they can grow efficiently and whether the fiber will hold up to standards expected by consumers such as strength and softness though not exclusive the focus is on the moso species a giant that grows up to  feet tall produces more fiber than wood and captures four times more carbon than most trees because of its fast growth less land is needed to grow bamboo fiber when compared to the same amount of wood fiber it can be harvested in less than a decade if the material passes the tests kimberlyclark will become the largest grower and processor of bamboo in the us nelson said her company is also investigating how to process bamboo “with a lighter footprint less complex processing and a higher yield” than the predominant method currently used which includes carbon disulfide sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide among its inputs bamboo goods company bum boosa employs a processor that uses water steam and friction to pulp the cellulose sheasley said kimberlyclarks trials are being conducted with the potential of using bamboo in products across all types of its tissue products nelson said working with a team of external consultants and advisors the company is also conducting a lifecycle analysis for its products that might be manufactured with bamboo “it’s challenging – especially in this case to do a lca on something theoretical” nelson said “we can’t say for sure when the work will be done but if it shows a negative impact on the total lifecycle that would cause us to pause” one of the issues that the team is investigating is whether bamboo could have an invasive effect on local ecosystems  something thats commonly associated with the plant “it’s a really bold move” said richard brooks a greenpeace forest campaigner in toronto canada who led the successful campaign against kimberlyclark that ended in  brooks predicts kimberlyclark’s alternative fiber goal will send ripples throughout fiber supply chains “we’ve seen it before” he said “you can be sure there are other fortune  companies looking into alternative fibers” “it’s actually hard for companies to be the first to make the first move” brooks said “we’re seeing kimberlyclark make the move get early adopter status and benefits  and other companies quickly follow them” it’s not clear yet whether procter  gamble and georgia pacific  kimberlyclark’s largest competitors in the market  will follow suit  in the months following kimberlyclark’s announcement brooks reports that an increasing number of companies around the world who source fiber  and their pulp suppliers  are asking greenpeace for guidance about alternatives “the conversations we’re having with these companies are more sophisticated” he says “they’re seriously exploring how to start purchasing these types of pulp” brooks who thinks the  percent reduction goal by  is “realistic” gives credit to kimberlyclark “it’s the first time we’ve seen a large announcement that puts a number out there and puts research dollars behind it” he said   still he cautions that there are some actions that the company needs to take as part of its effort to source alternative fiber at commercial scale “there is no third party certification system for alternative fibers right now kimberlyclark needs to come together with other companies and define some minimum criteria before certification is set up” he said referring to social labor and environmental standards he also emphasizes that any potential use of postagricultural wheat straw must be weighed in consideration with the global food supply clark has been working with kimberlyclark along with a group of other external advisors on developing a socially and environmentally responsible alternative fiber supply chain “we know that we can’t do this alone” nelson said “getting the right partnerships in place identifying the stakeholders and who to have conversations with  it’s all important to be successful” “it really is the next step of where the pulp and paper sector and companies need to go” brooks said “we simply don’t have enough forests to be able to supply the growing demands of consumers” topics materials commitments  goals procurement consumer products forestry printing consumer trends
