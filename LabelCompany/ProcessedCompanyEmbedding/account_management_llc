centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical insurance premiums and parking shareholderemployees of a c corporation do

career overview account management posted by the editors on december   overviewyou have sales you have customer service and then you have the account manager am with one foot in each department ams act as the liaison between a company and its clients and its their responsibility to see that those clients are maximizing the value of the products and services provided but theres a large sales component to their job as well its the ams duty to maintain retain and usually upsell to their portfolio of clients or accountsyoull find the account management function at all types of companies including consulting firms service providers and employment advertising and public relations agencies ams with an autopaint company for instance manage the companys relationships with clients like gm or daimlerchrysler or with body shops and autopainting shops at a hightech company ams are the primary point of contact between the company providing the technology and the clients using itwhat youll do ams work closely with clients to determine the clients needs then they make sure their company develops products or services to meet those needs as part of their job ams create budgets and schedules for meeting their accounts needs and enforce deadlines for product development efforts in manufacturing industries or client projects in service industries they also communicate clients agendas to their staff and management and communicate the concerns and capabilities of their company to the clientfrequently ams also identify and solicit new customers so sales is a part of the job as well if you cant stand sales dont go into account management one insider says still the difference between a salesperson and an account manager is that instead of selling the account and then handing it off to customer service the am maintains an active role in the postsale followup in an advertising agency that may mean overseeing execution of ads in a software company it may mean overseeing a rollout of a new system by spending time onsite helping to train the client in a manufacturing company it may mean ensuring that orders are delivered on timewho does well ams need to be detailoriented organization is a key part of the job you will be expected to keep on top of every aspect of a project good communication skills are also necessary ams interact with clients on the one hand and internal staff and management on the otherpromises made to customers must be kept you cant offer more than your company can deliver you need to know exactly what services you can provide and how quickly a project can be completedyoull need to learn as much as you can about your clients only if you have a strong understanding of a clients business strategy will you be able to understand and communicate how your companys products and services can help the clients strategic goalsyoull also need to know all about the industries in which your clients compete the more industry insight you bring to the table the better read up on changing business trends and strategies that knowledge will attract new accounts and keep the ones you already haveunfortunately not all projects go as planned sometimes a client wont like the work that has been done its up to the account manager to fix the problem he or she will talk to the client find out whats wrong and try to come up with a solutionsome clients will be harder to work with than others so ams need to be able to handle stress well they also need to be creative in order to figure out workaround solutions when something goes wrong at times you may need to hold a clients hand as you walk him through a projectfinally when a deadline looms long hours may be required requirementsstart by contacting your campus career center it can put you in touch with alumni already working in the profession if possible ask an alumnus or another current am for an interview to gather information about the career the am can explain how he broke into the field what the job entails and ways to meet other people in the industry as your network of contacts grows you will find out about new positions as they become availableif youre interested in advertising account management and youre lucky enough to be at a school where advertising agencies recruit entrylevel hires be sure to sign up to interview with those agencies when they come to your campus internships are another way in proving yourself as an intern at an advertising or pr agency is a great way to get hired other types of internships can be just as valuable journalism marketing and broadcasting skills can apply to account management this kind of work experience enables you to build up your portfolio and resume companies look for prospective employees who take the initiative and know how to work under a deadlinein hightech fields an engineering degreeor at least some experience with and understanding of the technology provided by the company you want to work forcan be a prerequisite for employmentin some manufacturing industries some account management professionals find that getting certified professional manufacturers representative credentials can help their careersfor higherlevel positions a college degree and significant work experience are required many account supervisors have sales or marketing backgrounds other qualifications include strong written and oral communication skills management experience a cando attitude and a willingness to take initiative job outlookthe outlook for account managers varies by industry if youre interested in working in the us steel industry for instanceor any other industry thats well past its peakyou wont find many opportunities in general though things are looking up businesses have started spending money again on advertising and technology so ams in these and other industries face a rosier future than in recent timesin the longer term manufacturing account management opportunities will likely grow at a slower rate than in other industries but since the advertising industry is projected to grow faster than average in coming years am opportunities in advertising should grow faster than jobs overall and in hightech am opportunities should grow at about the same rate as the economy overall in each of these industries the job outlook will vary in different sectors depending on which are growing and which are more mature for instance while advertising as a whole should offer a slightly aboveaverage job outlook things are more promising for ams who work with interactive ad agencies or sell search engine ads since online marketing is soaring career tracksaccount management responsibilities vary depending on the industry and the nature of the organization client prospecting and solicitation are expected you must build relationships between your organization and its clients customers should feel comfortable coming to you with ideas for new projects and changes to existing onesaccount

webinars blog research about about us leadership team client success stories news careers global locations contact us blog  blog what is key account management mike schultz you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means– inigo montoya people at large companies bandy about the terms key account management and strategic account management in conversation every day ask  people to define what these are or to tell you what the criteria are for an account to be named a key account and you’re likely to get  very different answers when companies lack an effective and universally understood definition of key account management their success is hampered from the start if you can’t define something it’s difficult to develop a strategy around it at rain group we define key account management as a systematic approach to managing and growing a named set of an organizations most important customers to maximize mutual value and achieve mutually beneficial goals there’s a lot packed into the definition each word has been chosen carefully as words create meaning meaning drives behavior and behavior drives results  components of defining key account management as well as having a core definition we find that having a shared understanding of the following six components of key account management helps create focus viewing key accounts as separate from those that are simply large accounts in terms of revenue limiting the number of key accounts and protecting vigorously from uncontrolled and illadvised key account list growth pursuing key accounts as institutional partners such that you build innovation and value together becoming deeply linked to each other’s future allocating key account focus on three core topics penetrating expanding and protecting accounts from competition viewing key accounts as assets that require continued and often significant investment to yield maximum returns these investments often include structuring and aligning your business’ processes and systems to maximize account value viewing key account investment returns as tied to longterm business strategy companies that agree on a definition and the components of a key account can make great headway without agreement however efforts stall out before they can even get started differentiating sales and key account management we spend quite a bit of time differentiating between the concepts of sales and account management with our clients as we wrote in why strategic account management fails – and what to do about it they are not the same thing but they’re both necessary and they work closely together take a look at the stages of rain group’s strategic account management process   account management skills are required throughout but without the sales skills necessary for execution your efforts will not come to fruition in our research the benchmark report on high performance in strategic account management we found that weak strategic account management and sales skills ranked as one of the top challenges for average and belowaverage performers without strong sales skills you can’t create new opportunities penetrate new buying centers inspire clients to pursue new ideas and possibilities understand clients’ buying processes move opportunities forward stand out against the competition make a compelling business case for buying present solutions overcome objections and win new business without account management skills you can’t build a good account strategy or plan won’t put the right team together and won’t be able to work with clients over the long term to maximize the overall strength of relationships learn the key differences between selling and strategic account management here  ways strategic account management and selling are different how to go about building long lasting sales and key account management skills is the topic for another piece but the fact remains your team needs the skills to implement key account plans and implement them well if you want to grow key accounts you first need to create a universal key account definition and make sure everyone understands it agrees with it and lives by it secondly you need your team to excel with both account management and sales skills additional reading new research benchmark report on top performance in strategic account management when we studied strategic account management in   of sales leaders believed there was greater than  revenue growth potential in their existing accounts in a separate more recent research initiative we found that the  priority for sales leaders in the year ahead is to increase business with existing accounts we also discovered that top performers are nearly x more likely to be effective at

nolocom grow your legal practice meet the editors sign in support search search type all products lawyers articles search term location legal topics business formation llcs  corporations llcs limited liability companies llc basics limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a limited liability company llc offers protection from personal liability for business debts just like a corporation however unlike a corporation which must pay its own taxes an llc is a passthrough tax entity the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship moreover while setting up an llc is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship running one is significantly easier than running a corporation here are the main features of an llc limited personal liability like shareholders of a corporation all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor  such as a supplier a lender or a landlord  the creditor cannot legally come after an llc members house car or other personal possessions because only llc assets are used to pay off business debts llc owners stand to lose only the money that theyve invested in the llc this feature is often called limited liability exceptions to limited liability while llc owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions this protection is not absolute this drawback is not unique to llcs however  the same exceptions apply to corporations an llc owner can be held personally liable if he or she personally and directly injures someone personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the llc defaults fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees wages intentionally does something fraudulent illegal or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else or treats the llc as an extension of his or her personal affairs rather than as a separate legal entity this last exception is the most important if owners dont treat the llc as a separate business a court might decide that the llc doesnt really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts to keep this from happening make sure you and your coowners act fairly and legally do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors creditors or other outsiders fund your llc adequately invest enough cash in the business so that your llc can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities keep llc and personal business separate get a federal employer identification number open up a businessonly checking account and keep your personal finances out of your llc accounting books create an operating agreement having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your llcs separate existence for more on this see nolos article the llc operating agreement for more information on llc limited liability protection and the differences in state laws see  llcs and limited  liability  what protection do you get   additional protection business insurance a good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not for instance if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a clients back your liability insurance policy should cover you insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court in addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations insurance can protect the llcs assets from lawsuits and claims but your llc wont be protected if it doesnt pay its bills commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts whether or not theyre personally guaranteed for more information on insurance see nolos article obtaining small business insurance llc taxes unlike a corporation an llc is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes instead it is what the irs calls a passthrough entity like a partnership or sole proprietorship this means that business income passes through the business to the llc members who report their share of profits  or losses  on their individual income tax returns each llc member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs while an llc itself doesnt pay taxes coowned llcs must file form  an informational return with the irs each year this form which partnerships also have to file sets out each llc members share of the llcs profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure llc members are correctly reporting their income for more information on llc taxes see nolos article how llcs are taxed llc management the owners of most small llcs participate equally in the management of their business this arrangement is called member management there is an alternative management structure  somewhat awkwardly called manager management  in which you designate one or more owners or even an outsider to take responsibility for managing the llc the nonmanaging owners sometimes family members who have invested in the company simply sit back and share in llc profits in a managermanaged llc only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the llc choosing manager management sometimes makes sense but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities for more information see nolos limited liability company llc faq forming an llc to create an llc you file articles of organization in some states called a certificate of organization or certificate of formation with the llc division of your state government this office is often in the same department as the corporations division which is usually part of the secretary of states office filing fees range from about  to  now in every state you can  form an llc with just one person many states supply a blank onepage form for the articles of organization on which you need only specify a few basic details about your llc such as its name and address and contact information for a person involved with the llc usually called a registered agent who will receive legal papers on its behalf some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the llc members in addition to filing articles of organization you must create a written llc operating agreement you dont have to file your operating agreement with the state but that doesnt mean you can get by without one the operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the llc members rights and responsibilities their percentage interests in the business and their share of the profits to learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an llc read nolos article how to form an llc to form your llc right now use nolos online llc which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state ending an llc under the laws of many states unless your operating agreement says otherwise when one member wants to leave the llc the company dissolves in that case the llc members must fulfill any remaining business obligations pay off all debts divide any assets and profits among themselves and then decide whether they want to start a new llc to continue the business with the remaining members your llc operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including buysell or buyout provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires dies becomes disabled or leaves the llc to pursue other interests for more information see nolos article plan ahead for llc ownership changes share on google plus

mcdonnell published on april   most popular after many years of debate about the role and importance of account management  is account management dead is account management back  the chatter appears to have died down and everyone seems to be in agreement that account management is indeed valuable and needed however im starting to wonder if everyone is really convinced in our agency reviews and performance evaluations were hearing from many clients that once again the core components of account management  strategy leadership and relationshipbuilding  are missing from their partnerships and when i recently attended a newbusiness meeting at which an agency didnt even have an account person present it made me wonder are we taking account management seriously in hearing from our clients i know that account management is one of the most important investments an agency can make if taken seriously and supported appropriately here are three account management criteria that we see marketers prioritizing in agency reviews criteria that can often mean the difference between good vs great account management and ultimately good vs great clientagency partnerships strategy im putting this criterion first because i think its the most nebulous and misunderstood as departments such as business insights brand planning and media continue to grow in importance strategy for account management means looking at a clients business with a broader view of its industry and competition and then marrying that analysis with communications principles some account management teams are doing this others are not which isnt entirely surprising with so many strategic players in so many disciplines it can feel like an account persons strategic role isnt real heres why its quite real clients expect their agency counterparts to know their business it isnt about becoming the product manager it isnt about line extensions its about bringing your communications expertise to the specific objectives of the business its about bringing new thinking that works within the realities of your clients brand and budget this is the job of account management and if your account team isnt doing it no one is not planning not business insights not media they have their own strategic fish to fry relationshipbuilding even for naysayers the client relationship is still the need everyone points to when quantifying account managements value however we need to define what taking care of the client really means is it the creditcardcarrying pete campbell from mad men martinilunch variety while taking care of the client will always be part of an account managers role agencies are missing a big opportunity if they think thats where the account teams role begins and ends building relationships with clients entails open and honest communication a great account person maintains the trust of the client and a deeper understanding of what works and what doesnt work for its business effective account management leaders anticipate problems vs simply reacting and help their teams navigate through challenging points in the partnership breakdown in communication between the client and agency is one of the top reasons a partnership goes south to elevate the relationship from vendor to partner requires more than just a yes man leadership today agencies talk a lot about the quadrumvirate of account management creative brand planning and media as a successful model and it is however the shared importance of these four disciplines  at some agencies  has brought about the denigration of account managements leadership role further complicating the issue project management has been absorbed into many account management teams execution is clearly a huge piece of an agencys job  and it can be incredibly difficult to focus on anything beyond getting the work out the door  but the account management team needs to be bigger than timelines and todo lists do you have an account leader who is a palpable presence on your team  to clients creative planning and the host of other groups working on the business do you have an account director or higher who can present confidently in front of the clients executive team is there someone on the account side whom the creative director or higher respects for his or her insight on the industry and relationship with the clients cmo creative brand planning media and other disciplines can and should be elevated in importance but this cannot be at the expense of account managements ability to lead so take a look at your account team and ask if your agency is assisting in the growth and development of bright empowered account leaders because when it comes to the value account management can bring to your client relationships there should be

contact us corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe
