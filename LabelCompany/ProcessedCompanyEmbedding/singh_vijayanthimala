scripturesedit she as a veil down to the slender waist her unadorned golden tresses wore dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved as the vine curls her tendrils – john miltons description of eve in paradise lost in the old testament the nazirites would go for long periods of time without cutting their hair to show devotion to god samson is one example his strength depended upon his refraining from cutting his hair described as worn in seven locks in the new testament saint paul formerly saul of tarsus wrote doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering but if any seem contentious we have no such custom neither do the churches of god an interpretation from observing nature the male animals such as the lion have the longer hair than the female thus it is not a shame for a man to have long hair western cultureedit ancient greece and romeedit in ancient greece long male hair was a symbol of wealth and power while a shaven head was appropriate for a slave the ancient greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long including zeus achilles apollo and poseidon greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off also in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle they were known to cut the front short but leave it long in the back where it was more out of reach a widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies reach the ponytail method allowed warriors who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice around the sixth century however the greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles with the exception of the spartans women in the culture remained with the longer style which for them showed freedom health and wealth as well as good behavior in men it was considered a sign of false pride by this time pliny the elder in his natural history and varro related that the romans did not begin to cut their hair short until barbers were introduced to italy from sicily by p ticinius mena in  bc women in roman times valued long hair usually with a center part apart from in the earliest times mens hair was usually shorter than womens although other cultures of the time such as greeks in the east considered long hair to be typical of philosophers who were thought to be too engrossed in learning to bother with hair strictly in the province of rome however the shorter hairstyle was especially popular when julius caesar conquered the gauls who favored long hair he ordered it to be cut short middle agesedit in the european middle ages shorter hair often signified servitude and peasantry while long hair was often attributed to freemen as was the case with the germanic goths and merovingians the gaelic irish both men and women took great pride in their long hair—for example a person could be heavily fined for cutting a mans hair short against his will when the anglonormans and the english colonized ireland hair length came to signify ones allegiance irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their irish heritage likewise english colonists who wore their hair long in the back were deemed to be forsaking their role as english subjects and giving in to the irish life thus hair length was one of the most common ways of judging a true englishman in this period muslims in christian areas were ordered to keep their hair short and parted as their longer style was considered rebellious and barbaric empress elisabeth of austria wearing thighlength hair in  painting by franz xaver winterhalter the long hair tradition was widespread among english and french men in the th and th centuries though it was considered mostly because of endorsement of the roman catholic church acceptable for men also to have shorter hair the tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle causing the people to follow wulfstan a religious leader worried that those with longer hair would fight like women and be unable to protect england from foreign invasion this idea can be found in later military leaders as well such as those of the american confederacy knights and rulers would also sometimes cut or pull out their hair in order to show penitence and mourning and a squires hair was generally shorter than a knights married women who let their hair flow out in public were frowned upon as this was normally reserved for the unwed although they were allowed to let it out in mourning to show their distressed state through these centuries it was expected of eastern christians to wear long hair as well as long beards which was especially expected from clergy and monks in england during the english civil wars of  to  male hair length was emblematic of the disputes between cavaliers and roundheads puritans cavaliers wore longer hair and were less religiousminded thought of by the roundheads as lecherous the more devout roundheads typically had somewhat shorter hair around this time long hair in england also came to be associated with adventurers who traveled to america and were familiar with the native culture there short hair with less adventurous types recent trends among womenedit the seven sutherland sisters were singing and showing off their famous floorlength hair in a sideshow of barnum  baileys from about  to  opera singer mary garden in  with kneelength hair indonesian woman with waistlength hair dutch woman with thighlength hair ngbandi girls with hiplength hair growing and wearing long hair was common among women in the western world until world war one long female hair never ceased in western culture though it was rare during the s and s and was frequent especially around  and citation needed in most current cultures it is more typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so an american study shows significant correlation between hair length and age which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women a significant correlation was also found between womens hair length and hair quality moreover hair quality was correlated with the womens perceived physical health consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology these results indicate that hair length and quality can act as a cue to a womans youth and health signifying reproductive potential the correlation between the womans hair length and marital status or number of children was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age recent trends among menedit long male hair in western youth culture became popular in the s and s with the beatles bob marley made rastafari culture and dreadlocks popular also outside jamaica before world war one men generally had longer hair and beards however short hair on men was introduced in world war one for soldiers slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads the trench warfare in  to  exposed men to flea and lice infestations which prompted the order to cut short hair establishing a military tradition and it expanded among civils by imitation beat poets during the s wore longer hairstyles by  a small beatnik community in newquay cornwall england including a young wizz jones had attracted the attention of their neighbors for growing their hair to a length past the shoulders resulting in a television interview with alan whicker on bbc televisions tonight series the s also introduced the beatles who started a more widespread longer hair trend the social revolution of the s led to a renaissance of unchecked hair growth and long hair especially on men was worn as a political or countercultural symbol or protest and as a symbol of masculinity this cultural symbol extended to several western countries in the americas western europe south africa and australia specific long hairstyles such as dreadlocks have been part of counterculture movements seeking to define other alternative cultures and lifestyles since this time longer hair in general remained popular due to the youth rebellion throughout the liberal decade of the s the long hair trend grew with the spread of the hippie movement in the s and in the s longer hair styles would become the norm among men and women in the s the popularity of jamaicas reggae music and musician bob marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally the antiestablishment philosophy of rastafari echoed in much of the reggae of the time resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among african americans and other blacks but among counterculture whites as well eastern christians are encouragedby whom to wear long hair with long beard in the s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or countercultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged thencontemporary views of tradition in the s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts for example musicians in metal bands and their fans often wear long hair long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization such as locks of love for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate today long hair has gained even more popularity even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back this could in part be due to the man bun trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer hair back into a topknot bun hairstyle african americansedit when african slaves were freed in america they struggled to reach the social status of whites many former slaves tried to conform their hairstyles as part of this struggle women especially felt pressure to make their hair long and oily rather than keeping the shorter tightly coiled style they had known however during the civil rights movement of the s and s africanamericans such as malcolm x advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks in order to embrace their race and to return to west african roots social pressures at the time were heavily influencing these americans women to have long straight hair like white people did this resulted in the black is beautiful movement wherein african americans wore long hair that was however untreated and unmodified more recently hairextensions have become widespread scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have long smooth hair amelia jones points out that dolls for children such as barbies add to this pressure citing as an example a new black barbie with long hair blacks she believes should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to tame their hair contemporary north americaedit  it was estimated that  of american women wore shoulder length hair or longer  of women in ages  to  meaning slightly more than  of men and women altogether similar frequency was found in  when it was estimated that about  of the us adult population male as well as females has hair shoulderlength or longer about  have hair reaching to the bottom of the shoulder blades or longer about  have hair waist length or

estimated to be  million those with waistlength hair roughly  those with buttockslength hair to be  with knee length hair to  and with ankle length hair to  middle eastedit judaismedit strict orthodox judaism forbids men from cutting their sidelocks but other hair may be kept as desired hair is not cut during a time of mourning the torah in deuteronomy  prohibits removing hair in mourning for the dead islamedit transjordanian bedouin with shoulder length hair during world war ii in the muslim world it seems the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men in the past bedouin muslims often wore their hair in long braids but influences from the western world have caused a change in attitudes bedouins are now less likely to have long hair islamic countries in north africa such as egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the egyptian police viewed it as satanic and a sign of an infidel spanish rulers during the medieval period suspected longhaired males to be moors or moriscos therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a moorish custom however modern north african men have adopted western short hair muslims regard the prophet muhammad as the best example to live by and try to emulate him whenever possible the islamic prophet muhammad reportedly in sahih muslim had hair that hung over his shoulders and earlobes sahih bukhari regarded the most authentic of hadith also supports this using a prime example of the prophet isa jesus the prophet muhammad has also described jesus as having long hair reaching his ear lobes maliks muwatta  reported yahya related to me from malik from yahya ibn said that abu qatada alansari said to the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace i have a lot of hair which comes down to my shoulders shall i comb it the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said yes and honour it sometimes abu qatada oiled it twice in one day because the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said to him honour it with regards to women neither quran nor sunnah explicitly state that women cannot cut their hair hadith does mention that women should not imitate men and vice versa and hence many scholars on this assumption decree that women should let their hair grow longer than the hair of the prophet reaching beyond their shoulders as hadith mentions that the prophet had his hair between his shoulder and his earlobes he described jesuss hair which hung to his earlobes as long however according to some hadiths regarding the rules of awrah women are required to grow hair long long enough that it would cover the breasts or as much awrah parts of the body when theyre being buried because she lacks clothes and long hair would be used as a covering instead some muslims are also opposed to men having long hair as it is also important in islam to have clear differences in appearance between sexes and generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair the taliban in afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the prophet similar measures have been taken by islamists in iraq in spite of this several taliban affiliated members of the mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair the saudi islamist fighter amir khattab was also notable for his long hair dervishes of some sufi orders such as the kasnazani often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals native americansedit yakima boy with midback level hair photo by edward s curtis – many native american men wore long hair before the arrival of western influences on their culture in cherokee legends for example males said to be handsome were often described as having long hair almost to the ground or similar formulas both men and women of these cultures have frequently struggled to maintain their tradition but have faced heavy opposition many consider it a sign of giving in to western influences to have their hair cut early american settlers saw longhaired native men as rebelling against their civilized society mountain men and trappers who adopted the customs were also considered amoral and often identified by their long hair since the cultural movements of the sixties and seventies however native americans have felt less pressure to have short hair as different movements have defended their cultural rights for example several states have loosened prison regulations allowing native americans to wear long hair during incarceration along with other cultural allowances there has been resistance to these changes however as long hair is sometimes used to hide drugs as well as to identify with a gang africaedit somali woman with shoulderlength hair throughout much of africa afrotextured hair is the most frequent hair form except among the afroasiatic hamitosemitic speaking populations in north africa and the horn of africa in the latter regions naturally long hair is instead more common in west african cultures women with long hair were highly

the tale of genji painted by tosa mitsuoki – chinese orthodox christian man from  nosu girls in china  a hindoo fakir or sadhu with long hair lithograph  by emily eden after lowes cato dickinson chinaedit in ancient china and korea hair was regarded as a precious legacy from parents most people would never cut their hair after they became adults and cutting off ones hair was a penalty for minor crimes both men and women would coil up their hair and many haircoiling styles were developed beginning in  the ethnic manchu qing dynasty forced all men in china to adopt the queue a long braid down the back with the hair near the forehead completely shaved hair length and style became a lifeordeath matter in  as the manchu told them either their hair or their head would be cut by  the population of china had been reduced from  million to just  million as a whole generation resisted the order for the sake of confucian ideals against shaving or harming their hair nearly every han rebel group began by shearing this pigtail most especially in the case of the taiping who were known in chinese as the longhairs but the queue on penalty of death lasted until  when the chinese people cut their queues in unison at a time of rebellion americans at first judged chinese immigrant laborers to be poor workers because their long hair brought an association with women islamic and christian missionaries among the chinese were strong advocates of shorter male hair for their converts around the destruction of four olds period in  almost anything seen as part of traditional chinese culture would lead to problems with the communist red guards items that attracted dangerous attention if caught in the public included jewelry and long male hair these things were regarded as symbols of bourgeois lifestyle that represented wealth people had to avoid them or suffer serious consequences such as tortures and beatings by the guards more recently long hair was ridiculed in china from october  to december  as part of the short and unsuccessful antispiritual pollution campaign also in chinese ancient and modern poetry long hair is a common symbol used by poets for example li bai and li shangyin to express their depression and sadness southeast asiaedit in southeast asia and indonesia male long hair was valued in until the seventeenth century when the area adopted outside influences including islam and christianity invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men as a sign of servitude as well they were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas such as thailand and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair they came up with several mythical stories one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and in a rage demanded that all women keep their hair short in rural areas in certain asian countries for example india girls still usually let their hair grow long and kneelength hair is not unusual japanedit in the medieval japan heian gentleman were not very interested in a womans physical beauty and rarely had an opportunity to see it the only physical attribute of interest was a womans hair which had to be thick and longer than she was tall the fascination with long hair was one reason why a womans becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness — it could never again grow to its full length this explains why genji refuses to let murasaki his de facto wife in the classical japanese novel the tale of genji take the tonsure when she is ill sikhismedit for sikhs kesh is

vyjayanthimala barely  illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty moving around daintily from one song to the otherthe closeup shots of vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effortnagin was a precursor to her rise in hindi cinema as an iconic actor who combined her talents performing and dancing to rule the screen on her termsbiggest recall values of nagin are

to accept the role the role was later offered to bina rai and suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of paro which was earlier offered to meena kumari subsequently

nabendu ghosh the script writer of devdas said that i did not approve of vyjayanthimala as chandramukhi but we had no option – no one wanted to play chandramukhi and we were committed to our distributorsshe was of course a very good actress but she was too young for chandramukhi as envisioned by saratbabu on her performance rediff wrote vyjayanthimala imbues chandramukhi with true sympathy who better than chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless lovevyjayanthimala a star after the blockbuster nagin still had to establish her acting credentials when roy went against the

in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman who in love with devdas has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman for vyjayantimala the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema – her dance subsequently she won filmfare award for best supporting actress but refused to accept it stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by suchitra sen and

woman with midback level hair humans horses and orangutans are among the few species that may grow their head hair very long humans are believed to have lost their fur – million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna as an effect of natural selection since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated an exception was however head hair which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun to protect against ultraviolet radiation exposure and also to provide cooling when sweat evaporates from soaked haircitation needed the ability to grow straight hair has been observed among homo sapiens subgroups in less sunny regions further away from the equator relative to kinky afrotextured hair straight hair allows more uv light to pass to the scalp which is essential for the production of vitamin d that is important for bone development scientists also view the ability to grow very long hair as a result of sexual selection since long and healthy hair is a sign of fertility and youthneed quotation to verify an evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health signifying a womans reproductive potential as hair grows slowly long hair may reveal – years of a persons health status nutrition age and reproductive fitness malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color eg dark hair turning reddish psychological significanceedit anthropologists speculate that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment a byproduct of secondary natural selection once other androgenicsomatic hair body hair had largely been lost another possibility is that long head hair is a result of fisherian runaway sexual selection where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual for some groups or individuals however short hair is the selected trait by seven to nine months infants can tell the sexes apart based on hair length voice pitch and faces cultural meaningedit ways of life often viewed as more rigid such as soldiers and religious cultures frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length for example buddhist monks shave their heads as part of their order of worship similarly religious men with long hair include the nazarites of the hebrew bible samson being a famous example and the sikhs subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length as was the case with the gaelic irish under english rule and the moors under spanish rule in medieval spainclarification needed east asian cultures have traditionally seen long unkempt hair in a woman as a sign of sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter as usually their hair is tied up in styles such as the ponytail plait or any bun transferred meaningedit the

given time about  of hair strands are in anagen the fibroblast growth factor  fgf gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans blocking fgf in the human scalp by applying a herbal extract that blocked fgf extends the hair cycle resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth cultural historyedit in jewish and christian scripturesedit she as a veil down to the slender waist her unadorned golden tresses wore dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved as the vine curls her tendrils – john miltons description of eve in paradise lost in the old testament the nazirites would go for long periods of time without cutting their hair to show devotion to god samson is one example his strength depended upon his refraining from cutting his hair described as worn in seven locks in the new testament saint paul formerly saul of tarsus wrote doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering but if any seem contentious we have no such custom neither do the churches of god an interpretation from observing nature the male animals such as the lion have the longer hair than the female thus it is not a shame for a man to have long hair western cultureedit ancient greece and romeedit in ancient greece long male hair was a symbol of wealth and power while a shaven head was appropriate for a slave the ancient greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long including zeus achilles apollo and poseidon greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off also in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle they were known to cut the front short but leave it long in the back where it was more out of reach a widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies reach the ponytail method allowed warriors who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice around the sixth century however the greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles with the exception of the spartans women in the culture remained with the longer style which for them showed freedom health and wealth as well as good behavior in men it was considered a sign of false pride by this time pliny the elder in his natural history and varro related that the romans did not begin to cut their hair short until barbers were introduced to italy from sicily by p ticinius mena in  bc women in roman times valued long hair usually with a center part apart from in the earliest times mens hair was usually shorter than womens although other cultures of the time such as greeks in the east considered long hair to be typical of philosophers who were thought to be too engrossed in learning to bother with hair strictly in the province of rome however the shorter hairstyle was especially popular when julius caesar conquered the gauls who favored long hair he ordered it to be cut short middle agesedit in the european middle ages shorter hair often signified servitude and peasantry while long hair was often attributed to freemen as was the case with the germanic goths and merovingians the gaelic irish both men and women took great pride in their long hair—for example a person could be heavily fined for cutting a mans hair short against his will when the anglonormans and the english colonized ireland hair length came to signify ones allegiance irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their irish heritage likewise english colonists who wore their hair long in the back were deemed to be forsaking their role as english subjects and giving in to the irish life thus hair length was one of the most common ways of judging a true englishman in this period muslims in christian areas were ordered to keep their hair short and parted as their longer style was considered rebellious and barbaric empress elisabeth of austria wearing thighlength hair in  painting by franz xaver winterhalter the long hair tradition was widespread among english and french men in the th and th centuries though it was considered mostly because of endorsement of the roman catholic church acceptable for men also to have shorter hair the tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle causing the people to follow wulfstan a religious leader worried that those with longer hair would fight like women and be unable to protect england from foreign invasion this idea can be found in later military leaders as well such as those of the american confederacy knights and rulers would also sometimes cut or pull out their hair in order to show penitence and mourning and a squires hair was generally shorter than a knights married women who let their hair flow out in public were frowned upon as this was normally reserved for the unwed although they were allowed to let it out in mourning to show their distressed state through these centuries it was expected of eastern christians to wear long hair as well as long beards which was especially expected from clergy and monks in england during the english civil wars of  to  male hair length was emblematic of the disputes between cavaliers and roundheads puritans cavaliers wore longer hair and were less religiousminded thought of by the roundheads as lecherous the more devout roundheads typically had somewhat shorter hair around this time long hair in england also came to be associated with adventurers who traveled to america and were familiar with the native culture there short hair with less adventurous types recent trends among womenedit the seven sutherland sisters were singing and showing off their famous floorlength hair in a sideshow of barnum  baileys from about  to  opera singer mary garden in  with kneelength hair indonesian woman with waistlength hair dutch woman with thighlength hair ngbandi girls with hiplength hair growing and wearing long hair was common among women in the western world until world war one long female hair never ceased in western culture though it was rare during the s and s and was frequent especially around  and citation needed in most current cultures it is more typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so an american study shows significant correlation between hair length and age which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women a significant correlation was also found between womens hair length and hair quality moreover hair quality was correlated with the womens perceived physical health consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology these results indicate that hair length and quality can act as a cue to a womans youth and health signifying reproductive potential the correlation between the womans hair length and marital status or number of children was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age recent trends among menedit long male hair in western youth culture became popular in the s and s with the beatles bob marley made rastafari culture and dreadlocks popular also outside jamaica before world war one men generally had longer hair and beards however short hair on men was introduced in world war one for soldiers slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads the trench warfare in  to  exposed men to flea and lice infestations which prompted the order to cut short hair establishing a military tradition and it expanded among civils by imitation beat poets during the s wore longer hairstyles by  a small beatnik community in newquay cornwall england including a young wizz jones had attracted the attention of their neighbors for growing their hair to a length past the shoulders resulting in a television interview with alan whicker on bbc televisions tonight series the s also introduced the beatles who started a more widespread longer hair trend the social revolution of the s led to a renaissance of unchecked hair growth and long hair especially on men was worn as a political or countercultural symbol or protest and as a symbol of masculinity this cultural symbol extended to several western countries in the americas western europe south africa and australia specific long hairstyles such as dreadlocks have been part of counterculture movements seeking to define other alternative cultures and lifestyles since this time longer hair in general remained popular due to the youth rebellion throughout the liberal decade of the s the long hair trend grew with the spread of the hippie movement in the s and in the s longer hair styles would become the norm among men and women in the s the popularity of jamaicas reggae music and musician bob marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally the antiestablishment philosophy of rastafari echoed in much of the reggae of the time resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among african americans and other blacks but among counterculture whites as well eastern christians are encouragedby whom to wear long hair with long beard in the s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or countercultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged thencontemporary views of tradition in the s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts for example musicians in metal bands and their fans often wear long hair long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization such as locks of love for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate today long hair has gained even more popularity even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back this could in part be due to the man bun trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer hair back into a topknot bun hairstyle african americansedit when african slaves were freed in america they struggled to reach the social status of whites many former slaves tried to conform their hairstyles as part of this struggle women especially felt pressure to make their hair long and oily rather than keeping the shorter tightly coiled style they had known however during the civil rights movement of the s and s africanamericans such as malcolm x advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks in order to embrace their race and to return to west african roots social pressures at the time were heavily influencing these americans women to have long straight hair like white people did this resulted in the black is beautiful movement wherein african americans wore long hair that was however untreated and unmodified more recently hairextensions have become widespread scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have long smooth hair amelia jones points out that dolls for children such as barbies add to this pressure citing as an example a new black barbie with long hair blacks she believes should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to tame their hair contemporary north americaedit  it was estimated that  of american women wore shoulder length hair or longer  of women in ages  to  meaning slightly more than  of men and women altogether similar frequency was found in  when it was estimated that about  of the us adult population male as well as females has hair shoulderlength or longer about  have hair reaching to the bottom of the shoulder blades or longer about  have hair waist length or longer and only about  have hair buttockslength or longer by extrapolating the above data and the number of hair length records the number of people with shoulderlength hair or longer in the usa is estimated to be  million those with waistlength hair roughly  those with buttockslength hair to be  with knee length hair to  and with ankle length hair to  middle eastedit judaismedit strict orthodox judaism forbids men from cutting their sidelocks but other hair may be kept as desired hair is not cut during a time of mourning the torah in deuteronomy  prohibits removing hair in mourning for the dead islamedit transjordanian bedouin with shoulder length hair during world war ii in the muslim world it seems the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men in the past bedouin muslims often wore their hair in long braids but influences from the western world have caused a change in attitudes bedouins are now less likely to have long hair islamic countries in north africa such as egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the egyptian police viewed it as satanic and a sign of an infidel spanish rulers during the medieval period suspected longhaired males to be moors or moriscos therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a moorish custom however modern north african men have adopted western short hair muslims regard the prophet muhammad as the best example to live by and try to emulate him whenever possible the islamic prophet muhammad reportedly in sahih muslim had hair that hung over his shoulders and earlobes sahih bukhari regarded the most authentic of hadith also supports this using a prime example of the prophet isa jesus the prophet muhammad has also described jesus as having long hair reaching his ear lobes maliks muwatta  reported yahya related to me from malik from yahya ibn said that abu qatada alansari said to the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace i have a lot of hair which comes down to my shoulders shall i comb it the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said yes and honour it sometimes abu qatada oiled it twice in one day because the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said to him honour it with regards to women neither quran nor sunnah explicitly state that women cannot cut their hair hadith does mention that women should not imitate men and vice versa and hence many scholars on this assumption decree that women should let their hair grow longer than the hair of the prophet reaching beyond their shoulders as hadith mentions that the prophet had his hair between his shoulder and his earlobes he described jesuss hair which hung to his earlobes as long however according to some hadiths regarding the rules of awrah women are required to grow hair long long enough that it would cover the breasts or as much awrah parts of the body when theyre being buried because she lacks clothes and long hair would be used as a covering instead some muslims are also opposed to men having long hair as it is also important in islam to have clear differences in appearance between sexes and generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair the taliban in afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the prophet similar measures have been taken by islamists in iraq in spite of this several taliban affiliated members of the mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair the saudi islamist fighter amir khattab was also notable for his long hair dervishes of some sufi orders such as the kasnazani often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals native americansedit yakima boy with midback level hair photo by edward s curtis – many native american men wore long hair before the arrival of western influences on their culture in cherokee legends for example males said to be handsome were often described as having long hair almost to the ground or similar formulas both men and women of these cultures have frequently struggled to maintain their tradition but have faced heavy opposition many consider it a sign of giving in to western influences to have their hair cut early american settlers saw longhaired native men as rebelling against their civilized society mountain men and trappers who adopted the customs were also considered amoral and often identified by their long hair since the cultural movements of the sixties and seventies however native americans have felt less pressure to have short hair as different movements have defended their cultural rights for example several states have loosened prison regulations allowing native americans to wear long hair during incarceration along with other cultural allowances there has been resistance to these changes however as long hair is sometimes used to hide drugs as well as to identify with a gang africaedit somali woman with shoulderlength hair throughout much of africa afrotextured hair is the most frequent hair form except among the afroasiatic hamitosemitic speaking populations in north africa and the horn of africa in the latter regions naturally long hair is instead more common in west african cultures women with long hair were highly valued long thick hair was seen as a sign of health strength and capability to bear many children in keeping with this general theme women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so this tradition however did not extend to every west african culture as several valued shorter hair asiaedit historically east asian cultures viewed long hair as a sign of youth and aesthetic beauty long hair is associated with private life and sexuality east asian cultures see long unkempt hair in a woman as a sign of sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter as usually their hair is tied up lay buddhists have long hair while buddhist monks have shaved heads japanese woman combing her long hair colour woodblock print from  by hashiguchi goyō illustration of the tale of genji painted by tosa mitsuoki – chinese orthodox christian man from  nosu girls in china  a hindoo fakir or sadhu with long hair lithograph  by emily eden after lowes cato dickinson chinaedit in ancient china and korea hair was regarded as a precious legacy from parents most people would never cut their hair after they became adults and cutting off ones hair was a penalty for minor crimes both men and women would coil up their hair and many haircoiling styles were developed beginning in  the ethnic manchu qing dynasty forced all men in china to adopt the queue a long braid down the back with the hair near the forehead completely shaved hair length and style became a lifeordeath matter in  as the manchu told them either their hair or their head would be cut by  the population of china had been reduced from  million to just  million as a whole generation resisted the order for the sake of confucian ideals against shaving or harming their hair nearly every han rebel group began by shearing this pigtail most especially in the case of the taiping who were known in chinese as the longhairs but the queue on penalty of death lasted until  when the chinese people cut their queues in unison at a time of rebellion americans at first judged chinese immigrant laborers to be poor workers because their long hair brought an association with women islamic and christian missionaries among the chinese were strong advocates of shorter male hair for their converts around the destruction of four olds period in  almost anything seen as part of traditional chinese culture would lead to problems with the communist red guards items that attracted dangerous attention if caught in the public included jewelry and long male hair these things were regarded as symbols of bourgeois lifestyle that represented wealth people had to avoid them or suffer serious consequences such as tortures and beatings by the guards more recently long hair was ridiculed in china from october  to december  as part of the short and unsuccessful antispiritual pollution campaign also in chinese ancient and modern poetry long hair is a common symbol used by poets for example li bai and li shangyin to express their depression and sadness southeast asiaedit in southeast asia and indonesia male long hair was valued in until the seventeenth century when the area adopted outside influences including islam and christianity invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men as a sign of servitude as well they were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas such as thailand and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair they came up with several mythical stories one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and in a rage demanded that all women keep their hair short in rural areas in certain asian countries for example india girls still usually let their hair grow long and kneelength hair is not unusual japanedit in the medieval japan heian gentleman were not very interested in a womans physical beauty and rarely had an opportunity to see it the only physical attribute of interest was a womans hair which had to be thick and longer than she was tall the fascination with long hair was one reason why a womans becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness — it could never again grow to its full length this explains why genji refuses to let murasaki his de facto wife in the classical japanese novel the tale of genji take the tonsure when she is ill sikhismedit for sikhs kesh is the practice of allowing ones hair to grow naturally as a symbol of devotion to god and lack of worldliness this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august  learn how and when to remove this template message the sikhs were commanded by guru gobind singh at the baisakhi amrit sanchar in  to wear long uncut hair called kesh at all times to signify the strength and vitality of the sikh people this was one of the five requisites of faith collectively called kakars that form the external visible identifiers to clearly affirm a sikhs commitment and dedication to the order hukam of the tenth master and made one a member of the khalsa the khalsa is the saintsoldier of guru gobind singh who stated the following he does not recognize anyone else except one lord not even the bestowal of charities performance of merciful acts austerities and restraint on pilgrimstations the perfect light of the lord illuminates his heart then consider him as the immaculate khalsa guru gobind singh in the dasam granth page  the kesh or unshorn long hair is an indispensable part of the human body as created by waheguru that is the mainstay of the jivan jaach and the rehni that was prescribed by guru gobind singh sahib by which a sikh is clearly and quickly identified kesh the kanga another requisite of faith is usually tucked behind the rishi knot and tied under the turban the uncut long head hair and the beard in the case of men forms the main kakar for the sikhs kesadhari a term defining a sikh as one who carries on his head the full growth of his kes hair which he never trims or cuts for any reason anyone sikh or nonsikh may keep the hair unshorn but for the sikh kes unshorn hair is a requisite of faith and an inviolable vow the sikh rahit maryada published by the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee statutory body for the control and management of sikh shrines and by extension for laying down rules about sikh beliefs and practices issued in

illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty moving around daintily from one song to the otherthe closeup shots of vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effortnagin was a precursor to her rise in hindi cinema as an iconic actor who combined her talents performing and dancing to rule the screen on her termsbiggest recall values of nagin are vyjayanthimala post nagin vyjayanthimala had established herself as one of the leading actresses in bollywood because of the films nationwide success hemant kumars music and her dance on the song man dole mera tan dole

kumar in the critically acclaimed devdas which was the adaptation of the novel with same title by sharat chandra chatterji the industry initially was not in favour of this choice when they heard about vyjayanthimala being cast in bimal roys film the response being why dont you take comedian kishore kumar as devdas initially nargis was selected for chandramukhis role but she refused to accept the role the role was later offered to bina rai and suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of paro which was earlier offered to meena kumari subsequently the film unit suffered with financial crisis and at this point vyjayanthimala offered to do the role of chandramukhi where she said to bimal roy i am ready if you think i can do it on the other hand nabendu ghosh the script writer of devdas said that i did not approve of vyjayanthimala as chandramukhi but we had no option – no one wanted to play chandramukhi and we were committed to our distributorsshe was of course a very good actress but she was too young for chandramukhi as envisioned by saratbabu on her performance rediff wrote vyjayanthimala imbues chandramukhi with true sympathy who better than chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless lovevyjayanthimala a star after the blockbuster nagin still had to establish her acting credentials when roy went against the tide and cast her in the role of chandramukhi while upperstallcom describes her performance as vyjayantimalas chandramukhi is embellished with her graceful dance style that evolves with the evolution in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman who in love with devdas has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman for vyjayantimala the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema – her dance subsequently she won filmfare award for best supporting actress but refused to accept it stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by suchitra sen and not supporting in  a poll

supporting role as a vamp which was originally done by lalitha in the tamil version however according to upperstallcom her role was very crucial in the film and her portrayal as the naag rani accompanied by her dance is the main attraction of the film also starring in the movie reprising their lead roles from the original were gemini ganesan and anjali devi meanwhile she was signed by sohrab modi for his film rajhath opposite pradeep kumar however due to her schedule problem she was replaced by madhubala vyjayanthimala then acted with kishore kumar again in the comedy film new

always had the mandatory dance sequence in practically every film of hers evoking classical art associations she excels in the two main dances in new delhi — the solo bharatnatayam aliruppu number and the bhangra folk dance in her punjabi avtaar and she is absolutely brilliant in the bhangra folk dancein her second avtar even vyjayanthimala played a punjabi girl and most successfully too

days of initial shooting at mumbai the director wanted the unit to travel to bhopal for an extended outdoor shooting however ataullah khan the father of madhubala objected to this and the role went to

stream and risks her life to save the bridgewonderful scene between two stars whose chemistry is undeniable while reviewer taran adarsh from bollywood hungama mentions that commendable performances come in from vyjayantimala naturalthe relationships dilip kumarvyjayantimala are so human and believable at the end of its theatrical run the film had collected around ₹  thus becoming the second

with rajendra kumar and pradeep kumar which was produced by the latter with his home production company deep  pradeep productions she returned to the screen again with kishore kumar in the  partially colourmade film aasha which became a hit at the box office the story revolves around the central character kishore played by kishore kumar who despite being a zamindaar believes in helping the needy

both the protagonists trying to prove kishores innocence the movie is best known for its song eena meena dekha sung by kishore kumar and asha bhosle in two different versions aasha also introduced actress asha parekh to the silver screen in a song alongside vyjayanthimala whom parekh described as her matinee idol the following year proved to be very successful for vyjayanthimala where she signed opposite dilip kumar in bimal roys madhumati in the title role originally supposed to essay four roles the director finally scaled it down to three madhumati madhavi and radha the film was

tripped on a stone and fell while hurting herself badly causing damage to her fibre tissues in the sole of her foot roy who was terrified and in a quandary over the incident as the shooting could not be stopped insisted on her wearing sandals which made it difficult for her during running sequences even after the completion of madhumati she still encountered the pain from the injury which always reminded her of madhumatis shooting experience written by ritwik ghatak the film is about devendra played by dilip kumar who takes shelter during a storm in an abandoned house here he discovers a painting of the owner of the house raja ugranarayan painted by him in his previous life when was anand also played by dilip kumar and worked as a foreman on a plantation of raja ugranarayan devendra

decade with its adjusted inflation net gross to about ₹ million her performance as madhavi radha and the ghost madhumati earned her accoladates from critics shahid khan from planetbollywoodcom said vyjayantimala has never been one of my most favourite actresses but this is one of the few performances where i am completely bowled over by her her expressions while playing both the main characters are perfect with madhumati she brings the wonder surprise and innocence needed in the person with madhavi she brings the poise the curiosity and pity for the grief that anand is going through and karan bali from upperstallcom wrote that for vyjayanthimala the film showcases both her acting as well as dancing abilities and the dizzying success of madhumati took vyjayanthimala to the highest rungs of stardomto cap off an extremely successful year for her both as an actress of considerable dramatic merit and as a star madhumati came to be known as the first film which dealt with the theme of reincarnation and had a gothic noir feel to it the film later inspired films such as milan  the reincarnation of peter proud  mehbooba  kudrat  karz  karan arjun  and particularly om shanti om  which had also lifted the films climax which led to rinki bhattacharya the late roys daughter accusing the film of plagiarism and threatening legal action against its producers the same month she had another release b r chopras sadhna alongside sunil dutt vyjayanthimala was the second choice for the role of champabai the prostitute after actress nimmi who hesitated to play the role of a prostitute

dutt chopra who previously directed vyjayanthimala in naya daur had adapted the theme on the rehabilitation of prostitutes which was then a controversial topic in india along with the film her performance received universal acclaim as told by vijay lokapally from the hindu among the great movies made on the subject of helpless women versus society sadhna holds its own for its realistic portrayal and treatment of a subject so aesthetically documented by chopra and vyjayanthimala and praised the latter gorgeous when she entertains the clients at her kothastunningly restrained when she assumes the character of a prospective wife similarly the rediffs critic dinesh raheja has commented that but finally the show belongs to vyjayanthimala fetchingly frivolous in the first half she is suitably serious in the second she makes her need for acceptance palpable her eyes emit twin lasers of anger and condemnation at those that exploit women sadhna also performed well at the box office where it became fifth highestgrossing film of  with trade pundits declaring the film a boxoffice hit subsequently vyjayanthimala received two filmfare nominations in best actress category for madhumati and sadhna where she won her first ever filmfare trophy for the latter after refusing to accept the best supporting actress award trophy for devdas  earlier her next release was amar deep

similarly praised her portrayal the ethereal vyjayanthimala barely  illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty moving around daintily from one song to the otherthe closeup shots of vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effortnagin was a precursor to her rise in hindi cinema as an iconic actor who combined her talents performing and dancing to rule the screen on her termsbiggest recall values of nagin are vyjayanthimala post nagin vyjayanthimala had established herself as one of the leading actresses in bollywood because of the films nationwide success hemant

box office success vyjayanthimala debuted in kannada cinema through a film called asha nirasha which was produced by g d venkatram the film had lata mangeshkar asha bhosle and mohammed rafi as the

vyjayanthimala acted in  films in bollywood the first one was by director abdur rashid kardars yasmin alongside actor suresh which won the filmfare best cinematographer for dwarka divecha besides that she also starred in three other films namely pehli jhalak with kishore kumar sitara with pradeep kumar and jashan with karan dewan eventually all her four films released in  failed at box office the same year bimal roy cast her as chandramukhi opposite dilip kumar in the critically acclaimed devdas which was the adaptation of the novel with same title by sharat chandra chatterji the industry initially was not in favour of this choice when they heard about vyjayanthimala being cast in bimal roys film the response being why dont you take comedian kishore kumar as devdas initially nargis was selected for chandramukhis role but she refused to accept the role the role was later offered to bina rai and suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of paro which was earlier offered to meena kumari subsequently the film unit suffered with financial crisis and at this point vyjayanthimala offered to do the role of chandramukhi where she said to bimal roy i am ready if you think i can do it on the other hand nabendu ghosh the script writer of devdas said that i did not approve of vyjayanthimala as chandramukhi but we had no option – no one wanted to play chandramukhi and we were committed to our distributorsshe was of course a very good actress but she was too young for chandramukhi as envisioned by saratbabu on her performance rediff wrote vyjayanthimala imbues chandramukhi with true sympathy who better than chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless lovevyjayanthimala a star after the blockbuster nagin still had to establish her acting credentials when roy went against the tide and cast her in the role of chandramukhi while upperstallcom describes her performance as vyjayantimalas chandramukhi is embellished with her graceful dance style that evolves with the evolution in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman who in love with devdas has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman for vyjayantimala the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema – her dance subsequently she won filmfare award for best supporting actress but refused to accept it stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by suchitra sen and not supporting in  a poll conducted by rediff ranked her role of chandramukhi as one of the best tawaif character in bollywood subsequently the same role was listed in the times of indias  celluloid hookers you loved at number six by nikhat kazmi though the film was critically successful but it did not garner much support at the box office and

successful tamil film kanavaney kankanda deivam surprisingly though she accepted a supporting role as a vamp which was originally done by lalitha in the tamil version however according to

madhubala vyjayanthimala then acted with kishore kumar again in the comedy film new delhi which became the fifth highestgrossing film of  a boxoffice hit the film showcases a love that sprouts between a punjabi boy played kishore kumar and tamil girl played by vyjayanthimala her performance was applauded by fans and critics alike a review on upperstallcom regarding her performance in this movie states that vyjayanthimala proves to be the perfect foil for kishore kumarhas always had the mandatory dance sequence in practically every film of hers evoking classical art associations she excels in the two main dances in new delhi — the solo bharatnatayam aliruppu number and the bhangra folk dance in her punjabi avtaar and she is absolutely brilliant in the bhangra folk dancein her second avtar even vyjayanthimala played a punjabi girl and most successfully too subsequently she did a tamil film called marma veeran along with sriram rajasulochana m n rajam j p chandrababu and chittor v

beautiful as the belle of the hills her dancing too is very graceful specially in those eyefilling colour sequences and delightful ballets towards the finish while in the hindu review vijay lokapally similarly praised her portrayal the ethereal vyjayanthimala barely  illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty moving around daintily from one song to the otherthe closeup shots of vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effortnagin was a precursor to her rise in hindi cinema as an iconic actor who combined her talents performing and dancing to rule the screen on her termsbiggest recall values of nagin are vyjayanthimala post nagin vyjayanthimala had established herself as one of the leading actresses in bollywood because of the films nationwide success hemant kumars music and her dance on the song man dole mera tan dole rendered by lata mangeshkar was one of the highlights of the film in the same year she acted in miss mala with kishore kumar whichwas a box office success vyjayanthimala debuted in kannada cinema through a film called asha nirasha which was produced by g d venkatram the film had lata mangeshkar asha bhosle and mohammed rafi as the playback singers but the movie was unreleased though the producers son srikant venkatram claimed that the film was released and flopped miserably at box office which made the film obscure in  vyjayanthimala acted in  films in bollywood the first one was by director abdur rashid kardars yasmin alongside actor suresh which won the filmfare best cinematographer for dwarka divecha besides that she also starred in three other films namely pehli jhalak with kishore kumar sitara with pradeep kumar and jashan with karan dewan eventually all her four films released in  failed at box office the same year bimal roy cast her as chandramukhi opposite dilip kumar in the critically acclaimed devdas which was the adaptation of the novel with same title by sharat chandra chatterji the industry initially was not in favour of this choice when they heard about vyjayanthimala being cast in bimal roys film the response being why dont you take comedian kishore kumar as devdas initially nargis was selected for chandramukhis role but she refused to accept the role the role was later offered to bina rai and suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of paro which was earlier offered to meena kumari subsequently the film unit suffered with financial crisis and at this point vyjayanthimala offered to do the role of chandramukhi where she said to bimal roy i am ready if you think i can do it on the other hand nabendu ghosh the script writer of devdas said that i did not approve of vyjayanthimala as chandramukhi but we had no option – no one wanted to play chandramukhi and we were committed to our distributorsshe was of course a very good actress but she was too young for chandramukhi as envisioned by saratbabu on her performance rediff wrote vyjayanthimala imbues chandramukhi with true sympathy who better than chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless lovevyjayanthimala a star after the blockbuster nagin still had to establish her acting credentials when roy went against the tide and cast her in the role of chandramukhi while upperstallcom describes her performance as vyjayantimalas chandramukhi is embellished with her graceful dance style that evolves with the evolution in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman who in love with devdas has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman for vyjayantimala the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema – her dance subsequently she won filmfare award for best supporting actress but refused to accept it stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by suchitra sen and not supporting in  a poll conducted by rediff ranked her role of chandramukhi as one of the best tawaif character in bollywood subsequently the same role was listed in the times of indias  celluloid hookers you loved at number six by nikhat kazmi though the film was critically successful but it did not garner much support at the box office and ended up as th highestgrossing movie of  with an average verdict  after being recognised as a capable actress with devdas vyjayanthimala acted in successful movies in  namely taj patrani and anjaan somewhere in dehli  all three films with pradeep kumar as the hero and kismet ka khel with sunil dutt in the same year she also acted in swashbuckler film devta which was a remake of a hugely successful tamil film kanavaney kankanda deivam surprisingly though she accepted a supporting role as a vamp which was originally done by lalitha in the tamil version however according to upperstallcom her role was very crucial in the film and her portrayal as the naag rani accompanied by her dance is the main attraction of the film also starring in the movie reprising their lead roles from the original were gemini ganesan and anjali devi meanwhile she was signed by sohrab modi for his film rajhath opposite pradeep kumar however due to her schedule problem she was replaced by madhubala vyjayanthimala then acted with kishore kumar again in the comedy film new delhi which became the fifth highestgrossing film of  a boxoffice hit the film showcases a love that sprouts between a punjabi boy played kishore kumar and tamil girl played by vyjayanthimala her performance was applauded by fans and critics alike a review on upperstallcom regarding her performance in this movie states that vyjayanthimala proves to be the perfect foil for kishore kumarhas always had the mandatory dance sequence in practically every film of hers evoking classical art associations she excels in the two main dances in new delhi — the solo bharatnatayam aliruppu number and the bhangra folk dance in her punjabi avtaar and she is absolutely brilliant in the bhangra folk dancein her second avtar even vyjayanthimala played a punjabi girl and most successfully too subsequently she did a tamil film called marma veeran along with sriram rajasulochana m n rajam j p chandrababu and chittor v nagaiah the film had some of the south indian established actors such as n t rama rao sivaji ganesan and gemini ganesan in guest appearance – success and stardom in hindi filmsedit in  director b r

within cultures for example a woman with chinlength hair in some cultures may be said to have short hair while a man with the same length of hair in some of the same cultures would be said to have long hair males having short cut hair are in many cultures viewed as being under societys control such as while in the military or prison or as punishment for a crime although recently in the united states it has become more socially acceptable and more common for men to have hair reaching all the way down to their upper back long thick hair has been a sign of wealth power or prominence

woman with midback level hair humans horses and orangutans are among the few species that may grow their head hair very long humans are believed to have lost their fur – million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna as an effect of natural selection since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated an exception was however head hair which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun to protect against ultraviolet radiation exposure and also to provide cooling when sweat evaporates from soaked haircitation needed the ability to grow straight hair has been observed among homo sapiens subgroups in less sunny regions further away from the equator relative to kinky afrotextured hair straight hair allows more uv light to pass to the scalp which is essential for the production of vitamin d that is important for bone development scientists also view the ability to grow very long hair as a result of sexual selection since long and healthy hair is a sign of fertility and youthneed quotation to verify an evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health signifying a womans reproductive potential as hair grows slowly long hair may reveal – years of a persons health status nutrition age and reproductive fitness malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color eg dark hair turning reddish psychological significanceedit

lost another possibility is that long head hair is a result of fisherian runaway sexual selection where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual for some groups or individuals

rigid such as soldiers and religious cultures frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length for example buddhist monks shave their heads as part of their order of worship similarly religious men with long hair include the nazarites of the hebrew bible samson being a famous example and the sikhs subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length as was the case with the gaelic irish under english rule and the moors under spanish rule in medieval spainclarification needed east asian cultures have traditionally seen long unkempt hair in a woman as a sign of sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter as usually their hair is tied up in styles such as the ponytail plait or any bun transferred meaningedit the

unadorned golden tresses wore dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved as the vine curls her tendrils – john miltons description of eve in paradise lost in the old testament the nazirites would go for long periods of time without cutting their hair to show devotion to god samson is one example his strength depended upon his refraining from cutting his hair described as worn in seven locks in the new testament saint paul formerly saul of tarsus wrote doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering but if any seem contentious we have no such custom neither do the churches of god an interpretation from observing nature the male animals such as the lion have the longer hair than the female thus it is not a shame for a man to have long hair western cultureedit ancient greece and romeedit in ancient greece long male hair was a symbol of wealth and power while a shaven head was appropriate for a slave the ancient greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long including zeus achilles apollo and poseidon greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off also in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle they were known to cut the front short but leave it long in the back where it was more out of reach a widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies reach the ponytail method allowed warriors who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice around the sixth century however the greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles with the exception of the spartans women in the culture remained with the longer style which for them showed freedom health and wealth as well as good behavior in men it was considered a sign of false pride by this time pliny the elder in his natural history and varro related that the romans did not begin to cut their hair short until barbers were introduced to italy from sicily by p ticinius mena in  bc women in roman times valued long hair usually with a center part apart from in the earliest times mens hair was usually shorter than womens although other cultures of the time such as greeks in the east considered long hair to be typical of philosophers who were thought to be too engrossed in learning to bother with hair strictly in the province of rome however the shorter hairstyle was especially popular when julius caesar conquered the gauls who favored long hair he ordered it to be cut short middle agesedit in the european middle ages shorter hair often signified servitude and peasantry while long hair was often attributed to freemen as was the case with the germanic goths and merovingians the gaelic irish both men and women took great pride in their long hair—for example a person could be heavily fined for cutting a mans hair short against his will when the anglonormans and the english colonized ireland hair length came to signify ones allegiance irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their irish heritage likewise english colonists who wore their hair long in the back were deemed to be forsaking their role as english subjects and giving in to the irish life thus hair length was one of the most common ways of judging a true englishman in this period muslims in christian areas were ordered to keep their hair short and parted as their longer style was considered rebellious and barbaric empress elisabeth of austria wearing thighlength hair in  painting by franz xaver winterhalter the long hair tradition was widespread among english and french men in the th and th centuries though it was considered mostly because of endorsement of the roman catholic church acceptable for men also to have shorter hair the tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle causing the people to follow wulfstan a religious leader worried that those with longer hair would fight like women and be unable to protect england from foreign invasion this idea can be found in later military leaders as well such as those of the american confederacy knights and rulers would also sometimes cut or pull out their hair in order to show penitence and mourning and a squires hair was generally shorter than a knights married women who let their hair flow out in public were frowned upon as this was normally reserved for the unwed although they were allowed to let it out in mourning to show their distressed state through these centuries it was expected of eastern christians to wear long hair as well as long beards which was especially expected from clergy and monks in england during the english civil wars of  to  male hair length was emblematic of the disputes between cavaliers and roundheads puritans cavaliers wore longer hair and were less religiousminded thought of by the roundheads as lecherous the more devout roundheads typically had somewhat shorter hair around this time long hair in england also came to be associated with adventurers who traveled to america and were familiar with the native culture there short hair with less adventurous types recent trends among womenedit the seven sutherland sisters were singing and showing off their famous floorlength hair in a sideshow of barnum  baileys from about  to  opera singer mary garden in  with kneelength hair indonesian woman with waistlength hair dutch woman with thighlength hair ngbandi girls with hiplength hair growing and wearing long hair was common among women in the western world until world war one long female hair never ceased in western culture though it was rare during the s and s and was frequent especially around  and citation needed in most current cultures it is more typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so an american study shows significant correlation between hair length and age which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women a significant correlation was also found between womens hair length and hair quality moreover hair quality was correlated with the womens perceived physical health consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology these results indicate that hair length and quality can act as a cue to a womans youth and health signifying reproductive potential the correlation between the womans hair length and marital status or number of children was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age recent trends among menedit long male hair in western youth culture became popular in the s and s with the beatles bob marley made rastafari culture and dreadlocks popular also outside jamaica before world war one men generally had longer hair and beards however short hair on men was introduced in world war one for soldiers slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads the trench warfare in  to  exposed men to flea and lice infestations which prompted the order to cut short hair establishing a military tradition and it expanded among civils by imitation beat poets during the s wore longer hairstyles by  a small beatnik community in newquay cornwall england including a young wizz jones had attracted the attention of their neighbors for growing their hair to a length past the shoulders resulting in a television interview with alan whicker on bbc televisions tonight series the s also introduced the beatles who started a more widespread longer hair trend the social revolution of the s led to a renaissance of unchecked hair growth and long hair especially on men was worn as a political or countercultural symbol or protest and as a symbol of masculinity this cultural symbol extended to several western countries in the americas western europe south africa and australia specific long hairstyles such as dreadlocks have been part of counterculture movements seeking to define other alternative cultures and lifestyles since this time longer hair in general remained popular due to the youth rebellion throughout the liberal decade of the s the long hair trend grew with the spread of the hippie movement in the s and in the s longer hair styles would become the norm among men and women in the s the popularity of jamaicas reggae music and musician bob marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally the antiestablishment philosophy of rastafari echoed in much of the reggae of the time resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among african americans and other blacks but among counterculture whites as well eastern christians are encouragedby whom to wear long hair with long beard in the s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or countercultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged thencontemporary views of tradition in the s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts for example musicians in metal bands and their fans often wear long hair long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization such as locks of love for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate today long hair has gained even more popularity even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back this could in part be due to the man bun trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer hair back into a topknot bun hairstyle african americansedit when african slaves were freed in america they struggled to reach the social status of whites many former slaves tried to conform their hairstyles as part of this struggle women especially felt pressure to make their hair long and oily rather than keeping the shorter tightly coiled style they had known however during the civil rights movement of the s and s africanamericans such as malcolm x advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks in order to embrace their race and to return to west african roots social pressures at the time were heavily influencing these americans women to have long straight hair like white people did this resulted in the black is beautiful movement wherein african americans wore long hair that was however untreated and unmodified more recently hairextensions have become widespread scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have long smooth hair amelia jones points out that dolls for children such as barbies add to this pressure citing as an example a new black barbie with long hair blacks she believes should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to tame their hair contemporary north americaedit  it was estimated that  of american women wore shoulder length hair or longer  of women in ages  to  meaning slightly more than  of men and women altogether similar frequency was found in  when it was estimated that about  of the us adult population male as well as females has hair shoulderlength or longer about  have hair reaching to the bottom of the shoulder blades or longer about  have hair waist length or longer and only about  have hair buttockslength or longer by extrapolating the above data and the number of hair length records the number of people with shoulderlength hair or longer in the usa is estimated to be  million those with waistlength hair roughly  those with buttockslength hair to be  with knee length hair to  and with ankle length hair to  middle eastedit judaismedit strict orthodox judaism forbids men from cutting their sidelocks but other hair may be kept as desired hair is not cut during a time of mourning the torah in deuteronomy  prohibits removing hair in mourning for the dead islamedit transjordanian bedouin with shoulder length hair during world war ii in the muslim world it seems the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men in the past bedouin muslims often wore their hair in long braids but influences from the western world have caused a change in attitudes bedouins are now less likely to have long hair islamic countries in north africa such as egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the egyptian police viewed it as satanic and a sign of an infidel spanish rulers during the medieval period suspected longhaired males to be moors or moriscos therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a moorish custom however modern north african men have adopted western short hair muslims regard the prophet muhammad as the best example to live by and try to emulate him whenever possible the islamic prophet muhammad reportedly in sahih muslim had hair that hung over his shoulders and earlobes sahih bukhari regarded the most authentic of hadith also supports this using a prime example of the prophet isa jesus the prophet muhammad has also described jesus as having long hair reaching his ear lobes maliks muwatta  reported yahya related to me from malik from yahya ibn said that abu qatada alansari said to the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace i have a lot of hair which comes down to my shoulders shall i comb it the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said yes and honour it sometimes abu qatada oiled it twice in one day because the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said to him honour it with regards to women neither quran nor sunnah explicitly state that women cannot cut their hair hadith does mention that women should not imitate men and vice versa and hence many scholars on this assumption decree that women should let their hair grow longer than the hair of the prophet reaching beyond their shoulders as hadith mentions that the prophet had his hair between his shoulder and his earlobes he described jesuss hair which hung to his earlobes as long however according to some hadiths regarding the rules of awrah women are required to grow hair long long enough that it would cover the breasts or as much awrah parts of the body when theyre being buried because she lacks clothes and long hair would be used as a covering instead some muslims are also opposed to men having long hair as it is also important in islam to have clear differences in appearance between sexes and generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair the taliban in afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the prophet similar measures have been taken by islamists in iraq in spite of this several taliban affiliated members of the mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair the saudi islamist fighter amir khattab was also notable for his long hair dervishes of some sufi orders such as the kasnazani often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals native americansedit yakima boy with midback level hair photo by edward s curtis – many native american men wore long hair before the arrival of western influences on their culture in cherokee legends for example males said to be handsome were often described as having long hair almost to the ground or similar formulas both men and women of these cultures have frequently struggled to maintain their tradition but have faced heavy opposition many consider it a sign of giving in to western influences to have their hair cut early american settlers saw longhaired native men as rebelling against their civilized society mountain men and trappers who adopted the customs were also considered amoral and often identified by their long hair since the cultural movements of the sixties and seventies however native americans have felt less pressure to have short hair as different movements have defended their cultural rights for example several states have loosened prison regulations allowing native americans to wear long hair during incarceration along with other cultural allowances there has been resistance to these changes however as long hair is sometimes used to hide drugs as well as to identify with a gang africaedit somali woman with shoulderlength hair throughout much of africa afrotextured hair is the most frequent hair form except among the afroasiatic hamitosemitic speaking populations in north africa and the horn of africa in the latter regions naturally long hair is instead more common in west african cultures women with long hair were highly valued long thick hair was seen as a sign of health strength and capability to bear many children in keeping with this general theme women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so this tradition however did not extend to every west african culture as several valued shorter hair asiaedit historically east asian cultures viewed long hair as a sign of youth and aesthetic beauty long hair is associated with private life and sexuality east asian cultures see long unkempt hair in a woman as a sign of sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter as usually their hair is tied up lay buddhists have long hair while buddhist monks have shaved heads japanese woman combing her long hair colour woodblock print from  by hashiguchi goyō illustration of the tale of genji painted by tosa mitsuoki – chinese orthodox christian man from  nosu girls in china  a hindoo fakir or sadhu with long hair lithograph  by emily eden after lowes cato dickinson chinaedit in ancient china and korea hair was regarded as a precious legacy from parents most people would never cut their hair after they became adults and cutting off ones hair was a penalty for minor crimes both men and women would coil up their hair and many haircoiling styles were developed beginning in  the ethnic manchu qing dynasty forced all men in china to adopt the queue a long braid down the back with the hair near the forehead completely shaved hair length and style became a lifeordeath matter in  as the manchu told them either their hair or their head would be cut by  the population of china had been reduced from  million to just  million as a whole generation resisted the order for the sake of confucian ideals against shaving or harming their hair nearly every han rebel group began by shearing this pigtail most especially in the case of the taiping who were known in chinese as the longhairs but the queue on penalty of death lasted until  when the chinese people cut their queues in unison at a time of rebellion americans at first judged chinese immigrant laborers to be poor workers because their long hair brought an association with women islamic and christian missionaries among the chinese were strong advocates of shorter male hair for their converts around the destruction of four olds period in  almost anything seen as part of traditional chinese culture would lead to problems with the communist red guards items that attracted dangerous attention if caught in the public included jewelry and long male hair these things were regarded as symbols of bourgeois lifestyle that represented wealth people had to avoid them or suffer serious consequences such as tortures and beatings by the guards more recently long hair was ridiculed in china from october  to december  as part of the short and unsuccessful antispiritual pollution campaign also in chinese ancient and modern poetry long hair is a common symbol used by poets for example li bai and li shangyin to express their depression and sadness southeast asiaedit in southeast asia and indonesia male long hair was valued in until the seventeenth century when the area adopted outside influences including islam and christianity invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men as a sign of servitude as well they were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas such as thailand and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair they came up with several mythical stories one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and in a rage demanded that all women keep their hair short in rural areas in certain asian countries for example india girls still usually let their hair grow long and kneelength hair is not unusual japanedit in the medieval japan heian gentleman were not very interested in a womans physical beauty and rarely had an opportunity to see it the only physical attribute of interest was a womans hair which had to be thick and longer than she was tall the fascination with long hair was one reason why a womans becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness — it could never again grow to its full length this explains why genji refuses to let murasaki his de facto wife in the classical japanese novel the tale of genji take the tonsure when she is ill sikhismedit for sikhs kesh is the practice of allowing ones hair to grow naturally as a symbol of devotion to god and lack of worldliness this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august  learn how and

similarly praised her portrayal the ethereal vyjayanthimala barely  illuminates the screen with her stunning beauty moving around daintily from one song to the otherthe closeup shots of vyjayanthimala highlight her ability to convey so much with so little effortnagin was a precursor to her rise in hindi cinema as an iconic actor who combined her talents performing and dancing to rule the screen on

selected for chandramukhis role but she refused to accept the role the role was later offered to bina rai and suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of paro which was earlier offered to meena kumari subsequently the film unit suffered with financial crisis and at this point vyjayanthimala offered to do the role of chandramukhi where she said to bimal roy i am ready if you think i can do it on the other hand nabendu ghosh the script writer of devdas said that i did not approve of vyjayanthimala as chandramukhi but we had no option – no one wanted to play chandramukhi and we were committed to our distributorsshe was of course a very good actress but she was too young for chandramukhi as envisioned by saratbabu on her performance rediff wrote vyjayanthimala imbues chandramukhi with true sympathy who better than chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless lovevyjayanthimala a star after the blockbuster nagin still had to establish her

dance style that evolves with the evolution in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman who in love with devdas has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman for vyjayantimala the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema – her dance subsequently she won filmfare award for best supporting actress but refused to accept it stating that her role was a leading one and in equal

the two main dances in new delhi — the solo bharatnatayam aliruppu number and the bhangra folk dance in her punjabi avtaar and she is absolutely brilliant in the bhangra folk dancein her second avtar

curiosity and pity for the grief that anand is going through and karan bali from upperstallcom wrote that for vyjayanthimala the film showcases both her acting as well as dancing abilities and the dizzying success of madhumati took vyjayanthimala to the highest rungs of stardomto cap off an extremely successful year for her both as an actress of considerable dramatic merit and as a star

humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

horses and orangutans are among the few species that may grow their head hair very long humans are believed to have lost their fur – million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna as an effect of natural selection since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated an exception was however head hair which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun to protect against ultraviolet radiation exposure and also to provide cooling when sweat evaporates from soaked haircitation needed the ability to grow straight hair has been observed among homo sapiens subgroups in less sunny regions further away from the equator relative to kinky afrotextured hair straight hair allows more uv light to pass to the scalp which is essential for the production of vitamin d that is important for bone development scientists also view the ability to grow very long hair as a result of sexual selection since long and healthy hair is a sign of fertility and youthneed quotation to verify an evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health signifying a womans reproductive potential as hair grows slowly long hair may reveal – years of a persons health status nutrition age and reproductive fitness

long in battle such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off also in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle they were known to cut the front short but leave it long in the back where it was more out of reach a widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies reach the ponytail method allowed warriors who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice

agesedit in the european middle ages shorter hair often signified servitude and peasantry while long hair was often attributed to freemen as was the case with the germanic goths and merovingians the gaelic irish both men and women took great pride in their long hair—for example a person could be heavily fined for cutting a mans hair short against his will when the anglonormans and the english colonized ireland hair length came to signify ones allegiance irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their irish heritage likewise english colonists who wore their hair long in the back were deemed to be forsaking their role as english subjects and giving in to the irish life thus hair length was one of the most common ways of judging a true englishman in this period muslims in christian areas were ordered to keep their hair short and parted as their longer style was considered rebellious and barbaric empress elisabeth of austria wearing thighlength hair in  painting by franz xaver winterhalter the long hair tradition was widespread among english and french men in the th and th centuries though it was considered mostly because of endorsement of the roman catholic church acceptable for men also to have shorter hair the tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle causing the people to follow wulfstan a religious leader worried that those with longer hair would fight like women and be unable to protect england from foreign invasion this idea can be found in later military leaders as well such as those of the american confederacy knights and rulers would also sometimes cut or pull out their hair in order to show penitence and mourning and a squires hair was generally shorter than a knights married women who let their hair flow out in public were frowned upon as this was normally reserved for the unwed although they were allowed to let it out in mourning to show their distressed state through these centuries it was expected of eastern christians to wear long hair as well as long beards which was especially expected from clergy and monks in england during the english civil wars of  to  male hair length was emblematic of the disputes between cavaliers and roundheads puritans cavaliers wore longer hair and were less religiousminded thought of by the roundheads as lecherous the more devout roundheads typically had somewhat shorter hair around this time long hair in england also came to be associated with adventurers who traveled to america and were familiar with the native culture there short hair with less adventurous types recent trends among womenedit the seven sutherland sisters were singing and showing off their famous floorlength hair in a sideshow of barnum  baileys from about  to  opera singer mary garden in  with kneelength hair indonesian woman with waistlength hair dutch woman with thighlength hair ngbandi girls with hiplength hair growing and wearing long hair was common among women in the western world until world war one long female hair never ceased in western culture though it was rare during the s and s and was frequent especially around  and citation needed in most current cultures it is more typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so an american study shows significant correlation between hair length and age which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women a significant correlation was also found between womens hair length and hair quality moreover hair quality was correlated with the womens perceived physical health consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology these results indicate that hair length and quality can act as a cue to a womans youth and health signifying reproductive potential the correlation between the womans hair length and marital status or number of children was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age recent trends among menedit long male hair in western youth culture became popular in the s and s with the beatles bob marley made rastafari culture and dreadlocks popular also outside jamaica before world war one men generally had longer hair and beards however short hair on men was introduced in world war one for soldiers slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads the trench warfare in  to  exposed men to flea and lice infestations which prompted the order to cut short hair establishing a military tradition and it expanded among civils by imitation beat poets during the s wore longer hairstyles by  a small beatnik community in newquay cornwall england including a young wizz jones had attracted the attention of their neighbors for growing their hair to a length past the shoulders resulting in a television interview with alan whicker on bbc televisions tonight series the s also introduced the beatles who started a more widespread longer hair trend the social revolution of the s led to a renaissance of unchecked hair growth and long hair especially on men was worn as a political or countercultural symbol or protest and as a symbol of masculinity this cultural symbol extended to several western countries in the americas western europe south africa and australia specific long hairstyles such as dreadlocks have been part of counterculture movements seeking to define other alternative cultures and lifestyles since this time longer hair in general remained popular due to the youth rebellion throughout the liberal decade of the s the long hair trend grew with the spread of the hippie movement in the s and in the s longer hair styles would become the norm among men and women in the s the popularity of jamaicas reggae music and musician bob marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally the antiestablishment philosophy of rastafari echoed in much of the reggae of the time resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among african americans and other blacks but among counterculture whites as well eastern christians are encouragedby whom to wear long hair with long beard in the s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or countercultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged thencontemporary views of tradition in the s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts for example musicians in metal bands and their fans often wear long hair long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization such as locks of love for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate today long hair has gained even more popularity even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back this could in part be due to the man bun trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer hair back into a topknot bun hairstyle african americansedit when african slaves were freed in america they struggled to reach the social status of whites many former slaves tried to conform their hairstyles as part of this struggle women especially felt pressure to make their hair long and oily rather than keeping the shorter tightly coiled style they had known however during the civil rights movement of the s and s africanamericans such as malcolm x advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks in order to embrace their race and to return to west african roots social pressures at the time were heavily influencing these americans women to have long straight hair like white people did this resulted in the black is beautiful movement wherein african americans wore long hair that was however untreated and unmodified more recently hairextensions have become widespread scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have long smooth hair amelia jones points out that dolls for children such as barbies add to this pressure citing as an example a new black barbie with long hair blacks she believes should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to tame their hair contemporary north americaedit  it was estimated that  of american women wore shoulder length hair or longer  of women in ages  to  meaning slightly more than  of men and women altogether similar frequency was found in  when it was estimated that about  of the us adult population male as well as females has hair shoulderlength or longer about  have hair reaching to the bottom of the shoulder blades or longer about  have hair waist length or longer and only about  have hair buttockslength or longer by extrapolating the above data and the number of hair length records the number of people with shoulderlength hair or longer in the usa is estimated to be  million those with waistlength hair roughly  those with buttockslength hair to be  with knee length hair to  and with ankle length hair to  middle eastedit judaismedit strict orthodox judaism forbids men from cutting their sidelocks but other hair may be kept as desired hair is not cut during a time of mourning the torah in deuteronomy  prohibits removing hair in mourning for the dead islamedit transjordanian bedouin with shoulder length hair during world war ii in the muslim world it seems the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men in the past bedouin muslims often wore their hair in long braids but influences from the western world have caused a change in attitudes bedouins are now less likely to have long hair islamic countries in north africa such as egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the egyptian police viewed it as satanic and a sign of an infidel spanish rulers during the medieval period suspected longhaired males to be moors or moriscos therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a moorish custom however modern north african men have adopted western short hair muslims regard the prophet muhammad as the best example to live by and try to emulate him whenever possible the islamic prophet muhammad reportedly in sahih muslim had hair that hung over his shoulders and earlobes sahih bukhari regarded the most authentic of hadith also supports this using a prime example of the prophet isa jesus the prophet muhammad has also described jesus as having long hair reaching his ear lobes maliks muwatta  reported yahya related to me from malik from yahya ibn said that abu qatada alansari said to the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace i have a lot of hair which comes down to my shoulders shall i comb it the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said yes and honour it sometimes abu qatada oiled it twice in one day because the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said to him honour it with regards to women neither quran nor sunnah explicitly state that women cannot cut their hair hadith does mention that women should not imitate men and vice versa and hence many scholars on this assumption decree that women should let their hair grow longer than the hair of the prophet reaching beyond their shoulders as hadith mentions that the prophet had his hair between his shoulder and his earlobes he described jesuss hair which hung to his earlobes as long however according to some hadiths regarding the rules of awrah women are required to grow hair long long enough that it would cover the breasts or as much awrah parts of the body when theyre being buried because she lacks clothes and long hair would be used as a covering instead some muslims are also opposed to men having long hair as it is also important in islam to have clear differences in appearance between sexes and generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair the taliban in afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the prophet similar measures have been taken by islamists in iraq in spite of this several taliban affiliated members of the mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair the saudi islamist fighter amir khattab was also notable for his long hair dervishes of some sufi orders such as the kasnazani often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals native americansedit yakima boy with midback level hair photo by edward s curtis – many native american men wore long hair before the arrival of western influences on their culture in cherokee legends for example males said to be handsome were often described as having long hair almost to the ground or similar formulas both men and women of these cultures have frequently struggled to maintain their tradition but have faced heavy opposition many consider it a sign of giving in to western influences to have their hair cut early american settlers saw longhaired native men as rebelling against their civilized society mountain men and trappers who adopted the customs were also considered amoral and often identified by their long hair since the cultural movements of the sixties and seventies however native americans have felt less pressure to have short hair as different movements have defended their cultural rights for example several states have loosened prison regulations allowing native americans to wear long hair during incarceration along with other cultural allowances there has been resistance to these changes however as long hair is sometimes used to hide drugs as well as to identify with a gang africaedit somali woman with shoulderlength hair throughout much of africa afrotextured hair is the most frequent hair form except among the afroasiatic hamitosemitic speaking populations in north africa and the horn of africa in the latter regions naturally long hair is instead more common in west african cultures women with long hair were highly valued long thick hair was seen as a sign of health strength and capability to bear many children in keeping with this general theme women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so this tradition however did not extend to every west african culture as several valued shorter hair asiaedit historically east asian cultures viewed long hair as a sign of youth and aesthetic beauty long hair is associated with private life and sexuality east asian cultures see long unkempt hair in a woman as a sign of sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter as usually their hair is tied up lay buddhists have long hair while buddhist monks have shaved heads japanese woman combing her long hair colour woodblock print from  by hashiguchi goyō illustration of the tale of genji painted by tosa mitsuoki – chinese orthodox christian man from  nosu girls in china  a hindoo fakir or sadhu with long hair lithograph  by emily eden after lowes cato dickinson chinaedit in ancient china and korea hair was regarded as a precious legacy from parents most people would never cut their hair after they became adults and cutting off ones hair was a penalty for minor crimes both men and women would coil up their hair and many haircoiling styles were developed beginning in  the ethnic manchu qing dynasty forced all men in china to adopt the queue a long braid down the back with the hair near the forehead completely shaved hair length and style became a lifeordeath matter in  as the manchu told them either their hair or their head would be cut by  the population of china had been reduced from  million to just  million as a whole generation resisted the order for the sake of confucian ideals against shaving or harming their hair nearly every han rebel group began by shearing this pigtail most especially in the case of the taiping who were known in chinese as the longhairs but the queue on penalty of death lasted until  when the chinese people cut their queues in unison at a time of rebellion americans at first judged chinese immigrant laborers to be poor workers because their long hair brought an association with women islamic and christian missionaries among the chinese were strong advocates of shorter male hair for their converts around the destruction of four olds period in  almost anything seen as part of traditional chinese culture would lead to problems with the communist red guards items that attracted dangerous attention if caught in the public included jewelry and long male hair these things were regarded as symbols of bourgeois lifestyle that represented wealth people had to avoid them or suffer serious consequences such as tortures and beatings by the guards more recently long hair was ridiculed in china from october  to december  as part of the short and unsuccessful antispiritual pollution campaign also in chinese ancient and modern poetry long hair is a common symbol used by poets for example li bai and li shangyin to express their depression and sadness southeast asiaedit in southeast asia and indonesia male long hair was valued in until the seventeenth century when the area adopted outside influences including islam and christianity invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men as a sign of servitude as well they were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas such as thailand and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair they came up with several mythical stories one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and in a rage demanded that all women keep their hair short in rural areas in certain asian countries for example india girls still usually let their hair grow long and kneelength hair is not unusual japanedit in the medieval japan heian gentleman were not very interested in a womans physical beauty and rarely had an opportunity to see it the only physical attribute of interest was a womans hair which had to be thick and longer than she was tall the fascination with long hair was one reason why a womans becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness — it could never again grow to its full length this explains why genji refuses to let murasaki his de facto wife in the classical japanese novel the tale of genji take the tonsure when she

to accept the role the role was later offered to bina rai and suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of paro which was earlier offered to meena kumari subsequently

nabendu ghosh the script writer of devdas said that i did not approve of vyjayanthimala as chandramukhi but we had no option – no one wanted to play chandramukhi and we were committed to our distributorsshe was of course a very good actress but she was too young for chandramukhi as envisioned by saratbabu on her performance rediff wrote vyjayanthimala imbues chandramukhi with true sympathy who better than chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless lovevyjayanthimala a star after the blockbuster nagin still had to establish her acting credentials when roy went against the

in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman who in love with devdas has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman for vyjayantimala the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema – her dance subsequently she won filmfare award for best supporting actress but refused to accept it stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by suchitra sen and

woman with midback level hair humans horses and orangutans are among the few species that may grow their head hair very long humans are believed to have lost their fur – million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna as an effect of natural selection since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated an exception was however head hair which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun to protect against ultraviolet radiation exposure and also to provide cooling when sweat evaporates from soaked haircitation needed the ability to grow straight hair has been observed among homo sapiens subgroups in less sunny regions further away from the equator relative to kinky afrotextured hair straight hair allows more uv light to pass to the scalp which is essential for the production of vitamin d that is important for bone development scientists also view the ability to grow very long hair as a result of sexual selection since long and healthy hair is a sign of fertility and youthneed quotation to verify an evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health signifying a womans reproductive potential as hair grows slowly long hair may reveal – years of a persons health status nutrition age and reproductive fitness malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color eg dark hair turning reddish psychological significanceedit anthropologists speculate that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment a byproduct of secondary natural selection once other androgenicsomatic hair body hair had largely been lost another possibility is that long head hair is a result of fisherian runaway sexual selection where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual for some groups or individuals however short hair is the selected trait by seven to nine months infants can tell the sexes apart based on hair length voice pitch and faces cultural meaningedit ways of life often viewed as more rigid such as soldiers and religious cultures frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length for example buddhist monks shave their heads as part of their order of worship similarly religious men with long hair include the nazarites of the hebrew bible samson being a famous example and the sikhs subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length as was the case with the gaelic irish under english rule and the moors under spanish rule in medieval spainclarification needed east asian cultures have traditionally seen long unkempt hair in a woman as a sign of sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter as usually their hair is tied up in styles such as the ponytail plait or any bun transferred meaningedit the

given time about  of hair strands are in anagen the fibroblast growth factor  fgf gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans blocking fgf in the human scalp by applying a herbal extract that blocked fgf extends the hair cycle resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth cultural historyedit in jewish and christian scripturesedit she as a veil down to the slender waist her unadorned golden tresses wore dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved as the vine curls her tendrils – john miltons description of eve in paradise lost in the old testament the nazirites would go for long periods of time without cutting their hair to show devotion to god samson is one example his strength depended upon his refraining from cutting his hair described as worn in seven locks in the new testament saint paul formerly saul of tarsus wrote doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering but if any seem contentious we have no such custom neither do the churches of god an interpretation from observing nature the male animals such as the lion have the longer hair than the female thus it is not a shame for a man to have long hair western cultureedit ancient greece and romeedit in ancient greece long male hair was a symbol of wealth and power while a shaven head was appropriate for a slave the ancient greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long including zeus achilles apollo and poseidon greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off also in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle they were known to cut the front short but leave it long in the back where it was more out of reach a widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies reach the ponytail method allowed warriors who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice around the sixth century however the greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles with the exception of the spartans women in the culture remained with the longer style which for them showed freedom health and wealth as well as good behavior in men it was considered a sign of false pride by this time pliny the elder in his natural history and varro related that the romans did not begin to cut their hair short until barbers were introduced to italy from sicily by p ticinius mena in  bc women in roman times valued long hair usually with a center part apart from in the earliest times mens hair was usually shorter than womens although other cultures of the time such as greeks in the east considered long hair to be typical of philosophers who were thought to be too engrossed in learning to bother with hair strictly in the province of rome however the shorter hairstyle was especially popular when julius caesar conquered the gauls who favored long hair he ordered it to be cut short middle agesedit in the european middle ages shorter hair often signified servitude and peasantry while long hair was often attributed to freemen as was the case with the germanic goths and merovingians the gaelic irish both men and women took great pride in their long hair—for example a person could be heavily fined for cutting a mans hair short against his will when the anglonormans and the english colonized ireland hair length came to signify ones allegiance irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their irish heritage likewise english colonists who wore their hair long in the back were deemed to be forsaking their role as english subjects and giving in to the irish life thus hair length was one of the most common ways of judging a true englishman in this period muslims in christian areas were ordered to keep their hair short and parted as their longer style was considered rebellious and barbaric empress elisabeth of austria wearing thighlength hair in  painting by franz xaver winterhalter the long hair tradition was widespread among english and french men in the th and th centuries though it was considered mostly because of endorsement of the roman catholic church acceptable for men also to have shorter hair the tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle causing the people to follow wulfstan a religious leader worried that those with longer hair would fight like women and be unable to protect england from foreign invasion this idea can be found in later military leaders as well such as those of the american confederacy knights and rulers would also sometimes cut or pull out their hair in order to show penitence and mourning and a squires hair was generally shorter than a knights married women who let their hair flow out in public were frowned upon as this was normally reserved for the unwed although they were allowed to let it out in mourning to show their distressed state through these centuries it was expected of eastern christians to wear long hair as well as long beards which was especially expected from clergy and monks in england during the english civil wars of  to  male hair length was emblematic of the disputes between cavaliers and roundheads puritans cavaliers wore longer hair and were less religiousminded thought of by the roundheads as lecherous the more devout roundheads typically had somewhat shorter hair around this time long hair in england also came to be associated with adventurers who traveled to america and were familiar with the native culture there short hair with less adventurous types recent trends among womenedit the seven sutherland sisters were singing and showing off their famous floorlength hair in a sideshow of barnum  baileys from about  to  opera singer mary garden in  with kneelength hair indonesian woman with waistlength hair dutch woman with thighlength hair ngbandi girls with hiplength hair growing and wearing long hair was common among women in the western world until world war one long female hair never ceased in western culture though it was rare during the s and s and was frequent especially around  and citation needed in most current cultures it is more typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so an american study shows significant correlation between hair length and age which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women a significant correlation was also found between womens hair length and hair quality moreover hair quality was correlated with the womens perceived physical health consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology these results indicate that hair length and quality can act as a cue to a womans youth and health signifying reproductive potential the correlation between the womans hair length and marital status or number of children was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age recent trends among menedit long male hair in western youth culture became popular in the s and s with the beatles bob marley made rastafari culture and dreadlocks popular also outside jamaica before world war one men generally had longer hair and beards however short hair on men was introduced in world war one for soldiers slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads the trench warfare in  to  exposed men to flea and lice infestations which prompted the order to cut short hair establishing a military tradition and it expanded among civils by imitation beat poets during the s wore longer hairstyles by  a small beatnik community in newquay cornwall england including a young wizz jones had attracted the attention of their neighbors for growing their hair to a length past the shoulders resulting in a television interview with alan whicker on bbc televisions tonight series the s also introduced the beatles who started a more widespread longer hair trend the social revolution of the s led to a renaissance of unchecked hair growth and long hair especially on men was worn as a political or countercultural symbol or protest and as a symbol of masculinity this cultural symbol extended to several western countries in the americas western europe south africa and australia specific long hairstyles such as dreadlocks have been part of counterculture movements seeking to define other alternative cultures and lifestyles since this time longer hair in general remained popular due to the youth rebellion throughout the liberal decade of the s the long hair trend grew with the spread of the hippie movement in the s and in the s longer hair styles would become the norm among men and women in the s the popularity of jamaicas reggae music and musician bob marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally the antiestablishment philosophy of rastafari echoed in much of the reggae of the time resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among african americans and other blacks but among counterculture whites as well eastern christians are encouragedby whom to wear long hair with long beard in the s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or countercultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged thencontemporary views of tradition in the s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts for example musicians in metal bands and their fans often wear long hair long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization such as locks of love for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate today long hair has gained even more popularity even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back this could in part be due to the man bun trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer hair back into a topknot bun hairstyle african americansedit when african slaves were freed in america they struggled to reach the social status of whites many former slaves tried to conform their hairstyles as part of this struggle women especially felt pressure to make their hair long and oily rather than keeping the shorter tightly coiled style they had known however during the civil rights movement of the s and s africanamericans such as malcolm x advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks in order to embrace their race and to return to west african roots social pressures at the time were heavily influencing these americans women to have long straight hair like white people did this resulted in the black is beautiful movement wherein african americans wore long hair that was however untreated and unmodified more recently hairextensions have become widespread scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have long smooth hair amelia jones points out that dolls for children such as barbies add to this pressure citing as an example a new black barbie with long hair blacks she believes should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to tame their hair contemporary north americaedit  it was estimated that  of american women wore shoulder length hair or longer  of women in ages  to  meaning slightly more than  of men and women altogether similar frequency was found in  when it was estimated that about  of the us adult population male as well as females has hair shoulderlength or longer about  have hair reaching to the bottom of the shoulder blades or longer about  have hair waist length or longer and only about  have hair buttockslength or longer by extrapolating the above data and the number of hair length records the number of people with shoulderlength hair or longer in the usa is estimated to be  million those with waistlength hair roughly  those with buttockslength hair to be  with knee length hair to  and with ankle length hair to  middle eastedit judaismedit strict orthodox judaism forbids men from cutting their sidelocks but other hair may be kept as desired hair is not cut during a time of mourning the torah in deuteronomy  prohibits removing hair in mourning for the dead islamedit transjordanian bedouin with shoulder length hair during world war ii in the muslim world it seems the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men in the past bedouin muslims often wore their hair in long braids but influences from the western world have caused a change in attitudes bedouins are now less likely to have long hair islamic countries in north africa such as egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the egyptian police viewed it as satanic and a sign of an infidel spanish rulers during the medieval period suspected longhaired males to be moors or moriscos therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a moorish custom however modern north african men have adopted western short hair muslims regard the prophet muhammad as the best example to live by and try to emulate him whenever possible the islamic prophet muhammad reportedly in sahih muslim had hair that hung over his shoulders and earlobes sahih bukhari regarded the most authentic of hadith also supports this using a prime example of the prophet isa jesus the prophet muhammad has also described jesus as having long hair reaching his ear lobes maliks muwatta  reported yahya related to me from malik from yahya ibn said that abu qatada alansari said to the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace i have a lot of hair which comes down to my shoulders shall i comb it the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said yes and honour it sometimes abu qatada oiled it twice in one day because the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said to him honour it with regards to women neither quran nor sunnah explicitly state that women cannot cut their hair hadith does mention that women should not imitate men and vice versa and hence many scholars on this assumption decree that women should let their hair grow longer than the hair of the prophet reaching beyond their shoulders as hadith mentions that the prophet had his hair between his shoulder and his earlobes he described jesuss hair which hung to his earlobes as long however according to some hadiths regarding the rules of awrah women are required to grow hair long long enough that it would cover the breasts or as much awrah parts of the body when theyre being buried because she lacks clothes and long hair would be used as a covering instead some muslims are also opposed to men having long hair as it is also important in islam to have clear differences in appearance between sexes and generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair the taliban in afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the prophet similar measures have been taken by islamists in iraq in spite of this several taliban affiliated members of the mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair the saudi islamist fighter amir khattab was also notable for his long hair dervishes of some sufi orders such as the kasnazani often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals native americansedit yakima boy with midback level hair photo by edward s curtis – many native american men wore long hair before the arrival of western influences on their culture in cherokee legends for example males said to be handsome were often described as having long hair almost to the ground or similar formulas both men and women of these cultures have frequently struggled to maintain their tradition but have faced heavy opposition many consider it a sign of giving in to western influences to have their hair cut early american settlers saw longhaired native men as rebelling against their civilized society mountain men and trappers who adopted the customs were also considered amoral and often identified by their long hair since the cultural movements of the sixties and seventies however native americans have felt less pressure to have short hair as different movements have defended their cultural rights for example several states have loosened prison regulations allowing native americans to wear long hair during incarceration along with other cultural allowances there has been resistance to these changes however as long hair is sometimes used to hide drugs as well as to identify with a gang africaedit somali woman with shoulderlength hair throughout much of africa afrotextured hair is the most frequent hair form except among the afroasiatic hamitosemitic speaking populations in north africa and the horn of africa in the latter regions naturally long hair is instead more common in west african cultures women with long hair were highly valued long thick hair was seen as a sign of health strength and capability to bear many children in keeping with this general theme women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so this tradition however did not extend to every west african culture as several valued shorter hair asiaedit historically east asian cultures viewed long hair as a sign of youth and aesthetic beauty long hair is associated with private life and sexuality east asian cultures see long unkempt hair in a woman as a sign of sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter as usually their hair is tied up lay buddhists have long hair while buddhist monks have shaved heads japanese woman combing her long hair colour woodblock print from  by hashiguchi goyō illustration of the tale of genji painted by tosa mitsuoki – chinese orthodox christian man from  nosu girls in china  a hindoo fakir or sadhu with long hair lithograph  by emily eden after lowes cato dickinson chinaedit in ancient china and korea hair was regarded as a precious legacy from parents most people would never cut their hair after they became adults and cutting off ones hair was a penalty for minor crimes both men and women would coil up their hair and many haircoiling styles were developed beginning in  the ethnic manchu qing dynasty forced all men in china to adopt the queue a long braid down the back with the hair near the forehead completely shaved hair length and style became a lifeordeath matter in  as the manchu told them either their hair or their head would be cut by  the population of china had been reduced from  million to just  million as a whole generation resisted the order for the sake of confucian ideals against shaving or harming their hair nearly every han rebel group began by shearing this pigtail most especially in the case of the taiping who were known in chinese as the longhairs but the queue on penalty of death lasted until  when the chinese people cut their queues in unison at a time of rebellion americans at first judged chinese immigrant laborers to be poor workers because their long hair brought an association with women islamic and christian missionaries among the chinese were strong advocates of shorter male hair for their converts around the destruction of four olds period in  almost anything seen as part of traditional chinese culture would lead to problems with the communist red guards items that attracted dangerous attention if caught in the public included jewelry and long male hair these things were regarded as symbols of bourgeois lifestyle that represented wealth people had to avoid them or suffer serious consequences such as tortures and beatings by the guards more recently long hair was ridiculed in china from october  to december  as part of the short and unsuccessful antispiritual pollution campaign also in chinese ancient and modern poetry long hair is a common symbol used by poets for example li bai and li shangyin to express their depression and sadness southeast asiaedit in southeast asia and indonesia male long hair was valued in until the seventeenth century when the area adopted outside influences including islam and christianity invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men as a sign of servitude as well they were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas such as thailand and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair they came up with several mythical stories one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and in a rage demanded that all women keep their hair short in rural areas in certain asian countries for example india girls still usually let their hair grow long and kneelength hair is not unusual japanedit in the medieval japan heian gentleman were not very interested in a womans physical beauty and rarely had an opportunity to see it the only physical attribute of interest was a womans hair which had to be thick and longer than she was tall the fascination with long hair was one reason why a womans becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness — it could never again grow to its full length this explains why genji refuses to let murasaki his de facto wife in the classical japanese novel the tale of genji take the tonsure when she is ill sikhismedit for sikhs kesh is the practice of allowing ones hair to grow naturally as a symbol of devotion to god and lack of worldliness this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august  learn how and when to remove this template message the sikhs were commanded by guru gobind singh at the baisakhi amrit sanchar in  to wear long uncut hair called kesh at all times to signify the strength and vitality of the sikh people this was one of the five requisites of faith collectively called kakars that form the external visible identifiers to clearly affirm a sikhs commitment and dedication to the order hukam of the tenth master and made one a member of the khalsa the khalsa is the saintsoldier of guru gobind singh who stated the following he does not recognize anyone else except one lord not even the bestowal of charities performance of merciful acts austerities and restraint on pilgrimstations the perfect light of the lord illuminates his heart then consider him as the immaculate khalsa guru gobind singh in the dasam granth page  the kesh or unshorn long hair is an indispensable part of the human body as created by waheguru that is the mainstay of the jivan jaach and the rehni that was prescribed by guru gobind singh sahib by which a sikh is clearly and quickly identified kesh the kanga another requisite of faith is usually tucked behind the rishi knot and tied under the turban the uncut long head hair and the beard in the case of men forms the main kakar for the sikhs kesadhari a term defining a sikh as one who carries on his head the full growth of his kes hair which he never trims or cuts for any reason anyone sikh or nonsikh may keep the hair unshorn but for the sikh kes unshorn hair is a requisite of faith and an inviolable vow the sikh rahit maryada published by the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee statutory body for the control and management of sikh shrines and by extension for laying down rules about sikh beliefs and practices issued in  after long and minute deliberations among sikh scholars and theologians defines a sikh thus every sikh who has been admitted to the rites of amrit ie who has been initiated as a sikh must allow his
