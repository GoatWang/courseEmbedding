airborne wireless network airborne wireless network developer of the worlds first and only airborne wholesale carrier network learn more airborne wireless network is poised to create the future of airborne connectivity the network was conceived almost twenty years ago at a time when fast internet was a luxury only few could afford the network was conceived by a forwardthinking entrepreneur who had the vision of creating a global datapipeline or airborne digital superhighway providing worldwide broadband connectivity using commercial aircraft airborne wireless network for its wholesale carrier network awn intends to use commercial aircraft as minisatellites the network is configured with robust meshedredundancy the two most significant advantages over traditional singlelink satellite  celltowerbased technologies are  greater throughput  nearly  realtime not store and forward wholesale carrier network for its wholesale carrier network awn intends to use commercial aircraft as “minisatellites” the company’s primary target customerbase will be worldwide data and communications service providers  awns primary advantages global service upon successful development awn’s wholesale carrier network would be the first and only true airborne broadband pipeline providing connectivity for worldwide broadband carrier services using commercial aircraft patented technology in  during the pioneering days of wireless dataconnectivity the networks inventor submitted a patent application to the us patent and trademark office and on september   us patent number us  b was granted a few days later an event occurred which changed the airline industry and which would delay development of this disruptive technology for a number of years in  awn acquired this patent and intends to further develop and deploy this technology advanced wireless technology when awn’s patent was granted the wireless radio technology to enable implementation of the network did not exist in the commercial realm hence “inhouse development” or prohibitively expensive advanced military communicationequipment were the only options today much of what is required is readily available the equipment just needs to be packaged “purposespecific” to comply with faa and fcc regulations a virtual airborne “worldwide web” because it is a meshed network it is like a web where all nodes are connected via multiple links with traditional “single linksystems” such as most celltower and satellite systems there are no single points of failure there is nearly always another aircraft ship or earthstation within range of an aircraft realtime performance  not “store and forward” nearly  realtime not store and forward traditional technologies suffer from “single points of failure” in awns network if a link is interrupted the signal is redirected to the next participating aircraft ship or earthstation in the chain awn’s system is designed with the security of meshed redundant datapaths easy to update upgrade or servicing as new software becomes available the system can be easily updated when new and more efficient datatransmission technologies emerge upgrading awn’s system can be as easy as replacing a single module and the system is ready for “the future” the network is never obsolete satellite technology on the other hand in most cases has already been surpassed by the time a satellite is launched these cannot be upgraded or serviced once launched no space junk unlike satellites which can be disabled or knocked out of orbit by spacejunk awn’s system operates in a safe and controlled environment typically between  and  feet  m space junk has been known to cause serious damage to commercial and military satellites the proposed launch of thousands more satellites translates to huge amounts of additional spacejunk scientists estimate that by  over  billion pieces of manmade space junk could be orbiting the earth jeopardizing the future manned space travel proposed spacejunk management video space junk – critical density article summary of core awn features airborne wireless network is developing a fully meshed network while current technologies only allow for a “single path” solution what is the difference between single path and fully meshed networks multiple paths in a singlepath network there is only one way path a signal reaches an aircraft if this path is interrupted the system fails to illustrate this imagine a single road between the east and west coasts if one of the bridges is washed out one would not be able to reach hisher destination until it was repaired meshed network in a fully meshed network signals come in from multiple directions the system will route signals around any “obstructions” and “realtime connectivity” is maintained in layman’s terms because we have a choice of many highways between the coasts we can drive around the washed out bridge and reach our destination no single point of failure besides mechanical problems which constitute “single points of failure” satellites in aeronautical applications more likely their uplinks than their downlinks and fixedpoint ground stations can be affected by heavy rain the “right size” raindrops can completely absorb or block a radio signal the network dynamically assigns a path around the “obstructions” providing a solid path regardless of the presence

civilian airtoair communication system a first of its kind the company’s application cover letter states “airborne wireless network is making application for a supplemental type certificate stc for a broadband transceiver system to be installed in boeing  aircraft this new patented broadband system will provide light weight low power low cost microwave relay stations on equipped aircraft the new system provides a chain of airborne repeaters providing communications along the entire flight paths the purpose of the new project is to replace lowearth orbit leo communication satellites with broadband wireless communications networks linking aircraft to aircraft and ground stations” this faa application is significant as the company intends to expand on this initial certification program to include multiple aircraft types including all major airframes actively flying in the worlds airline fleets since our system is to be deployed on existing commercial aircraft and not on unmanned platforms there are no limitations on flights over populated areas making it the most affordable and practical way to achieve future global connectivity this initial faa certification has been submitted on a noninterfering basis meaning that the system will not interfere with existing onboard aircraft systems looking to the future the company intends to cross into the cockpit and provide essential services with true broadband data to the flight crews the faa and airlines this would enable unprecedented aircraft location services as well as other aviation safety applications

airborne wireless network    about airborne wireless network awns primary advantages global service upon successful development awn’s wholesale carrier network would be the first and only true airborne broadband pipeline providing connectivity for worldwide broadband carrier services using commercial aircraft advanced wireless technology when awn’s patent was granted the wireless radio technology to enable implementation of the network did not exist in the commercial realm hence “inhouse development” or prohibitively expensive advanced military communicationequipment were the only options today much of what is required is readily available the equipment just needs to be packaged “purposespecific” to comply with faa and fcc regulations realtime performance  not “store and forward” nearly  realtime not store and forward traditional technologies suffer from “single points of failure” in awns network if a link is interrupted the signal is redirected to the next participating aircraft ship or earthstation in the chain awn’s system is designed with the security of meshed redundant datapaths no space junk unlike satellites which can be disabled or knocked out of orbit by spacejunk awn’s system operates in a safe and controlled environment typically between  and  feet  m space junk has been known to cause serious damage to commercial and military satellites the proposed launch of thousands more satellites translates to huge amounts of additional spacejunk scientists estimate that by  over  billion pieces of manmade space junk could be orbiting the earth jeopardizing the future manned space travel patented technology in  during the pioneering days of wireless dataconnectivity the networks inventor submitted a patent application to the us patent and trademark office and on september   us patent number us  b was granted a few days later an event occurred which changed the airline industry and which would delay development of this disruptive technology for a number of years in  awn acquired this patent and intends to further develop and deploy this technology a virtual airborne “worldwide web” because it is a meshed network it is like a web where all nodes are connected via multiple links with traditional “single linksystems” such as most celltower and satellite systems there are no single points of failure there is nearly always another aircraft ship or earthstation within range of an aircraft easy to update upgrade or servicing as new software becomes available the system can be easily updated when new and more efficient datatransmission technologies emerge upgrading awn’s system can be as easy as replacing a single module and the system is ready for “the future” the network is never obsolete satellite technology on the other hand in most cases has already been surpassed by the time a satellite is launched these cannot be upgraded or serviced once launched source wwwairbornewirelessnetworkcom disclaimer fn media
