investigative journalism and original storytelling they presented a different way of looking at the world we began with a simple tagline stories only we can tell we then designed a shape—a trapezoid—to symbolize an alternate view then broke it down into ownable defining colours and shapes that created an approachable stylized feel for the master brand we then updated their logo to be seen clearly across multiple platforms and devices bold colours distinct lines and signature animations brought their formerly disparate shows and onair branding together to form a strong cohesive
