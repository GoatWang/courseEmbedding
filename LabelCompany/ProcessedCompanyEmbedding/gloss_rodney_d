the standard notices and then review the first quarters results jeff will then provide us perspective on results and on our business well conclude with a questionandanswer sessionplease remember that certain statements made during this conference are forwardlooking statements within the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended these forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations estimates assumptions and projections that are subject to change and actual results may differ materially from the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include those risks and uncertainties described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including our form k for the year ended december   as well as our earnings release and any supplemental information any forwardlooking statements are made only as of this date and the company assumes no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement during our remarks well make reference to both gaap and nongaap measures the reconciliation between gaap and nongaap measures is included in the earnings press release which is available on our websitefor the first quarter of  those adjustments to net income to derive adjusted ebitda include interest expense of  income tax benefit of  depreciation and amortization of  million a foreign exchange gain of  stock compensation and relocation expense of  i will also be making a distinction between operating cash flows attributable to changes in working capital and other operating sources and uses of cash management believes the changes in working capital provides an indication of cash invested in or provided by changes in such operating assets and liabilities and therefore may indicate trends in operating performance and may identify a significant source or use of cashoperating cash flow exclusive of changes in working capital is believed to provide an estimate of the cash generated from all operating activities prior to investments andor liquidations of such operating assets and liabilities ill now compare the first quarter of  to the first quarter of  noting financial highlights and explaining selected metricsnet sales decreased  million or  primarily due to heavy promotional activity by branded competitors and other competitive pressures as noted in previous quarters parent roll sales were  million in both quarters and converted product sales decreased  million to  point million  im sorry  million  million of the decrease in revenue was attributable to the decreased numbers of tons sold and  million was attributable to a decline in the average price per ton that reflects the changing mix of customers buying a changing mix of products rather than outright price decreasesread morecost of sales exclusive of depreciation decreased  million or  tons sold decreased by  leading to a decrease of  million in cost of sales however the average cost per unit increased  offsetting  million of this decrease the addition of labor overhead and startup costs for barnwell not yet been fully offset by production and absorption account for the largest portion of the relative cost increase the decline in production volumes drove decreased absorption and unfavorable efficiency variances to which we attribute roughly  million of the change in costs increases in repairs and maintenance about  direct labor increases of about  and other cost increases were more than offset by savings principally from lower fiber costs and from decreased freight costsinterest expense increased  or  to  principally to an increased debt level our interest rate is also variable and dependent upon our financial leverage most interest incurred continues to be capitalized at barnwell south carolina capital project pending its completion a tax benefit of   yes  was recognized in the first quarter of  compared to tax expense of  million in the first quarter of  reflecting both the decline in the pretax earnings and the companys recognition of tax credits the effect of combined tax rate estimate in the first quarter of  is  as a result of the foregoing factors a net loss of  or  per basic share was recognized in the first quarter of  compared to net income of  million or  per basic share in the first quarter of operating cash flows excluding change in working capital decreased  million compared to the first quarter of  primarily reflecting the decrease in net income net of changes and deferred taxes changes in working capital used  million of operating cash flows in the first quarter of  compared to  of operating cash flows in the first quarter of  increased borrowings in both periods were used to finance investments in barnwell facilityin  the company received  million of restricted cash from financings of which  million was used in first quarter  for barnwell facility the company paid dividends of  million in the first quarter of  while dividends declared in the first quarter of  were paid early in the second quarter we already knew that competitive pressures had caused a significant decline in sales and production starting in the second quarter of  so youre probably wondering what changed in the first quarter of  relative to the fourth quarter of  so ill now compare those  quarters net sales decreased  million or  as customers tended to work off high inventory levels following heavy promotional activity by brand competitors and other competitive pressures in prior quarters parent roll sales remained similar between the quarters declining less than  while converted product sales decreased  million a decline in the number of tons sold resulted in  million decrease in net sales while a higher average selling price per tons increased net sales by  cost of sales exclusive of depreciation increased  million or  tons sold decreased by  leading to a decrease in cost of sales of  million however cost increases of  million or  more than offset the decrease the decline in production volumes drove decreased absorption and unfavorable efficiency variances to which we attribute  million of the unfavorable change in cost additionally approximately  million of unfavorable changes in cost of sales resulted from seasonal fluctuations and surging costs that are not expected to be reoccurringthese impacts included unfavorable variances and purchasing rebates increased freight cost for shipments of parent rolls from prior to barnwell seasonal and social security expenses barnwells mill labor and training and other unfavorable variances related to employee benefitsmexicalis costs increased approximately  due principally to increased fiber cost in the west coast and increased local electricity rates while pryor benefited from  of costsavings from its mix of fiber in the fourth quarter barnwell had a favorable inventory adjustment of approximately  which was not replicated in the first quarter repairs and maintenance freight cost for shipments to the west coast and other overhead costs increased to net approximately  realize im quoting quite a few details and its rather convoluted but a lot of different impacts were felt in the first quarteras a result of the foregoing factors a net loss of  was recognized in the first quarter of  compared to net income of  million in the fourth quarter of  ill continue perhaps in a more summary fashion by trying to summarize the change in ebitda ebitda of  million was generated in the fourth quarter of  and ebitda of  million was generated in the first quarter of  average selling prices increased contributing  sales volumes declined reducing the standard gross margin by  sorry strike the word standard that was gross margin change only a reduction of approximately  million is attributable to unfavorable absorption and manufacturing variances in turn attributable to decreased production volumes and significant operating leverage one of the changes in rampup costs  im sorry oneoff changes in rampup costs of  were incurred for example these included labor incurred during training of new employees in barnwell timing of recognition of rebates and other factors noted in the discussion cost of sales a reduction of  is attributable to changes in inventory adjustments at barnwell and to increased repairs and maintenance at barnwell that may or may not be reoccurring net favorable cost adjustments of approximately  in the fourth quarter were not reoccurring in the first quartergoing on to operating cash flows excluding changes in working capital increased  million compared to fourth quarter of  primarily reflecting changes in deferred income taxes net of the decrease in net income changes in working capital used  million of operating cash flows in the first quarter of  compared to providing  of operating cash flows in the fourth quarter of  increased borrowings in both periods were used to finance investments in barnwell facility inaudible paid dividends of  million in the fourth quarter of  at march   debt not having been netted with unamortized deferred debt issuance costs was  million and the adjusted ebitda leverage ratio as defined by our bankers was  million  im so sorry  ratio the banks waived the leverage ratio covenant for the first and second quarters of  providing the company an opportunity to bridge these quarters and rampup operations for new business the total projected expenditure for the barnwell facility is  million to  million of which approximately  million has been expended as of march  ill now turn the call over to mr schoenjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director good morning as rod has discussed we expected the first half of  to be a challenging period until the new business awarded started to be produced and shipped there was a lot of noise in the quarter as we prepared for the new business including inventory adjustments to work out old product in favor of new we began shipping part of the new awards in march and expect to continue to ramp up in q part of the new volume we have started to ship includes ultrapremium product as this new product segment is starting to develop as an acceptable alternative to highcost tad rather than run up the inventory we decided to preserve cash and set the stage for a stepchange in results beginning in q operating cash flows less changes in working capital provided  million in the first quarter of  relative to  million in the fourth quarter of  we avoided stockpiling inventory and were able to exit some rented warehouse space despite spending  million on capital projects we only financed  we only increased financings by  millionmoving on to barnwell ongoing startup costs for the barnwell project impacted the quarter as we are in fullon training mode for operators and mechanics we delayed the expected startup in late q to june of this year to ensure we have an outstanding checkout i was getting increasingly concerned that we were taking shortcuts to hit an expected date rather than doing what is right to ensure a successful startup taking shortcuts during the checkout phase of the capital project is a recipe for major disaster i believe this action will make the startup curve shorter and help ensure we get into full production much sooner than if we had stayed on the present course as stated in our press release production of the new volume that we announced in january representing plus million cases of new business has begun which we expect to be fully implemented by the beginning of the third quarter the barnwell and pryor assets are currently in full production to support this stepchange in volume as we ensure a successful launch we expect the new volume to generate in the area of  million to  million of ebitda i view the conditions in the first quarter as transitory and not a reflection of a permanent drop in ebitda and epsregarding the dividend im sure some investors were surprised with the board decision to suspend the dividend and im sorry for that i think the dividend has played an important part in the growth and income strategy that has been at play for the past  years when we first implemented the dividend in  we believe the stock was illiquid and undervalued the dividend strategy was successful in increasing shareholder value and liquidity in  we embarked on a major expansion and believe the dividend played an important role to maintain liquidity and shareholder value while the barnwell expansion was in development now that the barnwell expansion is essentially complete the board believes that it is prudent to focus on harvesting the capital we have invested and to decrease our leverage to prepare for future growthlooking forward those investors who have enjoyed the benefit of a high dividend yield while waiting for the barnwell expansion to be complete may now look for the growth of the company and subsequent increased enterprise value as we fill up capacity as the expected benefitfor new investors interested in the growth story this may be the opportune time to become part of a true growth story as we leverage the new product and process capabilities we have created and fill up the new capacity of course the dividend may also become part of a future strategy as we decide what are the best paths to maximize shareholder value this as well as other options will be considered at the discretion of the board i view q at the bottom of the parabola our goal is to decrease our concentration risk and the new business awards we achieved in january are a good first step to accomplishing that objective gaining plus million cases of new business is a great achievement for my team and reflects the work of developing new customer relationships new product capabilities and new cost structures that altogether have made this result possible finally we still expect to attain a run rate of  million to  million of ebitda when our new capacity has sold out that is our ultimate goal and is one that has my full attentionwith that i will now turn the call back over to the operatorquestions and answersoperator operator instructions our first question comes from philip ng with jefferiesphilip h ng jefferies llc research division  equity analyst i guess given that youre still ramping up barnwell the facility  the paper facility during q this year what gives you confidence youre going to be able to hit that  million to  million ebitda target in q and do you anticipate there could be some startup costs and underutilization that might weigh on q earnings and obviously the competitive landscape has been far more intense than i think you had anticipated about a year agorodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo mostly the rampup costs will hit us in q the q will have some residual rampup costs but were  as jeff mentioned weve sort of delayed the startup of the middle of barnwell but we expect to ramp it up faster than we did so well hit the bricks running so to speak in june and hence still do most of the rampup in the second quarter continuing into the third quarter does that answer your questionphilip h ng jefferies llc research division  equity analyst yes thats  i guess thats helpful he called out some destocking the quarter from your customers ahead of the restage your private label can you talk about whats exactly going on is that largely behind you and how should we think about it going forwardjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director yes i think some  a couple of our  one of our major customers put it that way still had a lot of residual inventory that we did not really know about and they decided to draw it down rather than have  i mean youre through a relaunch that includes packaging changes so you cant keep this inventory and expect to sell it out in any fashion after you do the launch so they decided to draw it down it came down heavy it was unexpected im pretty sure it impacted more than us in terms of their customers but it is behind us id say  of it is behind us there may be some residual still in the chain but at this point we would view it as behind usphilip h ng jefferies llc research division  equity analyst okay thats helpful and just one last one for me just given the amount of leverage that you guys have its prudent that youre suspending the dividend other than free cash flow youre generating are there any other levers youd look to pull  look to pull to delever a little more quickly and whats your longerterm leverage targetrodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo we  i guess jeff is waiting for me to answer the  were planning on hitting the bank covenants in q that the bank has set some  one thats in q the waivers we got were just for q and q so were aiming for that shortterm longerterm we want to get the leverage ratio down to  or under we get a breaking point in interest there interest cost rates go  change with our leverage ratio and we get a break if we can get under  feeling thats also a good benchmark anyway at least until we undertake some mergers or acquisition strategy or go off in some different route which is in the perhaps distant future at this point distant being at least  year or  years so thats sort of the thinking on the leverage ratio in terms of other cash flow management things we do have some tax returns were collecting we are trying to manage inventory closely to not either use or just not to eat up cash unnecessarily were delaying some purchases of spare parts were doing some other things just managing working capital but the tax refunds were waiting on amount to roughly  million so thats one lever that you may not consider significant that is probably more significant than most people imagine but thats pretty much itphilip h ng jefferies llc research division  equity analyst so that x leverage target whats the realistic goal and do you have to hit that leverage target before you reconsider looking at the dividend longerterm thats all i haverodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo no i would say not the dividend is up to the board and if they see free cash flow im sure theyll reconsider but the leverage ratio will not be dictating the dividend considerationoperator our next question is from louie toma with craighallum capital grouplouie m toma craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst just a couple of questions what kind of startup costs do you expect in qrodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo youre asking about amount or nature or both louielouie m toma craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst just to help us quantify dollars or margin impact just trying to handicap how q might be affected as the plant continues to come onlinerodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo theres probably another  million of type of  in our forecast for q for startup costs at barnwell the largest one is buying extravirgin fiber to make products prior to the recycled facility being fully operational with this delay in bringing up the mill or starting the mill well probably avoid some of that rampup cost that well be able to use more recycled paper from the beginning just because the timing of the  sections of the plant coming up will be more similar nowlouie m toma craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst got it okay and earlier you guys were talking about going after other bids and other business that you were looking at can you give us an update on that any new thing to report on those developmentsjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director well obviously were actively pursuing other business its improper for me to talk about where we are with that right now but except to say that we are investing heavily in brand developments right now were looking at the growth channels that are out there which include club stores supercenters and were putting a high focus on grocery because even though its a declining channel its still the largest channel so we have boots on the ground looking at all the different product channels with some potentially positive outcomes here in the next several monthslouie m toma craighallum capital group llc research division  senior research analyst got it and one last question so if you look at q  your gross margin was  as we get to the back half of the year and the new plant is up barnwell is up these  that you have right now with startup and inventory adjustments and things like that wont be a factor can you help us talk about the puts and takes that we can compare to that   that q margin of   in those quarters to what would make it high what would make it low how can we handicap that and how should we think about gross margin from that perspectivejeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director let me take a shot answering that lou i think its difficult to do that over the phone we probably ought to spend some more time on it but if you just think about selling prices per ton i do believe that the competitive nature of the market and the new business that we gained will be reflecting lower selling prices per ton so relative to q i would say the number is going to be lower however i would also say that our cost structure for the company when you include the barnwell startup the capabilities that were building there the fact that overhead adding a plant does not double relative to the existing facility i think our overall cost structure will mitigate a lot of those decreases in prices the other thing i think you can expect is the capabilities that weve built include ultrapremium and ultrapremium is a product that we are very focused on because it sells at a higher selling prices per ton which will actually raise the  our average selling price after it is impacted negatively because of getting volume but it also tends to give us better margins so from that perspective sales i think we can look at those several ways from a cost structure standpoint it really comes down to the efficiencies of our assets as we load them up now these types of assets run much better when theyre running longrun products fewer changeovers and the business that were layering in is basically highrun business its not adding  different customers doing changeovers every other hour type stuff its longrun so in that respect our cost structure should also get better over and above that there are cost management programs that we are working on currently weve been able to get raw material price reductions based on the new volume that were adding so relative to a year ago were able to leverage that down for us and over and above that we have other cost management programs that were working out that are not a function of volume but are a function of other things so those are the buckets and we can maybe talk more specifically about how those move as we move forwardrodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo louie ill repeat some guidance of sorts we gave last quarter which is our variable margin we believe is still  to  so were highly dependent on the volume of sales and it reflects a relatively low variable cost structure and having a fixed cost structure it also reflects inefficiencies and efficiencies that when we get  operate with lower volumes we have inefficiencies that flow through our variable cost margin and then at high levels we become more efficient so youve got this  to  range on the variable contribution margin and so it is just very sensitive to volumeoperator our next question is from john nobile with taglich brothersjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst id just like to know how much of the newly won business mentioned earlier in the year might show up in the second quarter and does it still look like it would be a roughly  increase in converted product sales starting in the second halfjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director yes were starting to be shipped  well start shipping the product at the end of may so consider june a rampup period so id say if you took  looking at allin  of the quarter might be the right way to look at it as being allin the  going into the third quarter it should be fully implemented if the transitions get executed well by the customer and then looking forward the volume of business that weve got is based on current existing sales and this particular customer has plans if you will to grow their shares so in the event that that starts happening youll see incremental lift in the second half relative to the ramp that we currently have we expect all those things to happen so the answer to your question is yes we still expect this  improvement in volume that weve statedjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst okay so  of the quarter youll be allin roughly  to  a little over whatever  to expect and this is over last years third quarter correct and actually im thinking of it in tonnage of converted product a  boost roughly from this in the second quarterjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director yes i think we have to take a look honestly at third quarter fourth quarter first quarter performance and come up with what we believe is the right base so id have the pull back on that a little bit john because i dont yet  i think we have to look at some kind of a weighted average between the  quarters to be honest with youjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst okay and could you elaborate on the changing mix of products it was mentioned in the press release that it was lowering your average price per tonrodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo relative to the first quarter of  yes it was actually an increase in average price relative to the fourth quarter of  so it depends on thejohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst relative to the fourth quarter it was an average price increase but at the end of the first quarter it was lower correctrodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo correct it has to do with a combination of customers buying a mix of bathroom tissue versus towels a mix of who were paying freight for who were not paying freight for promotional activities during the period all of those affected there were no absolute price decreases we didnt go out and change prices to any customers at least anything significant so it isnt reflective of the move by orchids to decrease the prices it is just a mix impact a mix of customers mix of productsjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst so it shifted from bathroom tissue to towel or from towel the bathroom tissue the mixrodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo i didnt look at that closely in q in q it was a shift away from towel to  im sorry the other way it was a shift to towel we were selling more towels and less bathroom tissuejohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst okay i assume a higher average selling price per ton okay and the capitalization of interest will this end in the second quarter being barnwell should be just about completed and if so what should we expect in regard to quarterly interest payments going forward because i assume theres going to be  your debt will peak in the second quarterrodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo yes we will finish  we wont be capitalizing any interest after the barnwell project is completed so end of may end of june basically when we say were done and have completed it well stop capitalizing interest at that point right now our interest rate is effectively   day libor plus  margin based on our leverage ratio as of  so were paying about  on the total debtjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst okay so  when its not capitalized we should see showing up on the interest payment thererodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo that is correctjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst what it would be and actually  i need to apologize just one final question i wanted to make sure that i understand the total capacity and this is under assumption of barnwells new paper machine up and running by the end of this quarter and also with the fabrica included in the mix the total company current converted capacity what should we expect after qjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director our total of converted capacity based on the changes we made is in the range of  million casesjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst and what would that be in tonnagejeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director  tons approximately is what were capable of producingjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst okay so thats converted and the paperproducing parent roll capacity is whatjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director the parent roll capacity is the number i just stated  tons we actually have more converting capacity than we have parent roll capacity so we start hittingjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst i mean fabrica is obviously a converted product there so i just wanted to get an idea of your parent roll capacity right now to satisfy what your entire converted capacity should bejeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director i havent thought too much about that i think the  youre probably looking at  tons maybe of incremental parent rolls we have to go produce to sell out our capacityjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst  tons of converted incremental over where you are nowjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director no once you sell out the parent roll wed have to go buy another  tons to support the incremental excess capacity thats convertingjohn nobile taglich brothers inc research division  senior equity analyst okay so obviously youll be  all rightoperator operator instructions our next question comes from rob schwartz with cooper creekrobert schwartz cooper creek partners management llc  founder ceo managing member and portfolio manager just wanted to understand a little bit more about the longterm plan to get to the longterm ebitda target it seems like if youre able to execute and get there theres a great longterm opportunity here the question is is the balance sheet now close  the dividend cut firm enough to get you there and as i look at the third and fourth quarter when the covenant restrictions come back on its unclear to me whether this was enough and then looking at the balance sheet today and a pass towards the back half i just wanted to get your comments and sort of your longterm view and if you think there is  as you look towards that x leverage ratio just if you think you have enough flexibility to execute the strategy in the backhalfjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director well ill just add on to what rod said i mean were going to pull all the levers that we can from a cash management ebitda growth et cetera to drive this down it does not however mean that we wont be opportunistic to look at other things that are possible for us to explore at this time i think given the story i think given the growth that we expect there is an opportunity to do something outside of those areas which i cant really talk about right now but there are other things we can look atrobert schwartz cooper creek partners management llc  founder ceo managing member and portfolio manager okay and i guess just with the stock at  right now would you try as best you could to avoid equity at these levelsjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director always try to avoid equity thats not a question of what it is i mean again we need to take a look at what our longterm view is on the company the growth and whats the best way to finance it so that we can continue to increase shareholder value but not be in the position that we have been over the last several quartersrobert schwartz cooper creek partners management llc  founder ceo managing member and portfolio manager okay that makes senserodney d gloss orchids paper products company  cfo im not speaking for the board but sort of my own thoughts in terms of one of the reasons that it was prudent to cut the dividend was that thats a temporary measure that can be reversed if we went out and issued stock so that we couldve paid the dividend thats a permanent delusion to solve a temporary problem so one of the levers weve pulled was the dividend leverrobert schwartz cooper creek partners management llc  founder ceo managing member and portfolio manager and i fully understand that it just seems to me given the potential squishiness around covenant still now in q and q maybe given the damage to the stock today wouldve been  just wondering if this was the end of the process in terms of firming up the balance sheet for the longterm execution here or theres still more to come and when will that come and delaying it further and im just sort of thinking about those  dynamics thats all but i understand that positionoperator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jeff schoen for any closing remarksjeffrey s schoen orchids paper products company  ceo president and director well thank you everybody for listening as ive stated i believe this really is the bottom of the parabola the new business awards that weve gained will provide significant growth
