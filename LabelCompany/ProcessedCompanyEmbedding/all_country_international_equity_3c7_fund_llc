return    as of    investment approach the fund combines three sources of potential return bottomup stock and industry selection topdown country selection and topdown currency selection  we start by developing a ranking for each stock in the investable universe using a disciplined systematic approach to analyze a wide variety of factors based on the underlying philosophy of value and momentum we then develop an independent view of the attractiveness of countries and currencies as an overlay to the selection of individual stocks   we combine these rankings into a portfolio that takes into account trading costs and liquidity considerations and rebalance in a manner that seeks to create a balance between keeping the portfolio in line with the ideal desired portfolio and the need to minimize trading costs  trades are primarily executed in a highly automated and liquidityproviding manner to seek to reduce the total cost of trading aqr international equity fund the fund uses
