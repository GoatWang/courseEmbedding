tidelands royalty trust b the trust is a royalty trust that was created on june   under the laws of the state of texas the trust is not permitted to engage in any business activity because it was organized for the sole purpose of providing an efficient orderly and practical means for the administration and liquidation of rights to interests in certain oil natural gas or other mineral leases obtained by gulf oil corporation gulf in a designated area of the gulf of mexico these rights are evidenced by a contract between the trusts predecessors and gulf dated april   the  contract which is binding upon the assignees of gulf as a result of various transactions that have occurred since  the gulf interests that were subject to the  contract now are held by chevron usa inc chevron which is a subsidiary of chevron corporation and its respective assignees the tidelands royalty trust b indenture effective june   as amended the indenture provides that the corporate trustee is to distribute all cash in the trust excluding cash retained by its subsidiary less an amount reserved for the payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses to unitholders of record on the last business day of march june september and december of each year pursuant to the terms of the indenture all distributions will be sent within  calendar days of the record date the indenture prohibits the operation of any kind of trade or business by the trust the indenture provides that the term of the trust will expire on april   unless extended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of beneficial interest southwest bank has served as corporate trustee of the trust since may   previously us trust bank of america private wealth management served as the trusts corporate trustee the trusts whollyowned subsidiary tidelands royalty b corporation tidelands corporation collectively with the trust tidelands holds title to interests in properties subject to the  contract that are situated offshore of louisiana ninetyfive percent of all oil natural gas and other mineral royalties collected by tidelands corporation less the cost of receiving and collecting are retained by and delivered to the trust tidelands corporation retains the remaining  of the overriding royalties along with other items of income and expense until such time as the board of directors declares a dividend out of retained earnings tidelands corporation like the trust is prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and does only those things necessary for the administration and liquidation of its properties tidelands only industry segment or purpose is the administration and collection of royalties the  contract  the  contract identifies  specific tracts the tracts in the gulf of mexico the tracts are not all the same size and collectively contain approximately  acres prior to the expiration of the year lease acquisition period on april   the acquisition expiration date if chevron or its assignees had acquired a lease or leases on one of the tracts and if oil or natural gas were produced and sold from any such tract then chevron or its assignees had to make production payments to tidelands in an amount equal to approximately  of the value at the wellhead of the oil and natural gas subject to such lease until the sum of  was paid to tidelands under the lease the  production payment was paid on five leases thereafter tidelands interest in such tracts converted to an overriding royalty as described below as described below five of the tracts had leases and rights to the other  tracts expired at the acquisition expiration date one of the five leases on galveston area block  terminated in  due to lack of production from the wells on the lease as of march   tidelands had an overriding royalty interest in four oil and natural gas leases covering  gross acres in the gulf of mexico in the sabine pass and west cameron areas collectively the royalty area as of march   all four of tidelands assigned leases contained active wells tidelands overriding royalty interest on three of the four current leases is  on the fourth lease the overriding royalty interest is  the overriding royalty interest on the fourth lease is lower because chevron only acquired a  working interest in the lease    table of contents since the acquisition expiration date has passed chevron and its assignees are no longer obligated to assign any interest to tidelands out of any lease that they acquire on any of the tracts tidelands will continue to be entitled to receive payments on four of the leases chevron or its assignees acquired prior to the acquisition expiration date so long as such leases are active properties the four

offshore inc has paid royalties for its  working interest on galveston block  since january  sterling energy inc and barron petroleum company who collectively own the remaining  of the working interest have not paid royalties to tidelands pending an agreement on which working interest owner is responsible for making payments as of may   the lease on galveston block  was terminated tidelands has not determined which party is responsible for these payments tidelands estimates that the royalties due from sterling energy inc and barron petroleum company would have totaled approximately  for   and  as of march   the trustee has not been able to successfully collect these funds  enven energy ventures llc is not a working interest owner of record but pays the royalties due to tidelands from west cameron block  production ceased on west cameron block  in july  but went back on stream in september  a suspension of production was granted through february  tidelands recently began receiving royalty payments from enven energy ventures llc for west cameron block  eni us operating co changed its name to enven energy ventures llc    table of contents tidelands derives no revenues from foreign sources and has no export sales trust functions  the trust is administered by officers and employees of the trustee the trust has no employees see item  directors executive officers and corporate governance all aspects of tidelands operations are conducted by third parties these operations include the production and sale of oil and natural gas and the calculation of royalty payments to tidelands which are conducted by oil and natural gas companies that lease tracts subject to tidelands interests american stock transfer and trust company llc is the transfer agent for tidelands and is responsible for reviewing processing and paying distributions the ability of tidelands to receive revenues is entirely dependent upon its entitlement to its rights with respect to the four leases held by chevron and its assignees in the gulf of mexico as more fully described in item  properties below the royalty interests held by tidelands are depleting with each barrel bbl of oil and thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas produced no funds are reinvested by tidelands thus these depleting assets are not being replaced widely held fixed investment trust reporting information the trustee assumes that some units of beneficial interest are held by middlemen as such term is broadly defined in us treasury regulations and includes custodians nominees certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name therefore the trustee considers the trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust whfit for us federal income tax purposes accordingly the trust will provide tax information in accordance with applicable us treasury regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the trust as a whfit the representative of the trust that will provide the required information is the trustee and the contact information for the representative is as follows southwest bank  turtle creek blvd suite  dallas texas  telephone number   each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor for tax reporting matters item a risk factors although various risk factors and specific cautionary statements are described elsewhere in this annual report on form k the following is a summary of the principal risks associated with the trust and an investment in units of the trust    table of contents tidelands is unable to acquire royalty interests in any more leases chevron and its assignees are no longer obligated to assign any interest to tidelands out of any lease that they acquire on any of the tracts in addition tidelands is not permitted to carry on any business including making investments in additional oil and natural gas interests tidelands will continue to be entitled to receive payments on four of the leases acquired by chevron or its assignees prior to the acquisition expiration date so long as the leases exist and such leases contain active wells once the leases terminate or expire any overriding royalties payable to tidelands terminate and tidelands cannot acquire any additional or replacement royalty interests for example one of the original five leases acquired by chevron or its assignees terminated in may  royalty interests are depleting assets and may deplete faster than expected or in their entirety the net proceeds payable to tidelands are derived from the sale of depleting assets accordingly the portion of the distributions to unitholders that are attributable to depletion may be considered a return of capital as opposed to a return on investment distributions that are considered a return of capital will ultimately diminish the depletion tax benefits available to unitholders which could reduce the market value of the units over time the reduction in proved reserve quantities is a common measure of depletion future maintenance and development projects in the royalty area will likely affect the quantity of proved reserves the timing and size of these projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas if operators of the royalty area do not implement additional maintenance and development projects the future rate of production decline of proved reserves may be higher than the rate currently experienced by tidelands eventually the properties in the royalty area will stop producing in commercial quantities and tidelands leases in the royalty area will terminate or expire and tidelands will no longer receive any distributions of net proceeds or overriding royalty interest payments oil and natural gas prices are volatile and fluctuate due to a number of factors and lower prices will reduce royalty payments to tidelands and distributions to its unitholders tidelands quarterly distributions are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of oil and natural gas a significant downward movement in the prices for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on tidelands distributable income which could decrease the distributions to unitholders and the market price for the units historically prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to factors beyond tidelands control these factors include but are not limited to        political conditions worldwide in particular political disruption terrorist activities war or other armed conflicts in oil producing regions especially in the middle east        worldwide economic conditions        weather conditions        the supply and price of domestic and foreign oil and natural gas        the level of consumer demand        the price and availability of alternative fuels        the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities and        the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures moreover government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls can affect oil and natural gas product prices in the long term lower prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economical to produce and reduce distributable income available to tidelands for example tidelands was unable to make a distribution to unitholders in the second and third quarters of  due to a decrease in production and prices of oil and natural gas among other things the volatility of oil and gas prices reduces the predictability of future cash distributions to unitholders substantially all of the oil and natural gas produced from the royalty area is being sold under shortterm or multimonth contracts at market clearing prices or on the spot market    table of contents the market price for the units may not reflect the value of the royalty interests held by tidelands the public trading price for the units tends to be tied to the recent and expected levels of cash distributions on the units the amounts available for distribution by tidelands vary in response to numerous factors outside of tidelands control including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas produced from properties in the royalty area the market price of the units is not necessarily indicative of the value that tidelands would realize if it sold its interest in the properties in the royalty area to a third party and distributed the net proceeds to its unitholders in addition the market price of the units is not necessarily reflective of the fact that tidelands assets are depleting assets and a portion of each cash distribution paid on the units should be considered by investors as a return of capital with the remainder being considered as a return on investment there is no guarantee that distributions made to a unitholder over the life of these depleting assets will equal or exceed the purchase price paid by the unitholder for the unit in addition the public stock markets have traditionally experienced price and trading volume volatility this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons that may or may not be related to operating performance if the public stock markets continue to experience price and trading volume volatility in the future the market price of the units could be adversely affected our units have been thinly traded and an active trading market for our units may not develop the trading volume of our units has historically been low partially because our units are only traded on the otcqb in addition our public float has been further limited because approximately  of our units were owned by marine petroleum trust marine as of march   as a result sales of small amounts of the units in the public market could cause the price of the units to fluctuate greatly including in a materially adverse manner in addition a more active trading market for our units may not develop or if it does develop may not continue and a unitholder may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our units operating risks for the working interest owners interests in the royalty area can adversely affect distributions the occurrence of drilling production or transportation accidents and other natural disasters in the royalty area can reduce distributions these occurrences include blowouts cratering explosions environmental and hurricane damage that may result in personal injuries property damage damage to productive formations or equipment and environmental damages any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the amount of our distributions or the market value of the units failure to collect royalty payments from working interest owners could adversely affect tidelands distributions to its unitholders a significant portion of tidelands royalties are attributable to a limited number of working interest owners during  renaissance offshore llc and fieldwood energy llc accounted for approximately  and  of the royalty payments to tidelands respectively tidelands does not require working interest owners to pledge collateral or otherwise post security for royalty payments tidelands has encountered and may in the future encounter collection issues with one or more of the working interest owners at any time which could result in tidelands not receiving payment for some or all of its royalty interests any reduction in royalty payments would reduce tidelands distributable income to unitholders for example since january  sterling energy inc and barron petroleum company who collectively own  of the working interest on galveston block  have not paid royalties to tidelands pending an agreement on which working interest owner is responsible for making the payments tidelands estimates that the royalties due from sterling energy inc and barron petroleum company would have totaled approximately  for   and  as of march   the trustee has not been able to successfully collect these funds the owner of any properties in the royalty area may transfer any of the properties in the royalty area to another unrelated third party which could reduce the amount of royalty payments that are received the working interest owners may at any time transfer all or part of the properties in the royalty area to another unrelated third party unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer and tidelands will not receive any proceeds of any such transfer following any transfer the royalty area will continue to be subject to tidelands royalty interest but the net proceeds from the transferred property would be calculated separately and paid by the transferee the transferee would be responsible for all of the obligations relating to calculating reporting and    table of contents paying to tidelands its royalty interest on the transferred portion of the royalty area and the transferor of the transferred property in the royalty area would have no continuing obligation to tidelands for the property any such transferee may not be as financially sound as the current working interest owner the owner of any properties in the royalty area may abandon any property terminating the related royalty interest tidelands may hold the current working interest owners or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities or for any other reason this would terminate tidelands royalty interest relating to the abandoned well or property the trustee tidelands and the trusts unitholders do not control the operation or development of the properties in the royalty area and have little influence over operation or development the trustee tidelands and the trusts unitholders have little if any influence or control over the operation or future development of the underlying properties in the royalty area the properties in the royalty area are owned by independent working interest owners the working interest owners manage the underlying properties and handle the receipt and payment of funds relating to the royalty area and payments to tidelands for its royalty interests the current working interest owners are under no obligation to continue operating the properties the failure of a working interest owner to conduct its operations discharge its obligations cooperate with regulatory agencies or comply with laws rules and regulations in a proper manner could have an adverse effect on net proceeds payable to tidelands the trustee tidelands and the trusts unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator important reserve and other information with respect to the particular leases subject to tidelands royalty interest is unreasonably difficult to obtain the leasehold working interests that are subject to the rights held by tidelands were owned in whole or in part by chevron and have been assigned to other oil and natural gas exploration and production companies certain information with respect to the particular leases subject to tidelands interests including but not limited to i reserves ii availability of oil and natural gas iii average production cost lifting cost per unit iv undeveloped acreage and v net wells and net acres lies solely within the knowledge of these working interest owners tidelands does not have access to engineering data regarding these leaseholds and believes such information would have been compiled principally by or for the working interest owners of these leaseholds and such information is unreasonably difficult for tidelands to obtain terrorism and continued geopolitical hostilities could adversely affect tidelands distributions to its unitholders or the market price of its units terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks whether domestic or foreign as well as military or other actions taken in response to such attacks or threats could cause instability in the global financial oil and natural gas markets terrorism and other geopolitical hostilities could adversely affect the trusts distributions to its unitholders or the market price of its units in unpredictable ways including through the disruption of oil and natural gas supplies and markets increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which the operators of the underlying properties rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terror unitholders have limited voting rights voting rights as a unitholder are more limited than those of stockholders of most public corporations for example there is no requirement for annual meetings of unitholders or for an annual or other periodic reelection of the trustee unlike corporations which are generally governed by boards of directors that are elected by their equity holders the trust is administered by a corporate trustee in accordance with the indenture and other organizational documents the trustee has extremely limited discretion in its administration of the trust    table of contents the limited liability of the unitholders is uncertain the unitholders are not protected from the liabilities of the trust to the same extent that a shareholder would be protected from a corporations liabilities the structure of the trust as a trust does not include the interposition of a limited liability entity such as a corporation or limited partnership which would provide further limited liability protection to unitholders while the trust is liable for any excess liabilities incurred if the trustee fails to ensure that such liabilities are to be satisfied only out of the trusts assets under the laws of the state of texas which are unsettled on this point a unitholder may be jointly and severally liable for any liability of the trust if i the satisfaction of such liabilities was not contractually limited to the assets of the trust and ii the assets of the trust and the trustee are not adequate to satisfy such liability as a result unitholders may be exposed to personal liability tidelands royalty interest can be sold and the trust can be terminated the trust may be terminated and the trustee may sell tidelands royalty interests if holders of  or more of the units of beneficial interest of the trust approve the sale and vote to terminate the trust following any such termination and liquidation the net proceeds of any sale would be distributed to the unitholders and the unitholders would receive no further distributions from the trust any such sale may not be on terms acceptable or favorable to all unitholders the operators of the oil and natural gas leases are subject to extensive governmental regulation oil and natural gas operators have been and in the future will be affected by federal state and local laws and regulations and other political developments such as price or gathering rate controls drilling regulations and environmental protection regulations including the regulation of hydraulic fracturing although tidelands is unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact royalty interests cash held by the trustee is not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation currently cash held by tidelands reserved for the payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses and distributions to unitholders is typically held in cash deposits us treasury and agency bonds and money market accounts tidelands places such reserve cash with financial institutions that tidelands considers creditworthy and limits the amount of credit exposure from any one financial institution however none of these accounts are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation in the event that any such financial institution becomes insolvent tidelands may be unable to recover any or all such cash from the insolvent financial institution any loss of such cash may have a material adverse effect on tidelands cash balances and any distributions to unitholders financial information of tidelands is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the financial statements of tidelands are prepared on a modified cash basis of accounting which is a comprehensive basis of accounting that differs from generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap although this basis of accounting is permitted for royalty trusts by the us securities and exchange commission the sec the financial statements of tidelands differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap because royalty income is recognized in the month it is received rather than in the month of production expenses are recorded in the month paid rather than in the month incurred and reserves may be established for contingencies that would not be recorded under gaap    table of contents if tidelands becomes subject to the texas franchise tax the trustee may have to withhold amounts from future distributions to pay the tax liability in may  the state of texas enacted legislation as amended to implement a franchise or margin tax certain entities that were previously exempt from the franchise tax including many trusts are now subject to the tax trusts however other than business trusts as defined in us treasury regulation section b that meet certain statutory requirements are exempt from the franchise tax as passive entities the trustee does not expect that the trust will be required to pay any amounts under the texas state franchise tax for the  tax year based on the trustees belief that the trust is exempt from the franchise tax as a passive entity  ie  the trust is not a business trust it receives at least  of its federal gross income from certain passive sources and no more than  of its income is derived from an active trade or business if it is subsequently determined that the trust is not exempt from the franchise tax the trust will be required to deduct and withhold from future distributions the amount required to satisfy and pay the trusts franchise tax liability for years for which the applicable statute of limitations has not yet expired in addition the trust would be required to timely pay franchise tax liability due with respect to current and future years if the trust is exempt from the texas state franchise tax as a passive entity each unitholder that is subject to the texas franchise tax as a taxable entity under the texas tax code should generally include its share of the trusts revenue in its franchise tax computation the texas franchise tax does not apply to natural persons each unitholder is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding its possible texas state franchise

financial statements of tidelands are prepared on the modified cash basis method and are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity with gaap under the modified cash basis method        royalty income is recognized when received by tidelands        tidelands expenses which include accounting legal and other professional fees trustees fees and outofpocket expenses are recorded on an actual paid basis reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain in amount may also be established if considered necessary        distributions to unitholders are recognized when declared by the trustee of the trust the financial statements of tidelands differ from financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap because of the following        royalty income is recognized in the month received rather than in the month of production        reserves may be established for contingencies that would not be recorded under gaap        expenses are recorded in the month paid rather than in the month incurred this comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles permitted for royalty trusts by the sec as specified by staff accounting bulletin topic e financial statements of royalty trusts  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with the modified cash basis method of accounting requires the trustee to make various estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period actual amounts may differ from such estimates on january   us trust bank of america private wealth management gave notice to tidelands unitholders that it would be resigning as trustee of the trust subject to among other conditions the appointment of southwest bank as successor trustee at a special meeting of tidelands unitholders on may   southwest bank was appointed as successor trustee and such appointment became effective on may   results of operations  tidelands revenues are derived from the oil and natural gas production activities of unrelated parties tidelands revenues and distributions fluctuate from period to period based upon factors beyond tidelands control including without limitation the number of leases subject to tidelands interests the number of productive wells drilled on leases subject to tidelands interests the level of production over time from such wells and the prices at which the oil and natural gas from such wells are sold tidelands results of operations are significantly impacted by oil and natural gas commodity prices and the quantity of oil and natural gas production oil and natural gas prices have historically experienced significant volatility tidelands is not permitted to manage its commodity price risk through the use of fixed price contracts or financial derivatives tidelands income consists primarily of oil and natural gas royalties and is based on the value at the well of tidelands percentage interest in oil and natural gas sold without reduction for any of the production expenses value at the well for oil means the purchasers selling price at its receiving point onshore less the cost of transportation from the offshore lease to the onshore receiving point value at the well for natural gas means the selling price less the cost of compression dehydration and transportation from the lease to the delivery point of the pipeline transporting the product to market in general value at the well is determined on the basis of the selling price of oil natural gas and other minerals produced saved and sold or at wellhead prices determined by industry standards where the selling price does not reflect value at the well in the event an agreement is not armslength in nature the value is based upon current market prices    table of contents summary review in general tidelands receives royalties two months after oil production and three months after natural gas production the distribution to be paid in april  will be based upon royalty receipts received in december  and january and february  from

general and administrative expenses were  in  a decrease from  for  this decrease was primarily due to decreased costs associated with professional fees associated with the transition resulting from southwest banks appointment as trustee and costs incurred for the transition in the prior year which were one time transition costs that are no longer being incurred capital resources and liquidity the trusts indenture and the charter and bylaws of tidelands corporation expressly prohibits the operation of any kind of trade or business due to the limited purpose of the trust as stated in the trusts indenture there is no requirement for capital the trusts only obligation is to distribute all cash in the trust excluding cash retained by its subsidiary less an amount reserved for the payment of accrued liabilities and estimate future expenses as an administrator of oil and natural gas royalty properties tidelands collects income monthly pays expenses of administration and disburses all distributable income collected to its unitholders each quarter because all of tidelands revenues are invested in liquid funds pending distribution tidelands does not experience liquidity problems the trusts oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets and are not being replaced due to the prohibition against these investments these restrictions along with other factors allow the trust to be treated as a nontaxable grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes accordingly all of tidelands income and deductions should flow through to its unitholders on a proportionate basis the trust is not a taxable entity tidelands corporation will owe state and us federal income taxes with respect to its income after deducting statutory depletion tidelands

because of factors risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following reductions in price or demand for oil and natural gas which might then lead to decreased production or impair tidelands ability to make distributions reductions in production due to the depletion of existing wells or disruptions in service which may be caused by storm damage to production facilities blowouts or other production accidents or geological changes such as cratering of productive formations changes in regulations and the expiration or release of leases subject to tidelands interests events may

                         see accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements    table of contents tidelands royalty trust b and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements december        summary of significant accounting policies and general     a general tidelands royalty trust b the trust was established on june   with a transfer of contract rights to certain properties to the trust in exchange for units of beneficial interest the contract rights enable the trust to receive an interest in any oil natural gas or other mineral leases obtained by gulf oil corporation now chevron usa inc chevron which is a subsidiary of chevron corporation and its assignees in a designated area of the gulf of mexico during a year period that expired on april   the trust is required under its indenture to distribute all income after paying its liabilities and obligations to the unitholders quarterly the trust cannot invest any of its money for any purpose and cannot engage in a trade or business the trusts whollyowned subsidiary tidelands royalty b corporation tidelands corporation holds title to interests in properties that are situated offshore of louisiana ninetyfive percent of all oil natural gas and other mineral royalties collected by this subsidiary are retained by and delivered to the trust tidelands corporation like the trust is prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and does only those things necessary for the administration and liquidation of its properties the trust is authorized to pay the expenses of tidelands corporation should it be necessary the trust and its subsidiary have no employees tidelands corporation has entered into an arrangement with marine petroleum corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of marine petroleum trust an affiliate of the trust to share certain administrative expenses related to the use of office space that was leased through april   and to assist the trustee in the administration of the trust for the years ended december    and  tidelands corporation paid   and  respectively to marine petroleum corporation as reimbursement for the use of such office space at december   and  marine petroleum trust owned  of the trusts outstanding units of beneficial interest     b unitholder voting matters on march   the unitholders of record at the close of business on february   approved an amendment to the indenture to extend the term of the trust to april       c principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the trust and its whollyowned subsidiary tidelands corporation all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation     d producing oil and natural gas properties at the time the trust was established no determinable market value was available for the assets transferred to the trust consequently nominal values were assigned accordingly no allowance for depletion has been included tidelands revenues are derived from production payments and overriding royalty interests related to properties located in the gulf of mexico    table of contents   e us federal income taxes no provision has been made for us federal income taxes on the trusts income since such taxes are the liability of the unitholders us federal income taxes are provided on the income of tidelands corporation which specifically excludes the  net profits interest to be retained by and delivered to the trust after deducting statutory depletion there were no significant deferred tax assets or liabilities as of december   and  tidelands corporation uses the cash method of reporting for federal income taxes the primary difference between the actual tax expense of tidelands corporation and the expected tax expense is due to the fact that only  of tidelands corporations income ie excluding the  net profits interest retained by and delivered to the trust is subject to us federal income tax tax positions taken by the trust related to the trusts passthrough status and federal state tax positions have been reviewed and the trustee is of the opinion that material positions taken would more likely than not be sustained by examination in accordance with the trusts basis of accounting discussed in note  the trust would only recognize the impact of tax positions that were not upheld at the time of payment as of december   the trusts tax years  and thereafter remain subject to examination tidelands corporation recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense     f credit risk concentration and cash equivalents financial instruments which potentially subject the trust and tidelands corporation to concentrations of credit risk are primarily investments in cash equivalents the trust and tidelands corporation place their cash investments with financial institutions that the trustee considers creditworthy and limit the amount of credit exposure from any one financial institution the estimated fair values of cash equivalents approximate the carrying values due to the short term nature of these financial instruments tidelands had cash and cash equivalents of  and  at december   and  respectively which consisted of cash deposits us treasury and agency bonds and money market accounts     g use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with the modified cash basis method of accounting requires the trustee to make various estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from such estimates     h distributable income per unit distributable income per unit is determined by dividing distributable income by the number of units of beneficial interest outstanding during the period     i significant royalty sources    table of contents the following table presents the approximate percentage of royalties actually received from each royalty payor for the past three years   royalty payors

operating co inc                                                                                                      basis of accounting the financial statements of tidelands have been prepared on the modified cash basis method and are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap under the modified cash basis method        royalty income is recognized when received by tidelands        tidelands expenses which include accounting legal and other professional fees trustees fees and outofpocket expenses are recorded on an actual paid basis reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain in amount may also be established if considered necessary        distributions to unitholders are recognized when declared by the trustee of the trust the financial statements of tidelands differ from financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap because of the following        royalty income is recognized in the month received rather than in the month of production        reserves may be established for contingencies that would not be recorded under gaap        expenses are recorded in the month paid rather than in the month incurred this comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles permitted for royalty trusts by the sec as specified by staff accounting bulletin topic e financial statements of royalty trusts       texas franchise tax texas imposes a franchise tax that applies to most business entities that are formed or qualified to do business or that are otherwise doing business in texas under the texas franchise tax statute a  tax in certain cases not applicable here the tax rate is  is imposed for reports due in  on each taxable entitys taxable margin that is apportioned to texas taxable margin is generally defined as revenues less certain costs as provided under the statute most entities that provide owners with limited liability protection including trusts are considered to be taxable entities for purposes of the texas franchise tax the statute provides certain limited exemptions from the tax including exclusions for certain passive entities that satisfy specified statutory requirements as described below under the texas franchise tax statute passive entities including trusts that meet the following requirements are exempt from the texas franchise tax a the trust cannot be a business trust within the meaning of us treasury regulation section b b at least  of the trusts income for the taxable year must be derived from passive sources eg royalties bonuses delay rental income from mineral properties dividends interest gains from the sale of securities and c no more than  of the trusts income for the taxable year can be derived from an active trade or business eg rent certain income received by a nonoperator under a joint operating agreement pursuant to which the operator is the member of an affiliated group that includes such nonoperator an entity will determine on an annual basis whether it meets the requirements to be treated as a passive entity for texas franchise tax purposes the trustee believes that all or substantially all of the income of the trust currently is passive as it consists of royalty income from the sale of oil and natural gas dividends and interest income subject to any change in the sources of income derived by the trust or any change in the indenture the trust expects that it will continue to qualify as a passive entity that is not subject to the franchise tax    table of contents if the trust is exempt from the texas franchise tax as a passive entity each unitholder that is subject to the texas franchise tax as a taxable entity under the texas tax code should generally include its share of the trusts revenue in its franchise tax computation the texas franchise tax does not apply to natural persons the trust anticipates that it will be a passive entity in the tax year ending in       supplemental information relating to oil and natural gas reserves unaudited oil and natural gas reserve information
