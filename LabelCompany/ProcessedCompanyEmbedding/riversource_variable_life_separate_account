class  shares of the evergreen va international equity fund of the evergreen variable annuity trust  the applicants represent that each of the replacement portfolios has substantially similar investment objectives principal investment strategies and risk characteristics to those of its corresponding substituted portfolio as stated in their respective prospectuses andor statements of additional information “sai” and as set out in the application  the applicants represent that each of the replacement portfolios total net operating expenses and aggregate investment management fees and b fees for the year ended december   expressed as an annual percentage of average daily net assets are no higher than those of its corresponding substituted portfolio except for the threadneedle vp—emerging markets fund which has slightly higher total net operating expenses than the ftvipt templeton developing markets securities fund class  as set forth in the following chart start printed page  start printed page  start printed page   applicants represent that the substitutions proposed herein are part of an overall business goal of the companies to make the contracts more attractive to contract owners by providing a diverse array of investment options that are neither redundant nor duplicative in terms of the investment types and styles of the mutual funds underlying such options the companies believe that a more concentrated and streamlined array of investment options could result in increased operational and administrative efficiencies and economies of scale for the companies the companies also believe that contracts that offer too many similar investment options may be unnecessarily confusing to contract owners and may increase the companies costs of administering the contracts  applicants represent that the companies chose the replacement portfolios with the goal of ensuring that contract owners would be provided with similar investment options under their contracts following the substitutions based on an analysis of investment objectives strategies risks performance fees and expenses  applicants represent that for all but one substitution the expense ratio of the replacement portfolio is lower than that of the corresponding substituted portfolio applicants also represent that for a vast majority of the start printed page substitutions the replacement portfolio is larger than or of a comparable size to the corresponding substituted portfolio applicants note that a high level of assets means various fund costs such as legal accounting printing and trustee fees are spread over a larger base with each contract owner potentially bearing a smaller portion of the cost than would be the case if the replacement portfolio were smaller in size applicants also note that for many of the replacement portfolios assets will increase as a result of the substitutions in some cases significantly and thus it is anticipated that with such an increase operating expenses will decrease  ultimately given all of the factors discussed above the companies concluded that the substituted portfolios offered under the contracts warranted replacement accordingly the applicants seek the commissions approval under section c to engage in the substitution transactions described below  the companies will effect the substitutions following the issuance of the requested order as follows as of the effective date of the substitutions “effective date” each separate account will either redeem shares of the applicable substituted portfolios inkind or the substituted portfolios will liquidate portfolio securities as necessary and shares of the replacement portfolio will be purchased with cash in either event the proceeds of such redemptions will then be used to purchase shares of the corresponding class of the replacement portfolio with each subaccount of the applicable separate account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the substituted portfolios in the applicable class of the replacement portfolio  redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times all redemptions of shares of the substituted portfolios and purchases of shares of the replacement portfolio will be effected in accordance with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder  the substitutions will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in any of the subaccounts contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the substitutions nor will their rights or the companies obligations under the contracts be altered in any way and the substitutions will not change contract owners insurance benefits under the contracts all expenses incurred in connection with the substitutions including legal accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage commissions will be paid by riversource life or riversource life of ny in addition the substitutions will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the substitutions than before the substitutions neither riversource life nor riversource life of ny will exercise any right it may have under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the contracts for a period of at least thirty  days following the substitutions the only exception to this would be restrictions that riversource life or riversource life of ny may impose to prevent or restrict “market timing” activities by contract owners or their agents  the companies represent that with respect to contracts outstanding on the effective date the companies will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the effective date the subaccounts investing in each applicable replacement portfolio to the extent that the sum of the replacement portfolios net operating expenses taking into account any expense waiver or reimbursement and the separate account expenses for such period exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the corresponding substituted portfolios net operating expenses taking into account any expense waiver or reimbursement and the separate account expenses for the fiscal year ended december   in addition for twentyfour months following the effective date the companies will not increase assetbased fees or charges for contracts outstanding on the effective date  applicants represent that the procedures to be implemented are sufficient to assure that each contract owners cash values immediately after the substitutions shall be equal to the cash value immediately before the substitutions  applicants represent that under the manager of managers order applicable to the riversource funds a vote of the shareholders is not necessary to change a subadviser of the applicable replacement portfolio except for changes involving an affiliated subadviser notwithstanding after the effective date of the substitutions the applicants agree not to change the replacement portfolios subadviser add a new subadviser or otherwise rely on the manager of managers order without first obtaining shareholder approval of either the subadviser change or the replacement portfolios continued ability to rely on the manager of managers order  applicants note that contract owners were notified of the initial application by means of a prospectus supplement for each of the contracts stating that the applicants filed the initial application and seek approval for the substitutions “presubstitution notice” the presubstitution notice set forth the anticipated effective date and advised contract owners that contract values attributable to investments in the substituted portfolios will be transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge on the effective date the presubstitution notice stated that from the date the initial application was filed with the commission through the date thirty  days after the substitutions contract owners may make one transfer of contract value from the subaccounts investing in the substituted portfolios before the substitutions or the replacement portfolio after the substitutions to one or more other subaccounts without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without that transfer counting against their contractual transfer limitations  applicants represent that all contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent replacement portfolio prospectus prior to the substitutions  applicants represent that within five  days following the substitutions contract owners affected by the substitutions will be notified in writing that the substitutions were carried out this notice will restate the information set forth in the presubstitution notice applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act formerly section b prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the commission section c provides that such approval shall be granted by order of the commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of start printed page investors and the purposes of the  act  section c was intended to provide for commission scrutiny of proposed substitutions which could in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holders only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security or to elect a costly and in effect forced redemption for the reasons described below the applicants submit that the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and that if implemented the substitutions would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include this provision in addition the applicants submit that the proposed substitutions meet the standards that the commission and its staff have applied to substitutions that have been approved in the past  the replacement of the substituted portfolios with the replacement portfolio is consistent with the protection of contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and thus meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to section c of the  act  although not always identical the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the replacement portfolio are substantially similar to those of the corresponding substituted portfolio  the total operating expenses prior to expense waivers and reimbursements of the applicable class of the replacement portfolios were lower than those of the corresponding substituted portfolio as a december   except for the threadneedle vp—emerging markets fund which has slightly higher total net operating expenses than the ftvipt templeton developing markets securities fund class  for a twoyear period following the date of the substitutions the companies will ensure that total net operating expenses of the applicable class of all replacement portfolios together with separate account expenses will not exceed on an annualized basis the total net operating expenses of the corresponding substituted portfolio together with separate account expenses as of december    applicants request an order of the commission pursuant to section c of the  act approving the substitutions the applicants submit that for all the reasons stated above the substitutions are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy of the contracts and provisions of the  act  the section b applicants also request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit riversource life or riversource life of ny to carry out the substitutions by redeeming shares issued by the substituted portfolios inkind and using the distributed securities to purchase shares issued by the applicable replacement portfolios  section al and a of the  act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company and from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company as described below riversource life and riversource life of ny anticipate that the substitutions will be done in whole or in part by redeeming shares of the substituted portfolios inkind rather than in cash and then using those assets to purchase shares of the replacement portfolio redemptions and purchases inkind involve the purchase of property from a registered investment company and the sale of property to a registered investment company by riversource life riversource life of ny and riversource funds each arguably an affiliated person of those investment companies  pursuant to section a of the  act the section b applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the replacement portfolios involved in such substitutions based upon the definition of “affiliated person” under section a of the  act in addition to the companies affiliation with each replacement portfolio of the riversource funds the companies through their separate accounts in the aggregate own  or more of the outstanding shares of the following replacement portfolios alliancebernstein vps international value portfolio and evergreen va international equity fund therefore arguably each company is an affiliated person of these replacement portfolios because the substitutions involving these replacement portfolios and the replacement portfolios of the riversource funds may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and also by means of inkind transactions these substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that  the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned  the proposed transaction is
