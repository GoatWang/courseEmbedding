sell  of the total offering size doofl mgmt sold  of the offering could this mean that the trust in doofl mgmt is high the average offering amount for companies in the other technology industry is

as reasons for the financing this could help competitors entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer why fundraising reporting is good for doofl mgmt also despite thomas e decareau’s reporting disadvantages doofl mgmt inc could benefit from this reporting first it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed the odds are higher that it will stay in the business second this could attract other investors such as venturecapital firms funds and angels third positive pr effects could even bring
