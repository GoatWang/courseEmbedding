decades ago for the selfdescribed “completely dedicated senior vice president and chief financial officer of the company which boasted a revenue topping  billion in  according to forbes latest report and even though robillard has  billion reasons to stay awake at night he remembers one simple task make sure hunt consolidated never runs out of money “i never let that get too far from the forefront of my mind he said “without cash or liquidity a company goes out of business how did you get into your industry every meal ive ever eaten came out of the oil business i started with hunt consolidated andahalf years ago when it was a very different company it was much smaller back then but it has grown exponentially over the years in  it was a tough job market but i had two job offers within  days i got a call from the controller from hunt oil co and they said they needed someone to run the accounting for an international company hunt oil is a legendary company and is part of texas history describe an experience that shaped your future when i was hired the oil industry was in a downturn we were just gearing up for operations in yemen and i volunteered to go there for two years when i got there they tested the discovery well and i ended up staying there almost nine years i held a number of jobs ray hunt was either training me or testing me in the time i was there we drilled  wells and laid down  miles of pipeline over two mountain ranges it gave me a real sense of accomplishment we were producing almost a quarterofamillion barrels of oil a day those are onceinalifetime experiences what has been your biggest accomplishment in the past year we do a lot of things here but investing  million in perus local bond market was one of the largest if not the largest bond deals in the country we have a lot of money invested in peru and this allowed us to balance our assets around the world any plans to retire the hunt family hasnt given me any hints so far and i still get excited when i come to work here i dont know if ill ever completely retire ive saved money but i enjoy working it gives me a sense of accomplishment robillard donald f jr top holdings whalewisdom
