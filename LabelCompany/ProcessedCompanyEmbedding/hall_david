family loves to bounce on it and after doing some reading about the health benefits i’m sold it’s fun it’s good for you and it came immediately it’s very easy to assemble or to fold and put away hester – january   i bought a cellerciser and am quite happy with it i have weak knees and my knees hurt when i walk even a short distance this rebounder is easy on the knees and works well with aerobic rebounding programs most people that know about rebounders consider the cellerciser to be the lexus of rebounders when you consider the cost of a decent treadmill or elliptical a quality rebounder such as the cellerciser is worth the extra money spent lilac – january   i’m a senior citizen who has owned my cellerciser for about eights months i carefully worked my way up to cellercising for  minutes in no time i saw improvement with a knee problem that caused me to limp whenever i sat for more than  minutes with the cellerciser i am able to exercise daily i did a lot of research before purchasing it and decided on the cellerciser because of the soft bounce the fact that it folds up and the balance bar in the s i owned a cheap rebounder that probably would have caused injury if i had used it a lot however it had such a hard bounce that i soon got rid of it the cellerciser was not inexpensive but worth every penny i love it maxava – february   i recently received my cellerciser halffold rebounder and was pleased that it was set up and ready to use within minutes of pulling it out of the box i’m enjoying using it every day and have decided to leave it set up permanently i do like that it is easily portable so i can take it with us whenever we do go a trip very happy with my purchase g birkner – february   this is an awesome product well made affordable and easy to use whether you are an accomplished athlete or can only walk with the aid of a cane cheaper rebounders can injure your body because of the jarring effect on your knees and back due to poor springs and allowing your feet to tip inward or pronate not on the cellerciser though it is the best rebounder on the market in my opinion i purchased mine about  months ago and have used it regularly every since following david hall’s cellercise program my overall health and well being are much better now every home should have one of these latasha l – february   i have a lot of exercise equipment this is by far the greatest piece i own easy to set up and travel with love that even when i have lower leg injuries that don’t allow for outdoor running i can always get a great workout on my
