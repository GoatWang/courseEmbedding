effective and is used in a standard surgical approach zlig addresses the risk of tissue rejection and is designed to create better results for the patient the acl the anterior cruciate ligament lives inside of your knee joint when the acl is torn it affects function of the knee limits movement and causes pain how zlig works   we take the safe tissues  animal tissue is harvested from iso certified facilities with the strongest attention to safety and quality   and strip them of antigens that cause rejection tissue is chemically processed alphagalactosidase enzyme is used to remove the key carbohydrate responsible for acute rejection  after implementation the zlig regenerates into the patients own tissue zlig is humanized through our patented process which produces human immune system compatible tissue  surgeons use zlig like any other graft zlig is ready to use and has been designed to require no changes in surgical technique  this is designed to create better results for patients

which potentially provides a readily available offtheshelf solution and is strong sterile and reproducible the zlig has been granted ce mark approval for revision and multiligament acl reconstruction procedures it is the first and only solution of it’s kind with  patents worldwide aperion biologics inc developed and patented a technique to make animaltissues usable for human applications without causing rejection the core platform technology is an enzymatic stripping of the key carbohydrate antigens followed by a unique conversion process that both “humanizes” and sterilizes the tissues without affecting their biomechanical or biological properties this tissue scaffold provides mechanical stability and function while being biologically integrated and remodeled rejection is the major obstacle preventing the use of animal derived tissue in human transplantation historically tissue rejection was addressed by complete tissue crosslinking incorporating associated antigens into a nonremodelable prosthesis much like leather the complete crosslinking process renders a “permanent” tissue implant that inhibits human host cells of being incorporated and remodeled into natural biological tissue previous attempts at developing an animal derived tissue device have failed due to inflammation or adverse biological reactions to solve the xenotransplant rejection problems mentioned above aperion developed the zprocess™ the zprocess™ is a proprietary process that immunochemically modifies animal tissue to be compatible with the human immune system aperion uses αgalactosidase enzyme to cleave the terminal αgal antigen so that the carbohydrate chain remaining on the animal tissue is the same in its structure as the carbohydrate chains present in humans the zprocess™ deactivates both αalphagal and nongal antigens on the xenograft tissue to prevent rejection aperion’s proprietary method addresses both the xenograft rejection as well as the ability to encourage a biological response to an implant the zlig device as an immunocompatible porcinederived acl reconstruction alternative which provides a readily available offtheshelf solution and is strong sterile and reproducible the manufacturing process and subsequent product are protected by over  issued patents aperion’s zprocess™ of humanizing and sterilizing tissue can be applicable to a variety of tissues from orthopedic ligaments bone and meniscus to valves and vessels to soft tissue grafts for augmentation and repair   read about the zlig clinical trial patents  intellectual property an extensive intellectual property portfolio protects aperion product candidates and zprocess™ technology currently  us and international patents have been issued and a number are pending aperion’s patent portfolio includes claims relating to treatment and application of specific tissues for a variety of medical and surgical uses the intellectual property portfolio includes combined patents of process and material composition that support deantigenation sterilization and viral inactivation of a wide range of biological tissues aperion has exclusive rights to the only known method for humanizing nonprimate animal grafts for replacement of ligaments bone etc in humans without making the graft inert patents regarding zprocess™ include coverage of key immunochemical modification and
