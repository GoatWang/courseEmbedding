your yield with better interfaces  and a better interface company intest interfaces are designed to deliver higher yield than competitive interfaces and this is why engineering excellence intest interfaces avoid lossy plastics and other components that compromise performance our special materials and stateoftheart design give you wider bandwidths lower crosstalk and tightly controlled impedance the result fastrisetime pulses with significantly better signal integrity deep customizing intest interfaces combine the reliability of selected standardized design elements with an extensive program of deep customization precisely matching interface performance not only to the requirements of your test but also to the environment in which your test will be conducted rugged dependability our interfaces are designed and manufactured to be more durable than competitors units they last longer so your test floor stays up and running       an interface you can trust we design and manufacture all our test interfaces at the fremont ca facility weve installed a class  clean room environment that is cleaner than those of our competitors  in fact it is comparable to that of most semiconductor test floors but we do more than that to earn your trust unlike other manufacturers we characterize the interfaces signal path using vna vector network analysis for crosstalk and bandwidth and tdr time domain reflectometry for impedance so were sure weve met the parameters of your design requirement in fact we guarantee it if an intest interface does not meet the specified project parameters for bandwidth and impedance we will redesign it for you free a company you want to work with when you get an intest interface youre getting industryleading electrical and mechanical performance to meet your most demanding yield targets but even worldclass interface design and superb engineering arent enough you need an expertly designed company too a company that delivers the interface fast a company that has it working for you right out of the box a company that delivers another one as soon as you need it exactly like the first a company that designs new interfaces for your new products faster  and more efficiently  than anyone else in the business that company is intest industry relationships   to top   intest corporation all rights reserved
