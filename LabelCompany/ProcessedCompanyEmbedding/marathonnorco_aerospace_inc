improved lowmaintenance nickelcadmium batteries that supply reliable power for large commercial aircraft regional aircraft military aircraft corporate aircraft and helicopters batteries are faapma approved for many aircraft models offered in sizes from  to  amperehours are interchangeable with existing batteries therefore you can easily make the change to a lowmaintenance battery without aircraft modifications and can service the product with your existing battery shop equipment superpower batteries the rechargeable vented nickelcadmium batteries are widely used for engine starting and emergency power in commercial corporate and military aircraft  fixed wing and rotary they also supply power for military weapons ground vehicles medical and telecommunications equipment the

history marathonnorco aerospace traces its origin to marathon battery company marathon which was incorporated in 9 marathon began producing carbonzinc dry batteries and cells during world war ii and the korean war the company was an important supplier of military batteries and won the coveted army and navy “e” award for its excellence marathon was given the “e” award for its continued effort in the development of new or improved battery products in  the company initiated development of a rechargeable sintered plate nickelcadmium battery in  marathon became the first company in the united states to manufacture sealed nickelcadmium batteries in  marathon began to produce nickelcadmium batteries for the atomic energy commission and for the united states army nike missile program after producing millions of amperehours of batteries for missiles the company began to design batteries to meet stringent aircraft applications after testing and acceptance by the united states air force strategic air command nickelcadmium batteries were adopted for the b bomber fleet the introduction of other models for military commercial and corporate aircraft rapidly made marathons batteries the industry leader marathon lead the way with sealed batteries that became the first to power satellites and were used on such projects as explorer pioneer midas tiros transit courier greb oso relay syncom nimbus alouette and isis marathon powered spacecraft have set longevity records for continuous successful operation during the mid’s a great deal of research and development work was done to develop batteries with greater capacity per unit of volume and weight than the traditional carbonzinc battery after testing the united states army signal corps had indicated that the magnesiummanganese dioxide dry battery had excellent shelf life characteristics at an elevatedtemperature a contract was negotiated with the government to produce ba batteries in  marathon began the production of the ba for use as the power source in the prc and prc transceiver sets marathon battery continued to manufacture carbonzinc batteries at wausau wisconsin magnesium batteries in st paul minnesota vented and sealed nickelcadmium batteries at cold spring and roe park new york but marathon was rapidly outgrowing its production facilities as new markets developed in  the company had
