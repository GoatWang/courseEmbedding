gatx derives its name from its primary reporting mark for its north american railcars gatx the mark itself was derived from gatxs prior corporate name general american transportation since all nonrailroad owners of railcars must append an x to the end of their mark gat became gatx gatx mainly applies the gatx mark to tank cars although the mark has been used in other examples such as with hoppers gatxs primary freightcar marks are gacx for generalservice freight cars ggpx for coal cars gimx for intermodal cars gplx for plastic pellet cars gmtx and llpx for locomotives and gpfx for pressuredifferential cars gatx also owns a number of other marks including gabx gaex gfsx gohx gscx ipsx and trix many gatx cars carry a large gatx logo in the upper righthand corner of the car

the railcar and pays for any required property insurance and property taxes in a net lease the lessee applies its mark to the car and the lessee pays for any required property insurance and property taxes often on a netleased car there is no evidence of gatx ownership although some net lease cars carry a gatx logo the most common type of car in the gatx north american fleet is the tank car other major car types include covered hoppers opentop hoppers and gondolas gatx invests in nearly every type of railcar operated in north america in europe tank cars also make up gatxs largest fleet but unlike in north america gatxs european fleet includes substantial quantities of intermodal cars which are owned in a gatx joint venture called aae cargo in contrast gatxs north american intermodal car
