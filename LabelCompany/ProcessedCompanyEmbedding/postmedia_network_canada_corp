sun  justin tang  the canadian press  by david olivebusinessbusiness columnistsat jan  there is a cancer on canadian journalismthe malignancy is postmedia network canada corp a foreigncontrolled debtburdened contrivance flirting with insolvency that nonetheless is relied upon by about  million canadian readers postmedia’s plus media outlets mostly newspapers including some of the biggest dailies in the country represent a far greater concentration of news media ownership than exists in any other major economy and a degree of foreign ownership of the free press that would not be tolerated in the us france japan or germanythe good news is that the postmedia abomination which has never turned a profit is in such wretched condition that it’s not long for this world the bad news is that as long as the biggest newspaper publisher in the country clings to life it is a blight on all the communities it underservespostmedia is controlled by quickbuck hedge funds in the us leading this group is new yorkbased goldentree asset management which alone controls  per cent of postmedia indeed it was goldentree that created postmedia just five years ago by salvaging proud venerable newspapers like the vancouver sun the calgary herald the ottawa citizen and the montreal gazette from the ruins of the asper family’s bankrupt canwest empirefor generations canadian law has forbidden foreign ownership or control of canadian cultural assets but after permitting the sale to noncanadians of practically the entire canadianowned steel and mining industries then pm stephen harper’s government signed off on postmedia’s creation as well the americans put a canadian face on the deal by selecting paul godfrey  as postmedia’s ceo not by coincidence harper and godfrey a diehard tory are kindred spiritsarticle continued belowthough it was a thinly disguised foreign takeover ottawa didn’t object that postmedia’s advent showed no sign of complying with investment canada’s one basic demand of foreign takeovers — that they be of “net benefit” to canadafive years later no one can credibly argue that postmedia has been of net benefit to canada the most godfrey can do as he did recently is insist that canada is lucky that someone plucked the national post the edmonton journal and the regina leaderpost from the canwest ruins since no canadian bidders stepped forward to do sothat is a lie there were at least two credible bids by canadian interests as godfrey well knows and the canwest papers would not have perished in any case they would have been auctioned individually and as regional groups that would have served readers better than the monstrosity of postmedia it’s postmedia that is in financial extremis not postmedia’s paperspostmedia has laid off more than half of its employees and the staff reduction continues as recently as another round of layoffs this month which means that countless news stories are no longer reported and costly investigative and “enterprise” journalism is now an unaffordable luxuryrather than invest to improve this country’s journalism godfrey has been channelling william randolph hearst ordering all postmedia publications to endorse the harper government’s bid for reelection in october so much for the local editorial autonomy long enjoyed by certain of the larger postmedia papers when they were owned by the southam family which prided itself on their papers’ independence then again when you’re publishing local papers it’s only common and commercial sense that your papers reflect the views of the community and not toronto head officein the same election godfrey also sold the front pages of some major postmedia papers to the tories for fullpage ads which rendered the paper’s entire contents suspectthis month godfrey announced that newsrooms will be merged in cities where postmedia publishes a broadsheet paper and a tabloid in doing so godfrey is crossing a bright red line since editorial is what gives a media operation the unique voice with which it attracts readers and thus advertisersthe savage nonstop costcutting at postmedia has turned out to be a fool’s errand postmedia’s circulation and print and online ad revenues continue to fall — as confirmed in the company’s latest quarterly results released jan  — in part because the cutbacks have so degraded the product despite the costcutting postmedia has managed to lose more than half a billion dollars since  just over  million to be preciseunable to arrest the decline in its revenues postmedia took the drastic step last year of buying someone else’s revenues with its debtfinanced acquisition of the sun media tabloid chain with that  deal postmedia doubled down on the dubious bet it made with its similarly highrisk purchase of the canwest paperswith these rollallthedice gambits postmedia has installed a time bomb on its balance sheet of  million in debt owed to the us hedge funds which financed postmedia’s creation and its illconsidered sun media expansion all that debt must be paid or refinanced by july  roughly half of it comes due in august  just  months from nowit’s very difficult to see where postmedia will get the money to do this postmedia is worth more dead than alive with its current negative net equity of  millionmoody’s investor services this month warned it is poised to further downgrade the rating on postmedia’s debt if “it is highly likely the company will default on its debt obligations” and rbc dominion securities took the unusual step of cutting its price target on postmedia’s stock to zero for which the rare precedents include the now defunct radioshackcom llc and general motors corp just before its  bankruptcy filingthat postmedia debt by the way carries a lofty  per cent interest rate which means the us hedge funds are doing just fine as long as godfrey can make those payments from an eroding revenue base the interest payments have become downright asphyxiating — “a noose around your neck” godfrey said this month — with the collapse of the loonie given that every dime of the debt is usdominatedbottom line postmedia has erased about  million dollars in shareholder value a record in the year history of canadian newspapers the company’s shares have lost more than  per cent of their value from their  peak and currently trade at  centsgodfrey’s stated business plan included an ambitious sale of assets but godfrey has sold just one significant asset the victoria times colonist net proceeds from postmedia asset sales over the past four years amount to a piddling  million of the firm’s stated assets of  million that last figure is mostly matched by debt the rest is largely “goodwill” an ephemeral accounting termgodfrey said recently that most of postmedia’s papers are making money that’s almost certainly true it’s north america’s largest metropolitan dailies that are taking the biggest hit from the transformation to the information age postmedia’s many small midsize and community papers continue to profit from their monopoly statusthe paucity of postmedia asset sales combined with the continued profitability of most of postmedia’s papers lends credibility to the current rumours that postmedia is on a deliberate path to selfdestructionthat way the us hedge funds that have already reaped tens of millions of dollars from postmedia in interest payments can get their hands on a bankrupt postmedia’s real estate and other assets at firesale prices as debtholders the hedgies will be at or near the front of the line of creditors in a bankruptcy proceedingto assist the assetflipping yanks postmedia is said to be lobbying ottawa for a relaxation of canadian ownership rules on cultural assets since some of the deepestpocketed bidders on a bankrupt postmedia’s assets are likely to be foreignersthere are alternatives more honourable than that outcome by which genuine canadian ownership is restored to newspapers that no longer have money sucked out of them but are reinvesting for a promising digital futurecharitable or nonprofit trust two of the world’s mostrespected newspapers the londonbased sister national papers the guardian and
