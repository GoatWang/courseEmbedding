protestants have mutilated the book of god are yet aiding and abetting the protestant crime by forcing their native converts to purchase the authorised version av of the bible which is the only bible available in some  languages of the lesser developed nations of the world the roman catholics milk their cows but the feeding is left to the protestants the overwhelming majority of christians ‚Äî both catholics and protestant ‚Äî use the authorised av or the king james version kjv as it is alternatively called glowing tributes glowing tributes glowing tributes glowing tributesglowing first published as sir winston says in  and then revised in  rv and now rerevised and brought up to date as the revised standard version rsv  and now again rererevised in  still rsv for short let us see what opinion christendom has of this most revised bible the rsv  the finest version which has been produced in the present century ‚Äî church of england newspaper  a completely fresh translation by scholars of the highest eminence ‚Äî times literary supplement  the wellloved characteristics of the authorised version combined with a new accuracy of translation ‚Äî life and work  the most accurate

bible av the worlds best seller these revisers all good salesmen have some very pretty things to say about it however their page iii paragraph six of the preface of the rsv reads the king james version alternative description of av has with good reason been termed the noblest monument of english prose‚Äô its revisers in  expressed admiration for its simplicity its dignity its power its happy turns of expression  the music of its cadences and the felicities of its rhythm‚Äô it entered as no other book has into the making of the personal character and the public institutions of the englishspeaking peoples we owe to it an incalculable debt can you dear reader imagine a more magnificent tribute being paid to the book of books than the above i for one cannot let the believing christian now steel himself for the unkindest blow of all from his own beloved lawyers of religion for in the very same breath they say yet the king james version has grave defects and that these defects are so many and so serious as to call for revision    this is straight from the horses mouth ie the orthodox christian scholars of the highest eminence another galaxy of doctors of divinity

the bible as a catholic christian i agree that the kjv has many ideological and theological defects reflected in the lovely translation which was made by learned anglicans of the early th century ad working with the tools of that time and place there are no problems with holy writ rightly interpreted i have far more problems with the quran and haddith and the claim of the quran to inspiration and

educational corporation   ed pp   rev holt h graham rev joseph m petulla mr cecil roth charlton heston the king james translation has been described as the monument of english prose as well as the only great work of art ever created by a committee both statements are true fifty four scholars worked seven years to produce the work from its extant texts in aramaic hebrew greek latin and english such an undertaking can be expected to produce great scholarship but hardly writing as spare and sublime as the king james the authors of several boring translations that have followed over the last fifty years mumble that the kjv is difficult filled with long words have a look at the difficult long words that begin the old testament and end the gospels in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void darkness was upon the face of the deep and now of the other things which jesus did if they should be written every one i suppose the world itself could not contain the books that would be written shakespeare aside theres no comparable writing in the language as has been observed by wiser men than i over the past several centuries its been the

the lingua franca of the world in the next century exploring it during this shoot ten commandments was one of the most rewarding creative experiences of my life in the arena an autobiography pp  george bernard shaw the translation was extraordinarily well done because to the translators what they were translating was not merely a curious collection of ancient books written by different authors in different stages of culture but the word of god divinely revealed through his chosen and expressly inspired scribes in this conviction they carried out their work with boundless reverence and care and achieved a beautifully artistic resultthey made a translation so magnificent that to this day the common human britisher or citizen of the united states of north america accepts and worships it as a single book by a single author the book being the book of books and the author being god the men behind the king james version by g s paine baker book house grand rapids mich  ed pp

phone include area code email thank you for your order we look forward to our conversation have questions chat with representatives name what happens when we die at death our spirit and physical body are separated at the resurrection our spirit and body reunite in a perfected state never to be separated again our spirits are divine and they are eternal they existed long before we were born and they will continue on forever after we die in many ways we can compare our existence to a threeact play with a premortal existence an earthly existence and a postmortal existence while most of us focus only on the act we‚Äôre currently taking part in‚Äîour life here on earth‚Äîgod‚Äôs plan for us includes our entire existence we have to exercise faith when trying to understand his vantage point because our concepts of time and purpose are limited by the mortal lens through which we view them accordingly we have difficulty envisioning the limitlessness of eternity and eternal progressiongod‚Äôs plan of salvation for us included leaving his presence in the premortal world to achieve the kind of progression unique to an earthly existence the earth was a place where we could gain physical bodies exercise agency grow in wisdom faith and compassion build relationships with others and perform holy ordinances necessary for our salvation expand text during our mortal life we must put forth great effort to perfect ourselves unlike our savior jesus christ we sin and fall short as we strive for this perfection to balance the scales of justice the savior atoned for our sins ensuring that our physical death would not be the end of our progression this gift of resurrection is available to all of us but whether or not we attain a fulness of joy after this life is determined by how we spend our time here on earth after death we enter the spirit world where we no longer have physical distractions and where our actions on earth determine the amount of peace and happiness we experience in this new realm in many ways we judge ourselves while we await our resurrection and the final judgment of jesus christthat is why this life is a time of testing‚Äîbecause our actions in this life determine our eternal destiny those who repent and live valiant lives will feel peace and happiness in the spirit world which will be for them a state of paradise and rest those who live otherwise will become acutely aware of their sins and will be in a spirit prison of their own making but god is compassionate and even here he allows us to progress and to be taught things we still need to learn we can continue to learn about and benefit from the atonement faith in god and jesus christ repentance and the fulness of the gospel saving ordinances can be performed on earth by proxy for those who were not baptized or sealed to their families during their earthly lives and if these works are accepted by those who have passed on then these individuals can progress to paradise while awaiting the resurrectionhumans have lived on the earth in periods of time known as dispensations and the last dispensation is a period marked by events prophesied by god‚Äôs prophets from ancient times paul spoke of a future time when all things that are in heaven and on earth would at last be gathered together and he called it the ‚Äúdispensation of the fulness of times‚Äù ephesians  the prophet isaiah also wrote of humanity during this time saying ‚Äúthey shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more‚Äù isaiah  before jesus ascended to heaven following his death and resurrection he said that he would return to earth in glory at that time he will serve as our king in isaiah daniel and john we read about christ dwelling among the inhabitants of earth and ruling over the kingdoms of both earth and heaven in the book of revelation we learn that the world will enjoy a thousand years of peace and that for the duration of the millennium satan will be bound when we talk about the ‚Äúend of the world‚Äù it does not mean the end of the earth or humankind but the end of evil as we read in genesis and exodus the millennium symbolizes a sabbatical in human history much like the role of the weekly sabbath day it is patterned after the lord‚Äôs period of rest following the six periods of the creation during the millennium the earth will be renewed to its former paradisiacal glory there will be a refreshment not a replacement of the world we know now the earth will not be destroyed but transformed‚Äîglorified‚Äîas the disparity between heaven and earth is overcome while jesus reignsjust as the world will be renewed and improved so too will the spirits of the dead be reunited with a perfected body in the resurrection as god‚Äôs children are resurrected we will be brought to stand before the lord who will ultimately judge us assigning us to the degree of glory we have earned while living in ¬†corinthians  paul discusses the three glories of resurrected bodies one like the sun celestial another like the moon terrestrial and the third like the stars telestial see verses ‚Äì ‚Äúso also is the resurrection of the dead‚Äù ¬†corinthians  in john  we read ‚Äúin my father‚Äôs house are many mansions ¬†¬† i go to prepare a place for you‚Äù of the three degrees of eternal glory celestial terrestrial and telestial even the lowest kingdom surpasses the glory of the earth but god dwells in the celestial kingdom and only those whose lives prepared them to live in his presence can also dwell there while it might seem harsh to deny some of god‚Äôs children access to him in the eternities we each have agency and are allowed the desires of our hearts through our choices on earth we choose our eternal destiny those of us who want to claim the highest degree of exaltation and dwell with our father are actively earning our place there now while we have earthly bodies and the agency to do so we do this because we love him and want to be with him collapse text what happens after we die take the quiz why does life continue after death as humans we tend to define life in terms of our mortal physical bodies however life should really be seen in a much bigger context our spirits‚Äîour individual characters‚Äîexisted before we had bodies and they will continue to exist after we die we all lived before this life as spirits with our heavenly parents we each accepted the challenge of receiving a physical body so that we might experience the good and the bad in a way we could not experience them before during our time on earth we choose how to act and in so doing we show whether we are willing to become better individuals more like our father in heaven but mortal life is just one necessary segment of our eternal journeywhen our physical body dies our spirit continues to live we continue to exist as the same individuals we were before‚Äîbut we‚Äôve had the opportunity to grow and progress because of our mortal experiences our ability to learn doesn‚Äôt end with death either as spirits we continue to be taught eternal truths and we choose to accept or reject teachings and ordinances that will prepare us to live again with our heavenly father in happiness play life is a journey when audrey curtis delivers a new baby she sees hope‚Äîfor that child‚Äôs happiness and for its future beyond this life play ‚Äúi‚Äôve been blessed to have peace in my life after the tragic death of my little brother because i believe we will be together again someday‚Äù how will eternal life look we can live again with family and friends who have died we hope that we‚Äîand they‚Äîhave made choices that will ultimately allow us to be with each other forever in the presence of god mortal birth and death are steps along the eternal path so is the resurrection this reunion of spirit and body was made possible by our savior jesus christ because of his resurrection all who have lived on this earth can reclaim their physical bodies in perfected immortal form never again will we experience pain sickness or deathall people will be resurrected and all people will be judged ‚Äúaccording to their works‚Äù revelation  during this life those who have shown obedience to god‚Äôs commandments followed jesus christ and accepted his atonement will be rewarded as ‚Äúheirs of god and jointheirs with christ‚Äù romans those who do not choose to follow heavenly father and jesus christ will be judged according to what they have done in this life but they will not enjoy the full glory of living in the presence of god and yet as a loving parent our heavenly father wants his children to return to him to experience his glory and to live eternally being sealed to spouses and children in ‚Äúfulness of joy‚Äù psalm  play my chance will come his dad didn‚Äôt live to see him graduate two of his children died before he could raise them but clark

name what is the book of mormon the book of mormon is another witness of jesus christ does it seem possible that god stopped talking to man after the last page of the new testament or the last page of the old testament for that matter our ancestors were taught by living prophets and those prophets recorded holy scripture‚Äîprofound spiritual lessons embedded in the history of their people while many of our questions and struggles are similar to those of biblical times it only makes sense that a loving god would continue guiding his children with additional messages of hope and wisdom applicable to their lives the book of mormon is exactly that continued revelation from god that serves as a witness to the truths in the bible and to the divinity and teachings of jesus christthe book of mormon answers essential questions that we all have at some point is there life after death and what‚Äôs waiting for us on the other side what is the purpose of life and how can i find happiness

recognize ourselves in their stories‚Äîinspired and inspiring spiritual records that are similar in form and content to those in the biblefaithful christian prophets wrote and safeguarded the records now contained in the book of mormon for centuries before they were compiled by the ancient prophet mormon people often refer to us as ‚Äúmormons‚Äù because his name is in the book‚Äôs title but we are followers of jesus christ‚Äîand the official name of the church bears his name the church of jesus christ of latterday saints we believe that jesus christ‚Äôs gospel was restored on earth by the prophet joseph smith who in  translated the ancient scriptural texts by the gift of revelation from god like the ancient prophets who came before him joseph smith served as god‚Äôs messenger and testified of jesus christ‚Äôs atonement and of the savior‚Äôs ability to change our lives for good the book of mormon is a fundamental part of jesus christ‚Äôs restored church on the earth today god promises us that if we read the book of mormon with an open heart and mind he will reveal to each of us its divinity and its truth through inspiration from the holy spirit some  mormon missionaries are teaching people about this book on six continents in  languages‚Äîand these people are currently putting that promise to the test missionaries give out copies of the book of mormon for free yet
