longlasting protection from corrosion ceramic heater vs wire wound heater most soldering irons are produced using a wire wound heating element similar to the heating element of toasters it causes resistance along the wire and with resistance heat but recently manufacturers have developed a new ceramic heating element designed to use much less energy and wattage this ceramic element passes the electricity right to the tip of the element providing heat right onto the tip considering that the ceramic heaters are considerably smaller manufacturers have redesigned the iron so the heating element fits inside the tip while the wire wound models have the element on the outside of the tip the ceramic element heats up five times faster than the wire wound option learn more in this video

soldering is the process of bonding two or more metal items by filling the joint with a material called solder it differs from welding because the pieces being joined are not melted instead the filler metal is melted and flowed into the joint   the basic solder equipment needed is a solder iron and a soldering station however there are many options and accessories available to meet a variety of soldering needs when purchasing soldering equipment it is important to remember two things temperature and variable control are key these features will help improve soldering so be sure to consider the temperature ranges and variable control when choosing a soldering station keep extra nozzles and tips on hand these are inexpensive and consumable it is easier and more cost effective to purchase extras in advance rather than place another order and pay for shipping in the future soldering equipment is used by professionals as well as hobbyists one of the benefits of soldering is that the process is reasonably permanent but reversible desoldering tools are available to remove unwanted solder   soldering equipment applications plumbing electronics metalwork food and beverage roof
