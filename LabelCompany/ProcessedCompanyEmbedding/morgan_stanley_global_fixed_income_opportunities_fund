morningstar ratings the morningstar rating™ for funds or star rating is calculated for managed products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating

calculation utilizes the interestrate reset date rather than a securitys stated final maturity for variable and floating rate securities by looking to a portfolios interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates the wam measure effectively captures a funds exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements   wal is the weighted average life of the portfolio the wal calculation utilizes a securitys stated final maturity date or when relevant the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest such as a put feature accordingly wal reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit widening spreads or tightening liquidity conditions   select fund market disclaimer

distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most nextshares funds meet redemptions through authorized participants primarily in kind  meaning that the fund distributes current portfolio holdings of securities rather than cash by avoiding the sale of securities to meet redemptions nextshares can potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions and associated shareholder taxes the enhanced tax

purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads
