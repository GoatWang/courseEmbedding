entertainment group at the launch of streaming service directv now in november john stankey chief executive of att entertainment group at the launch of streaming service directv now in november dave kotinsky  getty images for directv meg jamescontact reporter telecommunications colossus att already is making plans for its management structure after it completes its proposed billion takeover of media giant time warner inc including expanding its operations in los angelesit is widely expected that att will turn to year phone company veteran john stankey to run the movie and television business once the time warner deal closes stankey  is a trusted lieutenant of att chief executive randall stephenson and he currently leads att’s entertainment group in el segundo which includes satellite television service directvdallasbased att has begun relocating  highlevel executives from its dallas headquarters and operations in atlanta to work at the el segundo campus where stankey is based the company wants los angeles where  att employees already work to become a more vibrant corporate centerthe gargantuan time warner merger was announced in october and the us department of justice antitrust division has been reviewing the combination to make sure that it won’t choke competition in the media and telecommunications industries if the deal is approved by justice department regulators and us atty gen jeff sessions the telecommunications giant would control such prized media assets as cnn hbo tbs tnt cartoon network and warner bros film and television studio observers expect the justice department to approve the deal this year perhaps as early as septemberatt sponsored a conference friday and saturday for software developers on the warner bros studio lot in burbank as the company takes strategic steps to raise its profile in the entertainment community“la is a real critical place for us” stankey who currently serves as chief executive of att entertainment said in an interview this week “i have bought in — hook line and sinker — to the silicon beach entertainment nexus — and this is why we want to be here it is a softwaredriven world”bloomberg news first reported that att plans to break itself into two independent companies once the merger is finalized — phone operations in one group and media and entertainment in the other stankey would reportedly run the entertainment operations including the time warner properties while john donovan another att veteran would run the phone serviceatt on friday said “no decisions on organizational structure or leadership have been finalized”stankey also said those decisions were still pending in part because the justice department has rules that restrict cooperation and sharing of information between two companies before a merger is complete“making final decisions on organizational structure and what we are going to do is — believe it or not — something that is done very very late in the process” stankey said “we don’t have the access to all the information and insights that we need to be able to make those decisions until we are further along in the process”however time warner chairman and chief executive jeff bewkes is expected to step down from his leadership role as soon as att takes over the venerable media company bewkes has said he will stick around as long as att needs his help with the integration but executives within att and time warner believe that att quickly will begin calling the shotsfor example after att assumed control of directv in  stankey immediately replaced the former directv ceo mike white and there was an exodus of longtime directv executivesdividing the company into two distinct business units would follow a model used by philadelphia cable giant comcast corp when it acquired nbcuniversal in  comcast chief executive brian roberts turned to his trusted deputy steve burke to run nbcuniversal in new york and tapped another executive to oversee the cable television and broadband internet operationsit is unclear whether dividing the company would also satisfy concerns that are expected to be raised by regulators such as how att would safeguard personal information about phone customers as well as ensuring editorial independence at cnncnn has become a particular sore spot for president trump who frequently criticizes cnn’s coverage of him and before the election trump said his administration would block the proposed merger because it would consolidate too much power in a single company although people close to the companies believe that trump now is more comfortable with the dealanother area of concern is that att’s phone operations are highly regulated and frequently have issues pending before state and municipal governments including where the company can locate its cellphone towers separating the two spheres could help to insulate cnn one of the nation’s premier news organizations from meddling by politiciansstephenson will remain chairman and chief executive of att once the deal is finalized att said fridaythere is a wild card in the justice department review of the atttime warner deal the us senate has not confirmed trump’s pick to run the antitrust division makan delrahim who would become the assistant attorney general under sessions delrahim was nominated in march and a senate subcommittee approved his appointment by a  vote in june he is now awaiting the approval of the full senateuntil he is confirmed acting assistant atty gen andrew finch is overseeing the att merger review meanwhile opponents are mobilizing to try to persuade regulators to block the deal“theres a growing discomfort across the political spectrum of consumers that amassing more power in the hands of fewer media and cable giants will drive up prices and limit choices” said gene kimmelman chief executive of the consumer rights group public knowledge “its time for antitrust enforcers to do their job and stand up to monopolistic dangers like the atttime warner merger” caption justin chang reviews war for the planet of the apes directed by matt reeves and starring andy serkis woody harrelson

att entertainment  internet services where he will run both directv and atts home solutions operations stankey talked to usa today tech columnist edward c baig about what the deal means for att and for consumerscomments were edited for space and clarityusa today what is your vision for the new companystankey the simple vision is we want customers to take their premium entertainment experience and enjoy it anywhere our job as a company that provides connectivity whether its fixed or mobile is to make sure that they have that portabilitynobody else has the kind of toolset and breath that we now havescaled content world class mobile network broadband network the technical compatibilities to take all that out over an ip infrastructure thats the big strategic thrustand then theres the basic blocking and tackling thrust to take two big companies and get the benefits of being able to leverage product distribution remove redundancies between the two businesses and make it more cost efficient and more effective that ultimately generates more cash and when that cash is generated it will allow us to plow it back into building fiber and broadbandusa today will there be changes in brandingstankey youll see us of course start to move to make sure that people know that directv is part of the att family and youll see us evolving the branding over time our goal is to make sure that customers think about their entertainment with their connectivityusa today back when deal was announced att said it could take  to  months for new robust wireless offerings is that still the casestankey theres good news and bad news the bad news is that it took a long time to get this merger thing approved probably longer than it should the good news is that it gives you a little time to think about what you want to do and you should probably expect weeks from now youre going to start to see things in the market that will represent the integration and togetherness of those products im not going to tell you today what the price is and what those products are but they will be out there and i think youll be surprised by how fast we move out there weve had  months to think about it and  months within the bounds of the law to do some planningusa today will uverse and directv coexiststankey we sold to different customer bases theres some overlap in the markets but we played to the bundle game with uverse by consolidating product offerings directtv played to people who wanted to buy standalone video we now can start to cross market products and services over the long haul our goal is offer one video product in the market with one video channel lineup one set of programming relationships one video brandto do that we have to do integration work of the technical platforms i wouldnt think about it as one going away or the other one going away its about how the two of them arrive at a new place thats better building that new platform is going to take us  to  months our goal is if youre a consumer of ours today that this transition is done in way that is evolutionary and noninvasive this new platform is very software centric well be able to bring the customer new features and services incrementallyusa today does this deal change atts views on net neutrality or its open internet policystankey were still in favor of an open internet and still supportive of rules around nondiscrimination of traffic our issue is with title ii its not about whether we think the internet should be open and fair we think title ii is a regulatory overreach and it adds a degree of uncertainty into an investment marketplace when the fcc at any time can choose to reach in and reset the rules or regulate price or change performance metrics that create problems for consistency in business models this transaction doesnt change anything about our challenge around thatfcc approves atts acquisition of directvusa today what kind of clout does the directv deal give attstankey i think it s nice to be able to play in a league thats closer to what a vertically integrated comcast can play in we dont own content like they doour situation is we at least have volume scale it is important to generate returns to invest in fiber and bring more broadband to customers but we also want that ability so that we can go start working with the people who have the really attractive content to build these new distribution models if youre talking about  million homes that buy video — traditional linear video — and  million high quality handsets and customers that are out there many of whom have smartphones thats a whole other opportunity to distribute content that will allow us to do something with these guys that others who dont have this whole set of vertically integrated capabilities—home broadband mobile great tv product etc — can dousa today how does this benefit consumersstankey the fcc believed that another player in the market that had some scale would help to suppress the increase thats going on in rates so i think consumers are going to see an economic valueusa today big mergers often bring job loss to the new company what do you expectstankey obviously theres going to be some functions that are going to be redundant when you put two large businesses together like this theres two treasury organizations and two legal organizations but this is about us growing broadband and video share and making this business more competitive that growth is going to be really good for employees who are in operating roles when youre growing you need more technicians and more people to talk to customers on the phone and you do more investment with it so the vast majority of folks are going to have more than enough work to do over the next several months and years to get this business operating right aside from some of the corporate overheads that were going to have to manage throughemailebaigusatodaycom follow usa today tech columnist edbaig on
