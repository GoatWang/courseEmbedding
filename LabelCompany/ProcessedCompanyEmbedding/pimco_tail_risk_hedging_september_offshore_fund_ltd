class and targets net annualised returns of  to  per cent with equivalent volatility independent of broad measures of market return positions span interest rates equities commodities and currencies and reflect structural opportunistic and tailrisk hedging dimensions josh thimons josh davis and matt dorsten the fund’s portfolio management team are supported by pimco’s extensive firmwide resources across trade operations portfolio managementanalytics and product management pimco combines its deep understanding of volatility markets with a robust macroeconomic investment process the portfolio is designed so that no single theme dominates within structural strategies each asset class has a  to  per cent expected source of added value and risk contribution while for alpha strategies it is  to  per cent   product manager min xiao pictured says “structural positions exploit the tendency for levels of price volatility implied by options markets to exceed the values that are actually realised structural anomalies persist because endusers of the options markets are like insurance buyers who willingly pay a volatility premium each structural sleeve may have its own hedging requirements and together the structural strategies are sized with particular risk targets and diversification effects in mind   “discretionary positions express relative value views both within and across the asset classes in conditional form often influenced by macro considerations these conditional positions are designed to produce asymmetric payoffs with limited downside risk these positions two or three per asset class on average add an element of risk diversification and are rigorously governed with stoploss and targeted gain limits”   min also stresses the importance of tailrisk hedging in overall portfolio construction “the tailrisk strategy primarily consists of long volatility positions across multiple markets to hedge against extreme market crises” she says “returns in the active tail risk strategy are generally expected to be negative in benign markets but may produce strong positive returns when the volatility of certain asset classes spikes furthermore the fund is committed to spending at least  basis points per year on tailrisk hedging”   since the fund’s launch in july  equity and bond markets have risen and fallen producing periods of high and low volatility but the mav fund has generated positive returns every month albeit over a short time period says min “up to the end of december the fund returned  per cent net of fees with annualised volatility of  per cent structural positions contributed  per cent of the returns discretionary positions  per cent and tailrisk hedging strategies  per cent”   min believes the fund’s low correlation with traditional asset classes makes it a good diversifier for investor portfolios certainly its marketneutral structure and active tailrisk overlay equip it to add value across asset classes in a variety of market environments   “the competitive landscape is limited for relative value volatility strategies” says min “proprietary trading desks are closing and the hedge fund community too has a much smaller asset base than precrisis while dislocations in the markets have become more frequent and extreme the competition in chasing those dislocations has diminished materially”   she adds “we are delighted by the hedgeweek award and committed to focusing on volatility as an asset class – delivering high absolute returns with limited volatility from pimco’s best ideas across global asset classes”  please click

macroeconomic uncertainty and market turbulence investors are searching for ways to diversify portfolios with nontraditional asset classes volatility risk premium strategies aim to capture a return premium over time as compensation for the risk of losses during sudden increases in market volatility we believe investors seeking to diversify their equity risk exposures should consider adding volatility risk premium strategies to their portfolios albeit with appropriate diversification across major option markets active risk management and prudent scaling article main bodyelevated global macroeconomic uncertainty and bouts of extreme market turbulence have recently plagued financial markets this environment has prompted a search for diversifying investment opportunities that lie outside the space of traditional asset classes this article examines the performance of options strategies that aim to capture a return premium over time as compensation for the risk of losses during sudden increases in market volatility we show that these “volatility risk premium” strategies deliver attractive riskadjusted returns across  options markets from june  to june  performance furthermore improves significantly after the crisis in  see figure  we conclude that the riskreturn tradeoff for volatility strategies compares favorably to those of traditional investments such as equities and bonds and that the strategies exhibit relatively low correlations to equity risk investors who want to diversify their portfolio’s equity risk exposures should therefore consider making allocations to volatility risk premium strategies however successful implementation would require diversification across major options markets equities interest rates currencies and commodities active risk management and prudent scaling   perspective on the volatility risk premium the volatility risk premium can be seen as compensation to option sellers for the risk of losses during periods when realized volatility increases suddenly these periods tend to coincide with general market turmoil elevated uncertainty and investor stress the volatility risk premium causes optionimplied volatility to exceed realized volatility on average optionimplied volatility is consequently a biased estimate of future realized volatility and therefore the volatility risk premium is just another economic risk premium that investors may consider as part of their portfolios similar “biases” can be observed in all asset markets that expose investors to important systematic risk factors in interest rate markets the term premium which can be seen as compensation for uncertainty about future inflation and monetary policy typically causes forward rates to exceed realized interest rates in credit markets the creditrisk premium causes marketimplied default rates to exceed realized default rates on average and compensates investors for the risk of losses on defaults and downgrades finally the currencycarry risk premium typically causes forward exchange rates of lowyielding currencies to exceed realized exchange rates   in addition the observed magnitude of the volatility risk premium may be supported structurally by an imbalance in supply and demand buyers of options include hedgers or speculators seeking leverage with capped downside but there are few natural sellers of options imbalances between supply and demand for options may have been especially acute following the  financial crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crises while demand for options has increased fewer market participants are willing or able to supply options due to increased capital requirements higher costs and lower tolerance of leverage   strategies to capture the volatility premiumour analysis is based on data from  options markets grouped into four categories  equities equity index options sp  euro stoxx ftse  nikkei commodities commodity futures options oil gold natural gas currencies currency forward options eur gbp jpy – each vs usd interest rates year swaptions usd eur gbp jpy as a first indication of the magnitude of the volatility risk premium in these markets figure  compares average onemonth optionimplied volatilities to subsequent onemonth realized volatilities options are equally weighted within each broad market the difference is positive on average and significant – corresponding to roughly onetenth of the implied volatility     of course these results do not directly correspond to the returns of a tradable strategy the simplest way to capture the volatility risk premium is to sell onemonth atthemoney straddlesi straddles are comprised of a put and a call at the same strike and maturity the straddles need to be hedged each day against moves in the underlying instrument “deltahedging” so that they remain exposed primarily to changes in market volatility we calculate hypothetical monthly returns of this strategy in each of the  options markets from june  to june  the straddles are sold on the first business day of each month and held till expiry we include conservative trading costs on both the sale of the option and the rebalancing of the hedgeii   figure  shows average excess returns standard deviations of returns and the associated sharpe ratios for each optionmarket category the sharpe ratio measures the excess return per unit of standard deviation in an investment asset or trading strategy we find significant positive excess returns in each market with sharpe ratios of  for commodities and interest rates  for equities and  for fx     these sharpe ratios compare favorably with other asset classes however it is wellknown that standard deviation alone is insufficient as a measure of riskiness of a given investment strategy this is especially true for strategies with embedded tail risks and returns that may be skewed to the downside   tail risk analysis to analyze the left tail risk in the volatility strategies we calculate the worst returns over one three and month periods figure  and the number of standard deviationsiii  to which these returns correspond to summarize the right tail of the distributions we use the same statistics for the highest returns the last column notes the dates of the worst threemonth periods     over short horizons the strategies show significant negative skewed tail risk all experience at least three to foursigma losses over one month vs two to threesigma gains in the right tail however over a month period the pattern is reversed the strategies exhibit positive skew the right tail of the distribution is more pronounced than the left tail   these results highlight a consistent empirical characteristic of volatility strategies they are typically subject to relatively short sharp losses but tend to recover quickly this may be because implied volatility tends to overreact to shocks due to demand from riskaverse hedgers and remains elevated for some time since the strategies sell shortdated options they monetize this excess risk aversion to further illustrate this effect figure  shows the average length of drawdowns of the volatility strategies compared with investments in other classic risk premium strategiesiv drawdowns are measured by the average number of months taken for a strategy to recover a previous peak the volatility strategies exhibit relatively short drawdowns of about five months compared with an average of more than one year for the us large cap stocks for example   figure  highlights the quarterbyquarter performance during  compared with us large cap stocks and us investment grade credit as in figure  quarterly returns are expressed as the number of standard deviations the volatility strategies experience smaller negative shocks than investment grade credit and comparable or smaller negative shocks than stocks the third quarter of  which includes the sharp selloff in september is the only quarter when all four volatility strategies have negative returns by the fourth quarter the volatility strategies start to recover as they monetize the higher implied volatility     how much return is attributable to equity risk market volatility tends to rise rapidly at times of overall market stress as such shortvolatility strategies would be expected to lose money when equities sell off especially during equity tail events are returns of these strategies simply due compensation for exposure to equity risk and to equity tail risk in particular to answer this we decompose returns into a component attributable to broad equity beta and a component attributable to exposure to equity tail riskv   figure  shows the proportion of the return that cannot be attributed to either equity beta or to equity tail risk equity volatility strategies unsurprisingly contain a substantial component of equity risk nearly  of returns are attributable to broadequity and tailequity risk currency volatility strategies also have a significant equityrisk component contributing nearly  of returns commodities and interest rate volatility strategies do not have substantial exposure to equity risk   these results highlight that the majority of the strategy returns more than  on average across asset classes cannot be explained by their exposure to equity risk this supports the hypothesis of a distinct volatility risk premium andor the existence of persistent structural supplydemand imbalances in the options market     is there a role for these strategies in portfolios the performance of the volatility strategies suggests that they may be attractive on a standalone basis to evaluate their contribution potential in an asset allocation context we next compare their risk return and correlation with other risk premiums   figure  compares realized sharpe ratios of the volatility strategies with the classic risk premium strategies see appendix for details across four historical periods the four periods cover the precrisis era june  to june  the crisis july  to march  the sharp recovery april  to march  and the sovereigncrisis period april  to june  the volatility strategies perform relatively well across each of these four periods with notably strong performance during the two most recent periods    finally figure  shows a monthly correlation matrix of the four volatility strategies with each other and with the other risk premiums although the correlations between the volatility strategies in the full sample are positive they are generally fairly low around  with the exception of the equity volatility strategies which are as high as  correlations do however increase across the board during the financial crisis as shown in the lower part of figure  conclusionthis article examines the historical performance of simple tradable strategies that are designed to capture the volatility risk premium over time the empirical analysis shows that the strategies deliver significant positive riskadjusted returns across  options markets over a sample period from june  to june  the strategies experience drawdowns during spikes in market volatility and exhibit fatter left tails than normal distributions but rebound fairly rapidly following such episodes overall the riskreturn tradeoff for the volatility premium compares favorably to other sources of risk premiums such as equity and credit as always there is a limit to conclusions that can be drawn based solely on historicalreturn analysis some potential risks may not have been realized during the sample period however given the economic rationale for the existence of a volatility risk premium and the supportive supplydemand situation that emerged following the  financial crisis we believe an allocation to volatility strategies could enhance portfolio efficiency an allocation should not be sized solely on historicalreturn statistics however but on conservative estimates of potential future returns volatility strategies are complex to implement so both active portfolio and risk management are critical to their successful implementation in portfolios     endnotes istraddles are comprised of an atthemoney put and call with the same expiry date on the day the straddle is sold the value of the option has close to zero sensitivity “zero delta” to changes in the price of the underlying during the month the delta may become positive or negative as the underlying moves potentially leading to option gains and losses driven by market direction rather than the volatility premium to neutralize this we simulate daily deltahedging – taking an offsetting position in the underlying market – at the market close the payoff of a deltahedged straddle is closely related to the difference between initial implied volatility and subsequent realized volatilityiia bidoffer of between  and  of the implied volatility is assessed on the sale of the option each month and a bidoffer of between  bps and  bps is assessed daily on the notional required to rebalance the hedges these bidoffers are further scaled up in periods of increased volatility representing a reduction in liquidity in stressed periods see appendix for additional detailsiiito reflect the changing magnitudes of returns through time we measure standard deviations using a month lookback window ending in the same month as the returnobservation window and then scale to match the returnwindow length for example if the worst threemonth return is from september  to november  inclusive the standard deviation is measured by monthly returns from december  to november  inclusive and multiplied by the square root of three to scale to a threemonth standard deviationivclassic risk premium strategies are defined as follows us large cap stocks measured as the total return of the sp  minus the total return of the barclays capital us  month tbill index us treasuries measured as the total return of the barclays us treasury index minus the total return of the barclays  month tbill index us investment grade credit measured as the excess return of the barclays us corporate index over durationmatched treasuries us high

minus the total return of the barclays capital  month tbill index emerging market bonds measured as the excess return of the jp morgan embi global index over durationmatched treasuries commodities measured as the total return of the dow jones ubs commodity index minus the total return of the barclays  month tbill index currency carry measured as the return of investing in the three highestyielding currencies and going short the three lowestyielding currencies each month as per the bloomberg function fxfbvthe return attributable to equity beta is computed by regressing monthly returns of the volatility strategy on the monthly excess returns of the sp  index and multiplying the beta of this regression by the average annual excess return of the sp  index the return attributable to equity and equity tail risk is computed by regressing monthly returns of the volatility strategy jointly on the monthly excess returns of the sp  index and the monthly excess returns of a short  outofthemoney onemonth sp  index put the return is then computed by summing the betas from this regression multiplied by average annual excess returns of the sp  index and the short puts

not actually been executed simulated results cannot account for the impact of certain market risks such as lack of liquidity there are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or the
