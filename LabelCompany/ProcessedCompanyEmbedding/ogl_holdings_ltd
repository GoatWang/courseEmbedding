not receive any proceeds from the sale of the selling shareholder shares ogl’s main business is a combination of agriculture in vegetable production and theme park entertainment they grow their produce through a hydroponic system which gives them the edge in their market as growing organic and healthy vegetables currently the lands of china are dominated by traditional farmers and farming methods there are few hydroponic growers in china and only several near ogl’s farm though there are the few farms that can offer produce similar to that of ogl’s produce none are at the scale at which ogl operates ogl will be able to offer their produce at a cost lower than competitors because of lower overhead cost per output and be able to supply it to large retail chains consistently not to mention the growing demand of consumers who want organic produce even with competitors the market is too huge to be covered by the current suppliers within the theme park industry ogl’s closest competitor would be china wu culture expo park they are a theme park that is largely based on cultural experience for the tourist in terms of competition they are really only a competitor if the tourists don’t actually know which theme park to go to ogl’s theme park is based on the whole agriculture experience it tries to teach and incorporate tourist into the farm by providing them with educational activities doing the actual picking of the vegetables tour the wide scale area in which they will experience how the farms food is grown and how they taste in general ogl is both an agricultural farm and theme park there have been a few businesses similar to this type of setup but those were ultimately unsuccessful ogl will incorporate the newest technology and be able to provide an abundance of food for china’s population they are also located near a famous mausoleum not far away which will influence potential tourist to visit their theme park ogl believes that it will be able to dominate its own market as a farmtheme park hybrid with little to no competition company description ogl holdings ltd is an earlystage ecologically conscious company formed to design build and manage an ecological theme park showcasing agriculturally advanced technologies and to produce organic agricultural food utilizing such technology for efficient and nondestructive production rapid growth ecological ignorance and corporate indifference are things that the company believes have contributed to the major pollution situation facing china the company believes that china is just beginning to develop environmental and ecological programs and the company intends to help educate and advance these new programs the agricultural theme park will provide visitors fun attractions and

fruit seeing hightech greenhouse cultivation as well as theme park type amusements the park will provide visitors the opportunity to see the layout and operation of a hightech smart greenhouse for

audited statements and b the condensed unaudited financial statements as of and for the periods ended september   and  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related footnotes included in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   the “ annual report” filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” on march    it is management’s opinion however that all material adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation the financial statements include all material adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals necessary to make the financial statements not misleading as required by regulation sx rule  operating results for the nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations expected for the year ending december     going concern the company’s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company expects to generate revenues through its operation of its organic exhibition garden and an ecoagricultural tourism theme park in china revenue will consist of sales from entrance tickets to the tourist theme park and selling of produce grown in its agricultural gardens the company has sustained operating losses since inception to date and allow it to continue as a going concern the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders the ability of the company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations and the attainment of growth and profits from its operations the company has incurred a net loss of  for the nine months ended september   has a working capital deficit of  and has an accumulated deficit of  as of september   these factors among others raise a substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   the following summary of significant accounting policies of the company is presented to assist in the understanding of the company’s financial statements the financial statements and notes are the representation of the company’s management who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity the financial statements of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap                ogl holdings ltd notes to condensed financial statements september   and  unaudited   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by the company may differ materially and adversely from the company’s estimates of valuation of equity instruments to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results future results of operations will be affected   cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents the company did not have any cash or cash equivalents at september   and december   respectively   fair value of financial instruments and fair value measurements accounting standards codifications “asc” asc  “ fair value measurements and disclosures”  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value   level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data   level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities   the company’s financial instruments consist principally of accrued liabilities and loan payable to a related party pursuant to asc  and asc  “ financial instruments”  the fair value of our accrued liabilities and loan payable to a related party is determined based on “level ” inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets the company believes that the recorded values of all of the other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations   revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured the company closely follows the provisions of asc  “ revenue recognition ” which includes the guidelines of staff accounting bulletin no  as described above  the company has not recognized any revenue for the three months and nine months ended september   and  respectively     earnings loss per common share the company computes net earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  “ earnings per share”  asc  requires presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share “eps” on the face of the income statement basic eps is computed by dividing earnings loss available to common shareholders numerator by the weighted average number of shares outstanding denominator during the period diluted eps gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible note and preferred stock using the ifconverted method in computing diluted eps the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants diluted eps excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is antidilutive   licensing rights   licensing rights which are stated at cost relate to the cost of obtaining the license to build organic exhibition garden and an ecoagricultural tourism theme park in china cost is based on the third party expenditures incurred for obtaining licensing rights the company will begin amortizing licensing cost over their estimated remaining useful life when it begins revenueproducing activities we will determine the useful life of licensing rights after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each such asset factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset the historical performance of the asset our longterm strategy for using the asset any laws or other local regulations that could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors including competition and specific market conditions                  ogl holdings ltd notes to condensed financial statements september   and  unaudited   equity instruments issued to nonemployees for acquiring goods or services issuances of the company’s common stock or warrants for acquiring goods or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to consultants or vendors is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached a “performance commitment” which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance or ii the date at which performance is complete however situations may arise in which counter performance may be required over a period of time but the equity award granted to the party performing the service is fully vested and nonforfeitable on the date of the agreement as a result in this situation in which vesting periods do not exist as the instruments fully vested on the date of agreement the company determines such date to be the measurement date and will record the estimated fair market value of the instruments granted as a prepaid expense and amortize such amount to general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of operations over the contract period when it is appropriate for the company to recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting periods prior to the measurement date for purposes of recognition of costs during those periods the equity instrument is measured at the thencurrent fair values at each of those interim financial reporting dates   noncash equity transactions shares of equity instruments issued for noncash consideration are recorded at the estimated fair market value of the consideration granted based on the estimated fair market value of the equity instrument or at the estimated fair market value of the goods or services received whichever is more readily determinable   income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with asc  “ income taxes”  the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized   the company follows the provisions of asc  “ accounting for uncertain income tax positions ” when tax returns are filed it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained in accordance with the guidance of asc  the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination   recent accounting pronouncements we qualify as an “ emerging growth company ” under the  jobs act section  of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards as an emerging growth company we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period   debt issuance costs in april  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” asu   interest—imputation of interest subtopic  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  this standard update requires an entity to present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability as opposed to an asset amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense the update is effective for annual reporting periods including interim reporting periods within those periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued and the new guidance would be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented  the company has not adopted asu  as of september   and the adoption is not expected to have an impact on the

accruals necessary to make the financial statements not misleading as required by regulation sx rule  operating results for the nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations expected for the year ending december     going concern the company’s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company expects to generate revenues through its operation of its organic exhibition garden and an ecoagricultural tourism theme park in china revenue will consist of sales from entrance tickets to the tourist theme park and selling of produce grown in its agricultural gardens the company has sustained operating losses since inception to date and allow it to continue as a going concern the continuation of the company as a going concern is

should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   the following summary of significant accounting policies of the company is presented to assist in the understanding of the company’s financial statements the financial statements and notes are the representation of the company’s management who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity the financial statements of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap          ogl holdings ltd notes to condensed financial statements september   and  unaudited   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by the company may differ materially and adversely from the company’s estimates of valuation of equity instruments to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results future results of operations will be affected   cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents the company did not have any cash or cash equivalents at september   and december   respectively   fair value of financial instruments and fair value measurements accounting standards codifications “asc” asc  “ fair value measurements and disclosures”  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value   level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data   level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities   the company’s financial instruments consist principally of accrued liabilities and loan payable to a related party pursuant to asc  and asc  “ financial instruments”  the fair value of our accrued liabilities and loan payable to a related party is determined based on “level ” inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets the company believes that the recorded values of all of the other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations   revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured the company closely follows the provisions of asc  “ revenue recognition ” which includes the guidelines of staff accounting bulletin no  as described above  the company has not recognized any revenue for the three months and nine months ended september   and  respectively     earnings loss per common share the company computes net earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  “ earnings per share”  asc  requires presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share “eps” on the face of the income statement basic eps is computed by dividing earnings loss available to common shareholders numerator by the weighted average number of shares outstanding denominator during the period diluted eps gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible note and preferred stock using the ifconverted method in computing diluted eps the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants diluted eps excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is antidilutive   licensing rights   licensing rights which are stated at cost relate to the cost of obtaining the license to build organic exhibition garden and an ecoagricultural tourism theme park in china cost is based on the third party expenditures incurred for obtaining licensing rights the company will begin amortizing licensing cost over their estimated remaining useful life when it begins revenueproducing activities we will determine the useful life of licensing rights after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each such asset factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset the historical performance of the asset our longterm strategy for using the asset any laws or other local regulations that could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors including competition and specific market conditions          ogl holdings ltd notes to condensed financial statements september   and  unaudited   equity instruments issued to nonemployees for acquiring goods or services issuances of the company’s common stock or warrants for acquiring goods or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to consultants or vendors is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached a “performance commitment” which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance or ii the date at which performance is complete however situations may arise in which counter performance may be required over a period of time but the equity award granted to the party performing the service is fully vested and nonforfeitable on the date of the agreement as a result in this situation in which vesting periods do not exist as the instruments fully vested on the date of agreement the company determines such date to be the measurement date and will record the estimated fair market value of the instruments granted as a prepaid expense and amortize such amount to general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of operations over the contract period when it is appropriate for the company to recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting periods prior to the measurement date for purposes of recognition of costs during those periods the equity instrument is measured at the thencurrent fair values at each of those interim financial reporting dates   noncash equity transactions shares of equity instruments issued for noncash consideration are recorded at the estimated fair market value of the consideration granted based on the estimated fair market value of the equity instrument or at the estimated fair market value of the goods or services received whichever is more readily determinable   income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with asc  “ income taxes”  the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized   the company follows the provisions of asc  “ accounting for uncertain income tax positions ” when tax returns are filed it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained in accordance with the guidance of asc  the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination   recent accounting pronouncements we qualify as an “ emerging growth company ” under the  jobs act section  of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for

statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing in the  annual report filed with the securities and exchange commission on march   and elsewhere in this report the analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable securities and exchange commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events   ogl holding ltd is an earlystage development company as of the periods from inception through the date of this report we did not generate any revenue and incurred minimal expenses and operating losses as part of its development stage activities we were incorporated in the state of delaware on january   and we were formerly known as red grotto acquisition corporation in march  red grotto acquisition corporation filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on form  by which it became a public reporting company     the company is an earlystage ecologically conscious company formed

production the agricultural theme park will provide visitors fun attractions and exhibitions including hand picking fruit seeing hightech green house cultivation as well as theme park type amusements the park will provide visitors the opportunity to see the layout and operation of a hightech smart greenhouse for organic plant cultivation and then use these models for their farms and greenhouses   anticipated timeline cost and summary of business plan   on february   the company signed an agreement with jiangsu ogl ecological agriculture science and technology co ltd “jiangsu ogl” this agreement grants the company an exclusive right to use jiangsu ogl’s business license to operate develop agriculture and tourism business on  acres farmland in jiangsu china the company will also lease and operate the organic exhibition garden that is owned by jiangsu ogl   the organic exhibition garden is  square meters in size and is located on the  acres farmland in jiangsu china  wwwjsoglcom  it is now open to the public for an entrance fee rmb usd for the visitors the visitors can view and experience the greenhouses plants and purchase fresh produce the company will pay  leasing fee for the organic exhibition garden with the first leasing fee due on june   starting the beginning of  the company will start earning revenues from organic exhibition garden through the entrance ticket and the selling of the produce from the garden   the company will pay an aggregate value of  for the exclusive right to use jiangsu ogl’s business license and the right to lease the organic exhibition garden this aggregate value includes  shares equivalent to  calculated at  per share to  jiangsu ogl shareholders the balance of  will be paid in cash to jiangsu ogl’s major partner ogl group pte ltd  months after the company receives the operation permit of the organic exhibition center from the government the organic exhibition garden terms and conditions will be renegotiated every  years   jiangsu ogl is owned by ogl group pte ltd mr lim kun lim and ms tian chunzhi are the major shareholders of the company and the acquisition is not deemed as an arm’s length transaction   mr lim chairman and president of the ogl holdings ltd agreed to pay all operation expenses for the company as director’s loan with no interest calculated until the company can raise sufficient funds for its operation and project development   the company anticipates that it will need approximately  to execute the licensing agreement and the operations of the organic exhibition garden are expected to commence sometime at the beginning of    as of september   the company had no cash and has earned no revenues nor realized any profits the company intends to make an equity offering of its common stock for the acquisition and operation expenses if it cannot raise the required cash the company will issue additional shares of common stock in lieu of cash           in september  the company exercised a change of control by redeeming shares of its existing shareholders issuing shares to new shareholders electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors in connection with the change of control the shareholders of the company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the company’s name from red grotto acquisition corporation to ogl holdings ltd   the company’s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business we have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern we funded our operations primarily through the financial support from our officers and shareholders the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders the ability of the company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations and the attainment of growth and profitable operations we incurred a net loss of  for the nine months ended september   had a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  as of september   these factors among others raise a substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations   financial operations overview   revenue   we have not earned revenues from our operations since january   inception to september   respectively we expect to earn revenues from operations commencing sometime in the beginning of    operating expenses   operating expenses for the three months and nine months ended september   were  and  compared to  and  for the same comparable periods in  operating expenses increased by  and  for the three months and nine months ended september   as compared to the same comparable periods in  primarily due to the increase in legal professional edgar xbrl filing fees and accounting fees incurred for complying with the rules of the sec we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase materially as we operate as a public company these increases will likely to include salaries and benefits legal and consulting fees accounting and audit fees director fees directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums fees for investor relations services enhanced business and accounting systems and other costs associated with operations     liquidity and capital resources   since our inception our operations have been primarily financed through funding from the officers and shareholders   for the nine months ended september   we had no cash and cash equivalents we believe that our existing capital resources will not be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next  months and we will need to raise additional capital based on our operating plan we will need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for operating the organic exhibition garden and ecoagricultural tourism theme park we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital to fund future operations we will need to raise additional capital funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at any terms if we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed we may have to delay reduce the scope of or even suspend development of future park exhibits we may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings debt financings collaborations strategic alliances licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements to the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights associated with our license agreement future revenue streams and we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us if we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights if we raise additional capital through debt financing we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends   the accompanying financial statements for the nine months ended september   and  have been prepared on a basis that contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business we have continuing net losses and deficiencies in working capital as of most of the balance sheet dates these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern these circumstances caused our independent registered public accounting firm to include an explanatory paragraph in their report dated march   regarding their concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional financing as may be required to fund current operations management’s plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining debt or other financing to fund its capital requirement and ongoing operations however there can be no assurance the company will be successful in these efforts these factors create substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern             operating activities   net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended september   was  which resulted primarily due to the net loss of  depreciation of  and increase in accrued liabilities of    financing activities   net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended september   was  which resulted primarily due to net proceeds from loans from related party in the amount of    noncash investing and financing activities   the company acquired property and equipment of  and the company’s chief executive officer paid the acquisition cost on behalf of the company the company acquired the licensing rights to operate and develop the agriculture business and to build and develop a  acre ecoagricultural tourism theme park and agreed to pay  in exchange of the licensing rights of which  still remain payable as of september     alternative financial planning   the company has no alternative financial plans at the moment if the company is not able to successfully raise funds as needed through a private placement or other securities offering including but not limited to a primary public offering of securities the company will not be able to implement its business plan as a going concern   equipment financing   the company has no existing equipment financing arrangements   critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates   our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we have identified the following accounting policies that we believe require application of management’s most subjective judgments often requiring the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods our actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material   while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note  of our annual financial statements included in our annual report filed with the sec on march   we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements      jobs act accounting election   we are an “ emerging growth company ” as defined in the jobs act under the jobs act emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the jobs act until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies   fair value of financial instruments and fair value measurements   asc  “fair  value measurements and disclosures”  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement   development stage and capital resources   the company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning since its inception on january   accordingly the company is considered to be in the development stage the company has not generated revenues from its operations and it will not commence generating revenues until sometime during    offbalance sheet arrangements
