of alo and a hexagonal crystal structure the mineral is widely known for its extreme hardness and for the fact that it is sometimes found as beautiful transparent crystals in many different colors the extreme hardness makes corundum an excellent abrasive and when that hardness is found in beautiful crystals you have the perfect material for cutting gemstones natural and synthetic corundum are used in a wide variety of industrial applications because of their toughness hardness and chemical stability they are used to make industrial bearings scratchresistant windows for electronic instruments

these blue stones are untreated and measure about four to five millimeters across geologic occurrence of corundum corundum is found as a primary mineral in igneous rocks such as syenite nepheline syenite and pegmatite some of the worlds most important ruby and sapphire deposits are found where the gems have weathered from basalt flows and are now found in the downslope soils and sediments corundum is also found in metamorphic rocks in locations where aluminous shales or bauxites have been exposed to contact metamorphism schist gneiss and marble produced by regional metamorphism will sometimes contain corundum some of the sapphires and rubies of highest quality color and clarity are formed in marble along the edges of subsurface magma bodies corundums toughness high hardness and chemical resistance enable it to persist in sediments long after other minerals have been destroyed this is why it is often found concentrated in alluvial deposits these deposits are the most important source of rubies and sapphires in several parts of the world traditional sources of alluvial rubies and sapphires include burma cambodia sri lanka india afghanistan montana and other areas in the past few decades several parts of africa including madagascar kenya tanzania nigeria and malawi have become important producers of ruby and sapphire emery wheels an ad offering emery and

abrasive the extreme hardness of corundum makes it especially useful as an abrasive crushed corundum is processed to remove impurities and then screened to produce uniformly sized granules and powders these are used for grinding media polishing compounds sand papers grinding wheels and other cutting applications some problems with using natural corundum as an abrasive are that the deposits are usually small irregular in shape and the corundum is of variable quality they are not reliable sources of consistentquality material needed to run a manufacturing process synthetic corundum produced

many gem corundum discoveries were made in africa all of the stones in this photo were mined in africa nearly all gem corundums are treated by heating or another process to improve their color the

geologycom store use as a gemstone in the gemstone and jewelry market almost all of the attention goes to a small group of gems known as the big four diamond ruby sapphire and emerald two of these ruby and sapphire are gem corundums these most popular gems are highly sought after and have been mined in many parts of the world for thousands of years today millions of rubies and sapphires are required every year to meet the demands of the jewelry market  from inexpensive commercial stones sold in malls and department stores to spectacular specimens used in designer and custom jewelry the demand for attractive stones exceeds the abilities of mines to supply as a result the prices paid for attractive natural stones have risen to high levels when a consumer wants a ruby ring or a sapphire pendant they are generally not interested in substituting a red spinel blue iolite or other attractive gem of similar color they want ruby or they want sapphire retail jewelers especially those selling pieces and sets for under  have been increasingly presenting synthetic or labcreated gems alongside the natural stones in their display cases the synthetic materials are genuine corundums they have the same aluminum oxide composition and crystal structure as natural rubies and sapphires their color is also produced by the same trace elements chromium for ruby and iron with titanium for sapphire they have the same optical appeal and a better physical appearance than similarsize natural stones of the same price as a result many consumers now gladly purchase synthetic stones because they receive a more attractive product at a price that they can afford over the long term synthetic gems are likely to continue displacing natural stones from the market especially in the lower and middle price ranges where consumers are very conscious about price corundum watch bearings corundum ruby bearings in an antique pocket watch with a jewel movement in the early s synthetic corundum was being used as the jewel bearings in watches image âš istockphoto  robertkacpura corundum bearings a drawing of jewel bearings and a capstone red holding a pivot wheel in a mechanical watch lubricated by oil yellow public domain image by chris burks chetvorno corundum jewels in watches in the mids watch makers in switzerland needed tiny bearings that were highly resistant to abrasion they discovered that they could drill a hole into a tiny piece of corundum and use it for a smoothrunning longlife bearing the corundum was much harder than the metals used to make the moving parts of a watch and it was able to stand up to the continuous abrasion without failing this made swiss watches and their jewel movements famous throughout the world for their long life and reliability in the early s synthetic corundum bearings replaced natural corundum bearings in most swiss watches this use of jewel bearings created a positive reputation for swiss watches that continues to this day  even while mechanical watches are being replaced by digital watches synthetic corundum a boule of synthetic corundum because of its red color it could be called synthetic ruby

public domain image by lawrence livermore national laboratory ruby lasers synthetic corundum is an essential part of many lasers in fact the first working laser was a ruby laser made by theodore maiman at hughes research labs in  it employed a synthetic ruby crystal as the gain medium the gain medium is a material in the laser that is the target of an intense burst of light that light causes electrons in the gain medium to jump up to a higher energy level causing the emission of photons which strike other atoms in the gain medium causing them to be excited and emit more photons this brief chain reaction produces the very intense light of a laser beam lasers are named after the material used as a gain medium such as ruby laser or titanium sapphire laser or yag laser yttrium aluminum garnet in just a few decades lasers have become common items of our society tiny lasers are used in cd and dvd players lasers are used to cut metal stone and other tough materials lasers are used to
