fallsbased retailer gunway has issued the following press release gunway liquidates springfield and rock river inventory donates proceeds to nraila sioux falls sd may st  – in response to springfield armory and rock river armory’s selling out our second amendment rights in exchange for illinois state antigun regulatory exemptions and for their support of antigun legislators gunway inc will immediate liquidate their inventory at cost of the aforementioned brands across their locations and donate all proceeds to the nraila to fight for our second amendment rights “we sell thousands of firearms per year between our two gun shops and ranges and the number of firearms we sell will increase dramatically with our planned growth this year” states dan hall ceo of gunway “we categorically denounce springfield and rock river’s actions we will no longer stock their products in our stores” gunway encourages other gun shops to follow suit about gunway gunway is a veteranowned and operated

smart prehearing protection act fact vs narrative in the trayvon martin case 8 responses to retailer gunway to liquidate springfield rock river inventory donate proceeds to nraila yeah been reading about quite a few gun stores having ‘sellout sales’ on sa and rra stock…i think this is going to leave a mark reply was i the only one who felt violated by the saint marketing campaign i felt the sellout at shot looks like my spidy instincts were right the kneedeep bs covering floor of the springfield booth area at the shot show was staggering and only outdone by the full color display of cooperate arrogance reply i wonder if this flap has anything to do with the promo sa is running ———————– purchase any new springfield armory® mm sw or acp pistol february  – june   and receive –  extra magazines – double mag pouch – right hand holster ——————— “defend your legacy” bite me that sad thing is if you can call it sad is that sa finally started making a poly gun i was considering buying the xde not any more reply yeah if only springfield actually made their plastic fantastic xd’s they’re actually made by another manufacturer in a different country and relabeled and imported by springfield as the xd series of pistols what a joke that promotion started on february st so…no holy t gunway has even less patience than me reply that’s how you hurt sa and rra don’t go after them go after their distribution pipeline once the orders dry up it may be time for a principled member of the gun community to buy up their operations at the bankruptcy fire sale given the current climate i guarantee that they are financially leveraged to the gills shut down their distribution pipeline for a couple of months and they go under reply httpswwwgooglecomampsbearingarmscombobospringfieldarmoryrockriverarmsopposegundealerlicensingactamp folks at bearing arms don’t seem to like ttags reporting on this…………… reply bob owens is rowing with both oars out of the water wonder what nom de plume he’s posting under defending the despicable duo sarra reply maybe bob owens is getting sponsored by sa aor rra… at this point anyone who supports either company is a sellout to the a owens shows off freebies he is sent last was a cz check his site lots of industries give out free stuff for good reviews amazon vines is an extreme example reviewers like this rave about stuff to keep freebies rolling in bob o likes springfield bob o hates open carry what else can we say about bob owens reply check out the latest missive from bob owens httpsbearingarmscombobosensationalistmissingpointillinois he goes fullon deepthroated fluffer for rra  sa while badmouthing the braying lynch mob ttag for trying to reveal the facts shorter bob “hey it’s politics that’s the way the game is played” to which i say f that attitude and fu bob reply but earlier they stated the same as ttag… httpsbearingarmscomdavidlspringfieldarmoryandrockriverarmsselloutillinoisffls wtf reply i am michael bloomberg and i endorse this message reply bob owens the new dick metcalf reply as much as i understand the contempt for sa and rra and notwithstanding the fact that they deserve to get bit in the  for their selfserving sellout truth is that losing either or both of those companies would not be good for illinois gun owners and the other truth is that neither of those companies is going anywhere despite what we read here and on other gun blogs  of gun buyers don’t know about their politics and will buy their products or not based on the product not the politics reply companies like this who enable ndamendment restricting legislation are a cancer reply we’ll see i would rather see gun companies leave il the state is broke and more high profile companies leaving would hurt the state pols more than the citizens plus the smart folks already are putting il in the rear view mirror reply “more high profile companies leaving would hurt the state pols more than the citizens” ‘scuze me how do you figure regardless what happens to what’s left of illinois industry madigan and the rest of the chicago criminals in springfield will keep getting elected by the entitled idiots who have voted for them forever if sa or rra leave get bought out or go titsup honest hardworking freedomloving american citizens in henry county employed by these two companies will be unemployed and the local economy would be thrown into the crapper sheesh take an economics course curtis in il if sa or rra leave il then those “honest hardworking freedomloving american citizens in henry county employed by these two companies” have every opportunity to “vote with their feet” and follow them to another morefreedomloving state did you miss that part in economics class maybe you’re right but wouldn’t it be uesful to hurt them a little so that they take that into consideration the next time they make a business decision that adversely effects their customers reply if the bill passes losing them does present a hiccup for il gun buyers since there won’t be a “zerorated” major left to choose from other than that i fail to see the cost to il gun buyers but i may be missing something living outside of il as for the gun buyers who don’t care about politics they might not but when distributors refuse to carry them the  won’t be able to buy them and that means buying something else new or buying used – both cases resulting in  towards sarra coffers calling for boycotts is pretty meaningless i agree but shutting the pipeline will kill a manufacturer reply that’s all well and good but after the deal the nraila cut with the texas legislature this week i’m not sure that’s the organization i’d donate the money to paul reply if you are an nra member call them today and urge them to take action against the illinois bill the idea of sarra proceeds going towards fighting those very companies is perfect reply i just replied to the nraila guy that emailed me the alert about the bill asking if he was aware of sarra involvement in supporting the bill and what specifically henra was doing to spread that newsworthy item reply yep the nra isn’t about the a anymore now it’s about their instructors instead of the individual they refused to answer any of my repeated attempts to get answers about their ‘a’ ratings of tennessee politicians despite those same pols killing proa bills in subcommittees i called and emailed and the best i ever got was “we’ll have to get back to you” i’m no longer a member i’ve joined the goa and we’ll see how that goes reply kudos to them for taking the stance time for us me to order something from gunway in support of this effort reply i heard they’re having a huge sale on xds 😛 reply still not interested never will be unless free reply i checked their site the sale seemed pretty lame reply springfield better dump the ifma this week if they want to see the end of the year reply that’s going to be tough…sa and rra are the ifma so that smell is going to linger reply actually that makes it easier dissolve it fire their lobbyists claim plausibly deniability and start over with new names reply deniability is only plausible if their lobbyist doesn’t have documented communication with rra and sa that shows they knew what kind of deal he was going to cut i’m not saying that such documentation exists but the fact that he hasn’t been thrown under the bus yet does seem a bit suspicious they are the ifma dennis reese springfield ceoowner is the president and his dad i believe is the secretary springfield and rra created the ifma are the only companies associated with it and run it the ifma is comprised of four people from those two companies plus their paid lobbyist reply even if they dump ifma the bill is still in motion unless they can defeat the bill in the house or governor office i don’t see how they could possibly get the stink off for years to come reply  selling troubled inventory at cost can sometimes be a benefit to the seller sure beats taking a beating on it  were they already giving that much a year to ila or is this a one time donation if giving large donations to ila was already part of their business practice that’s reason to buy from them in and of itself reply hi fedup springfield pistols particularly the xds were a popular seller for us even with their recent actions we have no doubt that some people will still buy springfield products there may be a slow down but selling product at cost is lost revenue for us but we feel it is the right thing to do in terms of the donation to the ila this will be above and beyond our normal support of the nra and nssf we will be following up with ttag on the donation once our inventory is liquidated thanks dan hall ceo gunway reply thanks dan reply thank you dan for making a stand yes this will be a financial loss to you since you already cut a check to them for the stock you have at least this will move the product out of your store and you can stock it with something different it is my sincere hope that more retailers will follow suit it is time we as a market wake up and pay attention maybe we can get distributors to cut off supplying california yes i am stuck here behind enemy lines as long as the leo’s and state government don’t feel the inch then they will continue to do what ever they want if retailers and distributors stopped doing business with them then they would act yes it puts our leo’s in a bind but what other way can we force the politicians to change their minds they have a super majority at the moment reply dan get them to stop suppling california leos and departments with any firearm that is not legal for a legal resident to buy le are civilians and do not have any rights over other residents this is the type of thing that stresses the militarization of police any product for martial arts use that is legal to police should be legal to all californians this includes batons numchucks shocking devices and containment devices like shackles handcuffs etc sap gloves and the like are not legal here but there are officers that have them in different departments higher capacity mags even stock mags that came with the gun as well as the gun should be legal for all we can not even get many cr handguns because the mags hold more then  rds if you use a mag made for another gun that holds  or fewer rds it really affects if they are still crto other collectors and maybe even the atf sadly i can not buy a cz8 because of the  rd mag unless i want to purchase a cz8 mag that holds  rds i can’t even get one with a disassembled mag so that i could make it a rds some of us may not think that the nra is the best choice but i thinknwe all agree that what you are doing is outstanding we can only hope that other retailers will follow suit best of luck going forward and the utmost respect to you reply some of us may not think that the nra is the best choice but i think we all agree that what you are doing is outstanding we can only hope that other retailers will follow suit best of luck going forward and the utmost respect to you reply thanks for taking a meaningful stand on this issue reply thank you dan as a resident of illinois i am used to being betrayed i will tell the many fb groups i belong to buy from you too reply well done dan reply hey dan i’m about  minutes from pompano florida  don’t see any listing for your shop where are you thanks reply excellent may they not be able too make a buck in the usa again we are too support them as they sell out us deplorable s they probably donated too the demonic party of jackass’s as well the only bad part is the workers have too suffer for the big wig wank bs reply funny how gunway’s cover image on their shop page happens to feature that hideous “grip zone” xd mod httpsgunwaycomshop reply hi travis thanks for pointing that out this situation and springfield’s actions have developed very quickly we immediately pulled our physical sa and rra inventory down after ttag’s last post i will ensure that we pull their product down from our website as well dan hall ceo gunway reply you sir rock reply dan are you the fellow who was quoted last week as saying you pulled them off the shelves to get people to stop heckling your sales staff about the sb sellout what’s the general consumer market looking like for springfield do you think this is likely to cost them lasting pain andor insolvency reply hi fedup our two stores didn’t see any push back from the original il bill although to be fair our stores are not located in il i imagine il gun consumers feel much more strongly i don’t think this debacle will hit sa or rra hard in their pocket books most gun consumers will be ignorant of their actions but they do have a fullblown pr nightmare on their hands that will make other brands take notice and that is at least something dan hall ceo gunway if you pulled your inventory how are you going to get rid of it “they do have a fullblown pr nightmare on their hands that will make other brands take notice ” just ask united american airlines was very quick to publicly change eg increase their own reimbursement policy for overbooking after the united debacle came to light this episode might make other oems  lobbying groups a little more sensitive to who and what bills they support going forward couldn’t hurt as an illinois resident i want to express my sincere thanks for your willingness to take a stand even if it means you loose revenue good luck to you and thanks reply i am now going to have to liquidate my ownership of an nib sa ma loaded and go procure a james river copy reply if it’s liquidated by fire lostatsea is kinda suspicious would firearm insurance cover it although now i suppose that saavy insurance types will now view all claimed total losses of sa and rra firearms as suspicious lol reply the springfield is a copy too and a less faithful one at that springfield armory inc is not even a descendant of the famous springfield armory and is not even in springfield reply why so the nra can sccrew ya with carry insurance reply i prefer texas law shield myself reply i prefer uscca reply outstanding reply kudos to gunway reply they should donate to the isra instead to more fully offset any damage done by rra and sa reply some aclown on mahogany row dicks up and then lets the shareholders and employees eat the sht sandwich so he doesn’t have to admit his wrong doing and fall on his sword to save the others reply i wonder if hs produkt in croatia knows what’s going on yet on the bright side it’s a fine firearm someone will rebrand it stateside and keep the lights on in karlovac reply dunno they signed a longterm contract with sa in  according to this page httpwwwhsprodukthrenaboutus maybe someone should give them a headsup before their contract gets renewedrenegotiatedwhatever they seem to make a decent product shame for them to suffer for the apparently duplicitous actions of a business partner reply that “long term” contract likely has a contingency for when one party voluntarily sticks their penis into a hornet’s nest might be smart for competitors to quietly reach out to them… curious to know what the sa range officer dealer cost equals consumers near their physical stores are in for a super sales day reply one sa choice at the moment httpsgunwaycomproductspringfieldsfloadedacpshparkerizedwctclasergrips reply i don’t think they’ve got the ‘at cost’ price posted yet  seems like more than cost assuming it’s upc 8 that you linked i found that at buds for  and impact guns for 8 reply that escalated quickly i imagine if the ruger and smith betrayal had occurred in this connected information age neither company would have survived reply escalated  out of approximately  us gunshops i’m not ready for the escalation word don’t get me wrong i support gunway but if i owned a gun shop i would sell whatever guns customers wanted source httpswwwindycomarticletherearemoregunshopsintheusthanstarbucksmcdonaldsandsupermarketsputtogether–wnpivyg8b reply  of hs produkt’s production is exported to the us httpwwwhsprodukthrenaboutus talk about putting your eggs in one basket reply in the realm of civilian firearms sales there is only one basket reply ha too true well said reply was just at the lugs watched two sales people walk customers right past springfield armory pistols and on to glocks and sigs wow i don’t know what they are going to do with their stock but it doesn’t seem like they are too keen on selling it when one of the patrons asked about an xd the sales person said and i quote ” oh those you don’t want those” reply is it time for springfield to hit the panic button yet  i think so this is bad reply i do feel bad for the hourly workers who could lose their jobs because of the stupid actions of some idiots in the big offices as usual the innocent will suffer while the top execs will get huge buyouts if the company is liquidated reply there is a lesson for all gun manufactures get out of antigun states eventually you are going to be forced to make an accommodation with the powers that be and the wrath of the community will put you out of businesd reply sure they should all do what magpul did right meanwhile henry is in new jersey sturm ruger  co is in connecticut mossberg is in connecticut smith  wesson is in massachusetts savage arms is in massachusetts springfield is in illinois there must be reasons why they stay where they are reply i think ruger is hq’d in prescott arizona says so right on their guns they may have another plant elsewhere reply and barrett is in california henry is in bayone new jersey of all places mossberg is in connecticut kahr is headquartered in new york but i think they moved their plant across the border into pennsylvania beretta usa is in maryland and remington is in…no one cares where remington is so your point is politics doesn’t seem to be too much of a reason for major gun corps to pick up and move their factories elsewhere reply barrett hq is located in murfreesboro tn right down the road from me it’s a lotta fun to take that tour beretta fled md for tn henry is also rice lake wi barrett is in tennessee as is beretta certain companies have union shops which require timing to extricate themselves from some are as simple as the ceo’s wife doesn’t want to move regardless none of them have pulled a backstabbing antind amendment move like sa rra ifma maybe they got promised illinois le contracts for their treachery they should be nuked from orbit just to be sure the resultant craters serving as signposts for other manufacturers contemplating sleeping with the enemy beretta’s hq is still in maryland i didn’t know ronnie had pulled up stakes this is really a reply to all and i bet if you look hard enough they have all made accommodation with the powers that be at some point reply only ruger headquarters are in ct manufacturing is done at newport nh prescott az mayodan nc there is some speculation that mayodan will be new qh in the future all versions of american rim fire some american center fire all ar all sr all sr  pistols the original style lcp not the ii are nc products also is their call center and home of shop ruger nh is revolvers and other style rifles az is semi auto pistols excluding the ones made in nc general consensuses is that when the people in ct will retire that plug is pulled reply henry may be in nj but they sourced many of their parts in wisconsin and are now manufacturing many guns in rice lake wi gun friendly state my guess is that they are hedging their bets for the future you can be sure that having long time employees and lots of families with ties to the area like many folks they are hesitant to uproot and move away i’ve exchanged emails several times with the president anthony imperato he actually contacted me first over a website issue i’d found he’s got his priorities straight doesn’t explain the other mfg’s but suspect it is like the frog in the pot that is slowly heating up most are just sitting there trying to make do not realizing they are slowly getting boiled to death change is a hard thing to paraphrase “the duke” it’s even harder when you’re stupid” hopefully as you point out more mfg’s will move out of gun unfriendly states reply gunway is going to donate a bunch of money to the largest antigun organization in the us that’ll teach ’em reply they’re progun if you’re either one of their instructors or if you pay their instructors for the privilege to own a firearm reply drain the blood from their veins then sent in the vaulters rip apart what is left and make good use of it maybe someone actually believing in the a starts a new company on the ruble that will be left reply both springfield and rra immediately distanced themselves from the il law and both said they were not aware that they were being given special consideration and were not consulted about it beforehand i’m thinking we should all be giving them the benefit of the doubt even if it turns out that they did know ahead of time and distancing themselves was simply a response to all the bad press they got we should still give them the benefit for the doubt because it will be in effect “rewarding them” for responding to the “gun community” quickly and appropriately rewarding them for this will make them less likely to go along with anything similar in the futurea sort of “lesson learned” thing reply awesome reply leave a
