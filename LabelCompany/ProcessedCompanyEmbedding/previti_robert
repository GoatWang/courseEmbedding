governing the types of evidence that can be presented to a judge or jury the main reason why evidence is ruled inadmissible is because it falls into a category deemed so unreliable that a court should not consider it as part of a deciding a case for example hearsay evidence or an experts opinion that is not based on facts generally accepted in the field evidence will also be declared inadmissible if it suffers from some other defectfor example as compared to its value it will take too long to present or risks enflaming the jury as might be the case with graphic pictures of a homicide victim in addition in criminal cases evidence that is gathered using illegal methods is commonly ruled inadmissible because the rules of evidence are so complicated and because contesting lawyers waste so much time arguing over them there is a strong trend towards using mediation or arbitration to resolve civil disputes in mediation and arbitration virtually all evidence can be considered see evidence
