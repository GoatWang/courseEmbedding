real professor katherine baicker please stand up dec    share facebook twitter by al lewis and vik khanna  harvard professor katherine baicker is arguably most acclaimed health policy researcher at arguably the most acclaimed and not even arguably the bestendowed school of public health in the country her seminal account of the effect of medicaid coverage on utilization and health status is a classic as luck would have it in 8 oregon used a lottery to ration available medicaid slots a lottery controls for motivation and as such eliminates participantnonparticipant bias since everyone who enters the lottery wants to participate that meant only one major variable was in play which was enrollment in medicaid or not chance favors the wellprepared and professor baicker jumped on this research windfall she found that providing medicaid–and thereby facilitating access to basic preventive medical care–for the previously uninsured did not improve physical health status but did increase diagnoses and utilization because of the soundness of the methodology the conclusion were unassailable – more access to medical care does not improve outcomes or optimize utilization which is a proxy for spending we ourselves reached a similar conclusion based on a similar analysis on north carolina medicaid’s medical home model yet professor baicker herself used exactly the opposite methodology to reach the exact opposite conclusion for workplace wellness  and that’s where the identity crisis begins she and two colleagues published a metaanalysis in  of participantvsnonparticipant workplace wellness programs somehow—despite her affinity for oregon’s lottery control—she found this opposite methodology to be acceptable  she concluded that workplace wellness generated a very specific two significantdigit to roi from health care claims reduction alone with another to from absenteeism reduction the title of the article–now celebrating its fifth anniversary as the only work by a wellcredentialed author in a prestigious journal ever published in support of wellness roi—was equally unambiguous  workplace wellness can generate savings this article wasn’t just an academic exercise it gave the obama administration academic cover for what has proven to be the most unpopular dishonest and even hazardous component of the affordable care act  allowing employers to financially and clinically punish employees with coercive directives to lose weight get unnecessary checkups and answer intrusive distasteful and counterproductive questions about for example checking their testicles professor baicker did not question her toogoodtobetrue conclusion yet the law of diminishing returns clearly contradicts her finding compelling privately insured people to get more healthcare is very unlikely to improve health status and reduce healthcare expense if provision of basic insurance to a medically needy population doesn’t noticeably improve health status while increasing healthcare expense instead she reveled in the limelight receiving  citations vs 8 and  for two other health affairs articles on wellness that didn’t support more spending on vendors and consultants even  citations aren’t enough to satisfy one of the leaders of the wellness movement larry chapman who says this study should be cited much more frequently since it’s basically the one that supports the entire industry however at some point in  overwhelming evidence totally invalidated her findings at that point – like dee edington and al lewis both of whom had previously reversed positions when the data didn’t support their previous positions—she could have acknowledged that her initial findings had been wrong and moved on instead she neither defended her position nor clearly refuted it choosing instead a yin and yang middle ground that shifted with every interview the metamorphosis from queen of significant digits into the queen of significant doubt started in july  when she announced on npr’s marketplace that “it’s too early to tell” if wellness saves money and that employers need to “experiment” with these programs to “see what happens to participants’ weight and blood pressure” right there she invalidated herself first by then she certainly knew that a participantsvsnonparticipants methodology was invalid since the key “smoking gun” slide in our health affairs posting was already widely circulated and her own opposing oregon methodology was being widely praised second even if she is right the financial payoff for the modest “weight and blood pressure” improvements that the best programs might generate is  years in the future — and even then only if the improvements are sustained but then came another personality change in february  she blamed readers for focusing on her attentiongrabbing headline the certainty of her two significant digits and the gist of the conclusion…while ignoring the fine print such as a caution about publication bias publication bias you think start with the standard publication bias that negative articles rarely get published because they don’t get cited and hence reduce the allimportant “impact factor” – recall the difference in health affairs citations in her own wellness article vs the others add to that a publication bias specific to those journals  most of the articles comprising her metaanalysis were published in thirdtier journals among them these journals have exactly once published an article critical of wellness twice if you include a book review by the esteemed norton hadler whom a thirdtier journal is thrilled to publish regardless of what he says and three times if you include publication of an article by a graduate student at the university of tasmania that accidentally undercut the true believers’ own storyline that they are now having to explain away weeks later a totally different personality emerged  she told the editor of insurance thought leadership that she no longer focused on wellness and consequently has no opinions to share  leaving aside the irony that the wellness true believers continue to cite as gospel someone who says she has no interest in what they are citing her for this spin further invalidates her next comment delivered in december  – when suddenly as a result of yet another personality change she has opines again she told all things considered “it could be that when the full set of evidence comes in wellness will have huge returns on investment” oops first she has just admitted she doesn’t follow wellness so why speculate on future studies she has no knowledge of in a field she’s not involved in second there is a rule of thumb in epidemiology  the bigger the impact the smaller the sample size needed to discern it an example would be smoking and lung cancer a previously very rare disease whose cause was discernable from a handful of cases a sample of only hundreds of veterans was needed to prove that very high blood pressure causes strokes and studies of exercise almost always show either a physical or emotional benefit even in small groups of people with significant disease on the other hand there have been probably close to a halfbillion employeeyears of wellness with nothing to show for themselves except results going the other way and a bunch of selfinvalidating vendor lies so we are going to make a radical proposal to the true believers  you can continue to cite katherine baicker but must also note that she herself no longer supports the study you are citing — until and unless she says she does in exchange for this disclosure when do you cite her we will acknowledge that you are telling the truth for a change al lewis and vik khanna are coauthors of surviving

connect with you must be logged in to post a comment guestsoeren mattkejan  gentlemen great post like you i am disappointed that researchers of the caliber of kate baicker and david cutler do not respond to the mounting debate about their paper they should defend or disown their work rather than hope that the debate goes away in my mind their paper is a product typical of highend academic research two brilliant professors spot a gap in the evidence on a hot policy topic and decide to go after it but the actual work gets done by a graduate student in his cubicle without windows or guidance and then hastily published then the problem arises that the paper becomes hugely influential and people start having a closer look for our paper on the pepsico program we reviewed in detail the seven publications that baicker and colleagues called “high quality evidence” we found that five of those analyzed programs that operated over  years ago and most of them had severe methodologic flaws john p caloyeras hangsheng liu ellen exum megan broderick and soeren mattke managing manifest diseases but not health risks saved pepsico money over seven years health affairs  no  unfortunately many defenders of the industry continue to take the baicker paper at face value while closely scrutinizing or ignoring more nuanced and scientifically sound findings so i herewith support your motion

affiiated with us or ron but is familiar with both viewpoints httpbloghopehealthcomwhyistheresomuchmediaexposureaboutthefailureofworkplacewellnesslatelyanallewisandvikkhannaalertp    share              guestal lewisjan  so many targets so few electrons on the internet… thanks for the headsup– we’ll take a looksee at mr robbins but we just need to get current business taken care of and mr robbins may be bogus science but invalidating bogus science requires actual talent whereas invalidating most vendor statements requires only knowledge of fifth grade math which most of the industry seems to have been absent for this posting is not that situation in this case it’s just a question of a very talented and accomplished researcher perhaps assuming that wellness vendors did understand basic arithmetic and not realizing that most of wellness is so ridiculously bogus that you can’t assume that peerreviewing things in wellness promotional journals means anything as she could have safely assumed in a legitimate corner of health services research so doing a metaanalysis of bogus papers just gives a very bogus number still i don’t know why she didn’t cutandrun a long time ago like i did when i realized my own advocacy of this activity was sorely misguided this posting was more so that all professor baicker’s comments are in one place that way when the wellness ignorati cite her again and we have already drawn their attention to this posting which we have we can point out that they know they are misrepresenting the situation to date we have only been able to speculate that they are misrepresenting the situation since all of her recantations were in different venues    share              guestcivisisusjan  i find lewis  khanna’s wellness gotcha games as amusing as anyone else does – still god help me – but i’m starting to wonder where it’s all going wow wellness is not physics and there are people who will enthusiastically overpromote the value of its grabbag of concepts  tactics – who without al  vic’s help would have guessed eyeroll if you want to take on bigtime smokemirrors purveyors guys at leastr train your sites on bigger targets – i hear tony robbins has dipped a toe into the wellnesshealth care pool…    share              guestal lewisjan  steve thanks for your thoughts someone is clearly listening to these researchers and other wellness ignorati the “wellness ignorati” are people whose business depends on making sure facts are ignored– wellness programs are ubitquitous discussed at the white house and a major agenda item for the business roundtable for reasons that elude me since presumably they do have an internet connection by the way one other comment was tweeted but not posted we were attacked for this “personal attack” the irony is that the person who attacked us didn’t do it publicly perhaps having learned the fate of attackers from shapeup dr kumar how’d that work out for ya httptheysaidwhatnetshapeup  however unlike shapeup’s personalitydriven selfindulgent rant this other guy raised a good point that we would be happy to address why the personal attack first it isn’t a personal attack–we have great respect for her primarysourced work and called her the  researcher i would love to be attacked like that second all we are asking is for her to answer the question does she support her own to or not one could argue that the fate of the industry depends on this answer the wellness ignorati have cited her  times and that’s just in journals — try googling “wellness” and “” so i think it’s a fair question the ignorati have no other legitimate academic source–they sink or swim on to finally i did write to her directly twice in the last few months and got no response before going public likewise before we posted columns showing that the koop committee completely lacks the ability or willingness to identify phony outcomes when they give out awards to their sponsors we wrote to some committee members ahead of time to point out their incompetence and ask them to address the mistakes before going public even rachel carson didn’t go public until her protestations got totally ignored by the chemical industry    share              gueststevejan  i don’t understand the comparison between blood pressure or smoking and wellness programs wellness is something being designed it is a product and it is going to change over time in a market economy you’d hope it’s change for the better improving since businesses will learn and adapt to earn and keep business i know it’s optimistic but we teach this stuff to freshmen so i sort of believe it blood pressure and smoking on the other hand are not going to evolve to have a different impact on your health not much anyway i think that is part of what baicker means when she says “all the evidence is in” right now wellness programs probably do suck on average but will they always suck does they all suck or are their positive deviants we can learn from that said i get it that wellness backers aren’t promising results some day they are grossly overselling the benefits of their product which is their job similarly researchers are grossly overselling their findings and that is their job but does anyone actually listen to these people    share             hide replies ∧guestvik khannajan  in fact you can follow my exploits in this wellness debacle here httpkhannaonhealthblogcomthebellyofthebeast    share              guestvik khannajan  is anybody listening i’d say so my wife and i are embroiled in her employer’s wellness program for simple reason that not participating was too onerous financially this large employer with a wellness program run by a major league well as major league as a wellness vendor can get anyway vendor who is a litigant in at least one major case we know of is a pokeprodprypunish program that would make kate baicker proud because apparently nothing makes her contrite    share

share              guestbob hertzjan  this is indeed an important post…almost like a new rand study let me make two points  medicaid probably reduced debt a lot it may also have extended life spans by earlier detection of some cancers that is about all that most health insurance does  i had to chuckle about absenteeism if a firm wants to cut absentees all they need to do is go to hourly pay and limit sick days try to run a school district for a year the number of sick days is stunning despite good health insurance    share              guestal lewisjan  hey guys thanks very much for taking the time to comment on new years day a couple of things first just to be clear the rarely cited papers were not specifically refuting hers but rather refuting workplace wellness generally but your point is a good one regardless second as a democrat vik is a libertarianrepublican so we don’t have a political agenda about wellness i do want to make clear that there was wellness before obamacare came along the aca did raise the stakes quite a bit for god knows what reason i think it was to mollify the business roundtable which has not wavered in its support of the wellness provision no matter what the data says their position reminds me of what stephen colbert said about george w bush’s consistency “he will believe the same thinkg on wednesday he believed on monday regardless of what happened on tuesday    share             hide replies ∧guestvik khannajan  in defense of my own political affiliations i am not a republican in fact i find the major leadership of the republican party as repugnant stupid and ineffective as most of their peers across the isle i am an independent conservative with a libertarian bent that clarified bob’s point about government approval being a marketplace propellant is right on nothing can advance the pointless like an endorsement from the clueless but powerful    share              guestsaurabh jhajan  sticky research the point about the number of citations of the original paper versus papers that have subsequently refuted the findings is an interesting phenomenon in its own right    share              guestbob merbergjan  hi gents this is an important post while i do not know prof baicker and can’t comment regarding her personal actions or motives i do as you may know share your exasperation with her flawed wellness study and the way it was swallowed — hook line and sinker — by the wellness industry if anything i think you’ve understated the case as you don’t mention the phrase that was repeated in the study “medical costs fall by about  for every dollar spent on wellness programs” which is more absolute than the study title and in my analysis was wholly unsupported by the data presented in the study findings i’m hoping you can elaborate on a matter that is more incidental to this particular post — namely the straight line you draw from obamacare to socalled outcomesbased wellness programs certainly it is true that aca “allows employers to financially and clinically punish employees with coercive directives” and this inclusion in aca is inexcusable but readers of this and other posts who might not know better may conclude that the obama administration invented these programs as you know aca expanded the permissible limits of these incentivespenalties — from  to  of the cost of coverage in some cases more — that were established in hipaa in  prior to pres obama’s election don’t get me wrong by the very inclusion of these programs in aca and by expanding permissible limits pres obama and aca endorsed these programs and presidential and gov’t endorsement is powerful but readers would be served well to understand that outcomesbased programs were around long before aca or the obama presidency and they were codified in government regulation in hipaa during the administration of pres bush ironically in light of the recent eeoc lawsuits the  hipaa codification of outcomesbased wellness was dubbed “wellness exception to hipaa nondiscrimination provisions” the rand workplace wellness programs study p xx suggested that at the time the study was conducted “the average amount of results based incentives for these employers who used socalled outcomesbased models was less than  percent of the total cost of health coverage” which could bring into question whether raising the permissible limit from  to  really had such a big impact in my opinion outcomesbased programs are nothing but an unfounded desperado move on the part of employers as such isn’t it possible that they would have continued to see uptake from desperate employers even in the absence of aca and is it correct to pin these programs on aca when aca simply modified something that already was enacted and had already attracted the interest of employers i look forward to your response for those interested in the hipaa wellness provisions which were enacted during pres bush’s administration and how they were expanded in aca under pres obama’s administration i direct you to the federal register at httpswwwfederalregistergovarticlesincentivesfornondiscriminatorywellnessprogramsingrouphealthplansh     share

quite sure what hit them – they have purchased and implemented a number of systems sometime more than once in the last several years and now are waking up to the reality that that might not be enough or even the right set of technologies for the emerging payment models  return on investment is hard to show debt used to finance purchases along with stimulus funds are coming due  system after system

prove to be a check on fullscale repeal family physician found dead in pool of alphabet soup reality  it is challenging to remain in a small practice today  there is an ever changing set of requirements and initiative from payers and from government entities and it can all sound like a pool of random letters  for example macra is now in effect and yet surveys show that many providers

reality  for all the talk about consumer driven healthcare there seems to be little change in the position patients find themselves  there remains little pricing information payment terms and coverages are difficult to understand for the average reader and health savings accounts aren’t much other than a new form of deductible for insurance companies  most consumer online tools provide little utility other than providerout reporting  patients continue to have difficulty getting access to medical records in any useable form  mobile applications seldom exist and when they do few if any are on par with the experiences of other tools like uber amazon snapchat or facebook  it’s bad enough if you are reasonably healthy it’s worse if you are trying to manage a chronic illness  you

intelligence and analytics to transform their business models healthcare providers are looking for opportunities to catch up the challenges to digital transformation in the healthcare industry are significant but the opportunities are tremendous as applying modern analytics can dramatically speed and improve quality of care while also creating opportunities for new revenue streams and customer retention take for example the transformational opportunities presented by applying analytics to electronic health records ehrs by applying a layer of advanced analytics to ehrs providers can identify areas for improvement and opportunity which is especially important when you consider that these insights can anticipate outcomes and inform actions that can directly affect and improve the standard of care analytics aren’t just improving the quality of patient care they are creating entirely new revenue opportunities in the healthcare industry medigain for example which provides revenue cycle management services to medical practices hospitals and other care providers was able to harness advanced analytics to combine data from  sources to deliver ondemand revenue management analytics to their clients as a result reporting time was reduced from weeks to near realtime greatly improving client performance while earning medigain  percent roi these are just a few examples of healthcare companies leveraging their data and analytics to transform their businesses these services are no longer optional offerings nucleus research confirms that customers are demanding accessibility to analytics in their daily workflow meaning that organizations need adapt and offer these solutions in order to remain competitive gooddata recently partnered with anne moxie sr analyst of nucleus research and ian maurer cio at medigain to create a webinar that features the latest strategies and tactics that healthcare companies are using to turn their data and analytics into a profit center
