share by caroline gabsewics by caroline gabsewicsstaff writerwhen someone first meets edie ames and finds out what she does for a living they may be a little surprisedames is the president of morton’s the steakhouse and has been for the past two years her name is one thing that can confuse people only if they don’t know how to say it properly her whole life people have mistakenly called her “eddie” when it’s pronounced edie as falco or brickell“i get letters all of the time for ‘mr ames’” she said “it makes me laugh my brothers still call me ‘eddie’ so i am used to it”ames also said she doesn’t let the perception that she is a female in a man’s world get in her way“i don’t focus on being a female” said ames “it has never stopped me“my board of directors expect the same thing from me that they would expect from a man”ames  doesn’t see herself as someone who always aspired to be a president of a company but rather someone who has worked hard to get where she is today“i’m not a climber” she said “but i have been very fortunate that things have happened that way for me”ames hasn’t worked her way up the chain within morton’s but she has been working in restaurants since she was a teenagerames grew up in chicago where morton’s is based and began working as a waitress at bakers square at the age of  her management career began in atlanta at a restaurant called malone’s she then moved to los angeles where she was the vice president of operations and training for california pizza kitchen she spent  years at california pizza kitchen before she got the call from morton’s“it is a people industry it has grown on me and i have never left” she said “it is funny though how this morton’s brought me home”ames got the job with morton’s after her predecessor was asked if he knew someone who would be a good fit for the highend steak house chain“he asked him if there is anyone he would recommend for the job” said ames “and the gentleman suggested me“i was very happy i got that call and we decided to meet for dinner at the end of dinner i knew i would be joining morton’s”ames is happy to be at morton’s and says there are plenty of reasons she enjoys overseeing all  locations“our culture and first and foremost our people are incredible” said ames “we have unbelievable tenure we are celebrating our th anniversary next year and we have people who have been here for    years”ames said every time an employee celebrates an anniversary with the company they are recognized“they can bring a guest with them to chicago we put them up in the ritz carlton and we have dinner at the restaurant” she said “it all comes from the family feeling that lives with the organization”ames also said their product quality is second to none and they know how to build relationships with their guests“it all goes right back to the people” she saidwhen ames became president she set a goal for herself to get to know her  employees and a little about what they and their guests want to see at morton’s part of that goal was to visit all  of morton’s locations including the two in canada and the one in singapore in six months those six months turned into two years“it was a priority of mine” she said “i needed to get through the tour because it is important to get a feeling from each of the restaurants“i wanted to understand what their culture is about and they told me what they thought needed to be done in the next couple of years”the changes made at morton’s — whether it’s the menu decor service or employee benefits — the ideas all come from the employees and guests of morton’s“that is how we run our company” said ames “everything comes from listening to the employees they are the ones that hear it on a daytoday basis”some changes included new menu items that the guests are asking for and others included different employee benefits“you hear things from your employees  or  times and if you don’t take care of it then you aren’t doing your job” she saidnow that she has completed her “tour” changes are being made and ames plans to scale back her traveling“i am going to continue to do that visit the different locations” she said “not as often though”ames was on a mission to get the feeling from each restaurant the visits weren’t inspections but rather an opportunity to experience each morton’s and what makes them unique depending on their location during the visits ames meets with the hourly employees and then the management team“i get to know them pick their brain a little about what they love and don’t love and we talk about guest comments” she saidames was in jacksonville on aug  visiting with the employees just as she did at the other locations this was her first trip to jacksonville’s morton’s as well as her first trip to jacksonville“i was thoroughly impressed” she said “i loved the restaurant and what is going on around the restaurant but most importantly i loved the staff“they are passionate and friendly”so are there plans for a second location in jacksonville“you just never know” said ames “we are always looking for new locations”even though ames was only in town for a day she said it was good to see the amount of growth in the area morton’s is on prudential drive next door to san marco place and across the street from the strand and the peninsula“there was a tremendous amount of growth — a lot of growth around my little corner of the world” said ames “i feel the area will continue to grow”ames just celebrated her st birthday and likes being back in chicago where she grew up ames’ husband works for cosi a restaurant very similar to panera and they have two rottweilers as well as nine nieces and nephews that keep them busy“my husband does the same thing i do so he understands the work load” she said “it’s not easy but he understands we have a great dog sitter too”ames said she is very content these days“the fact that i was suggested for the position — i love what i do my people and my company and i am looking forward to moving into the future” she said prev article missing next article missing prev article next article related stories view the discussion thread the cheesecake
