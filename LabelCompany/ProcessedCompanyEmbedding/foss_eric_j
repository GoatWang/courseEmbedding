pepsi as ceo punishes exec responsible for brands collapse comment share tweet stumble email last updated sep    am edt pepsico pep has finally removed massimo damore as ceo of its global beverages group three years after he began a disastrous selfindulgent makeover of pepsi that has left the brand in tatters he is replaced by al p carey former ceo of the fritolay north america snack food business although pepsis press release states that damore will retain responsibility for gatorade tropicana and latin american beverages thats a decidedly secondrung portfolio and he now reports to carey instead of directly ceo indra nooyi its a demotion hes banned from meddling with pepsi anymore and nooyi wants to see a whole lot less of him in other words the enduring legacy of the damore era will be pepsis humiliating slip from no soda to no behind diet coke as i noted in june the company has spent so long in a series of management shuffles that management shuffling is now at the heart of its strategic problems this most recent shuffle  its at least the th reordering of senior executives since   was accompanied by the departure of eric j foss ceo of the pepsi beverages company who was only given that title in february 0 the company said fosss departure was contemplated by the terms of his agreement to which the only rational reaction can be what idiots appoint a ceo to their most important most troubled brand knowing hell leave just a few months later welcome to pepsi so what happened many of the answers can be found in a  business week story that described the arrival of damore pictured atop pepsi and his decision to destroy as much of the brands heritage as quickly as possible the scene openson oct   nooyi and damore were in venice for meetings during a break she asked him to walk with her in the gardens of the hotel cipriani would he run the beverages unit she asked on the verge of the biggest recession in a generation nooyi and damore were swanning through venice like characters in a merchant ivory movie damore decided he wanted the seven brands he supervised which included  different bottles cans and other packages redesigned before the super bowl of   a deadline that meant everything was rushed and there was no time for premarket testing they called in wacky design guru peter arnell to handle the new logo and packaging for all pepsi brands and tropicana the move was disastrous for tropicana comical for pepsi and arnells overreaching ego and lack of results led ultimately to him being fired from his own agency by holding company omnicom omc groupthink sets in by this time damore nooyi and arnell were talking only to themselves bw reportedwhen damore and nooyi invited arnell in to talk cola no other pepsi marketing people were present nooyi knew exactly what she was looking for the ipod is an elegant product people like to be seen with she recalls telling arnell i want pepsi to be an elegant product people like to be seen with arnell was jazzed they chose a new target marketthe demographic of people who march to the beat of their own drum who say no even when its unpopular who say yes even when its an uncomfortable change who change a hundredyearold brand icon because the new one is simply more beautiful and fitting for our times translation having completely divorced themselves from the average american consumer raising a family on an income of about  a year far from the cipriani venice they decided that pepsi should be about themselves soda is a dollarstore grocerycoupon business its also good for diluting rum and bourbon yet somehow damore et al concluded that elegance was the key to the brand the news of damores passing followed a  percent volume decline in north american sales of pepsis carbonated soft drinks in q  damore also cancelled an appearance at the sept  barclays investor conference in boston mass because the company said he was recuperating from minor surgery i guess he needed stitches after removing nooyis shiv from his back related pepsi just cant stop pulling the tab after shaking up management how pepsi lost its facebook war with coke grief at gatorade facebook

went public what has driven our success from day one until now and will drive our success forever is a relentless entrepreneurial spirit with a total focus on and obsession with customer service what does customer service really mean and have expectations changed customer needs are constantly evolving great customer service organizations have a mindset to always let the marketplace set the table

what customers expect most is service that is rooted in innovation and is meaningful to them – value quality and ultimately delivering a great and consistent experience that requires us to have a

the world is literally our industry’s oyster about 0 percent of the businesses we serve are selfoperated and have yet to be outsourced this is especially the case in our healthcare education and business  industry sectors this provides a sea of opportunity for us to continue to spur increased outsourcing and that opportunity exists worldwide – irrespective of geography looking at the opportunity more closely the healthcare and education sectors are highergrowth opportunities for us geographically emerging markets present a tremendous opportunity for growth for example we already have strong businesses in china and south america that are primed for continued growth these geographies will be key to our future while we keep expanding in more established and developed markets is there a growing international awareness of the value aramark can bring it’s an education process it is becoming more apparent to many leaders that no matter what their core business may be a top driver of their own customer’s satisfaction is the food service offering it’s the fourth most important reason for instance why a student selects a university or college so our products are extremely important – not just to our customers but to the ultimate consumers it’s a real opportunity for organizations that are attempting to do this on their own when it’s not their core competency whether they are a hospital a school a ballpark or an office they can view outsourcing as an avenue to improve the overall experience of whatever they provide that leads to a renewed and added loyalty from their constituents who matters most additionally with increasing costs weighing on businesses whether its wages or benefits like healthcare coverage it is becoming increasingly important for organizations to look at outsourcing as a key opportunity for saving money and improving their customer’s experience in the end outsourcing is the ultimate virtuous circle enabling a business to excel
