grew up where you were born az sure absolutely i grew up in boston born there in a suburb called medford and i spent most of my life there went to universities in the boston area majored in physics and ee i grew up as one of two children a younger brother  months younger than i was parents born in europe my father was born in greece mother was born in greece also they came to the united states and they picked up their lifestyle and worked very very hard to give you some examples of some of the things that were important to me when i was growing up my parents grew up in a twofamily home and never owned their own home to this day my parents never owned their own home so i grew up in a relatively poor environment but clean clothes good food and had access to good universities and certainly musical instruments so my father and mother gave me a full value upbringing so as i progressed in my life i really began to appreciate the things they did for me growing up as a young person but it was real experience and a great environment to grow up in the boston area ca did you have any strong interests growing up like was the electronics thing something that happened early in your life az actually engineering more than electronics when i grew up my father was very interested in cars…and mechanical engineering he later became a watchmaker when he first started in the united states he worked at a clothing store called scott’s it was a high end store and he was a designer of clothes and designed clothes for president roosevelt the pope and a number of other famous people and when the industry shifted from manual designs to automation cutting clothing with band saws he decided to leave and at the same time he was working as a jeweler repairing watches at home and so again he was mechanically inclined and he then took on and opened a jewelry store and progressed from that point so i guess between the cars and his knowledge of mechanical configurations it sort of just rubbed off on me so engineering was an important part of my life and i think mainly from him ca can you talk about your first job whether it was in the industry or not az yeah sure it wasn’t in the industry my first job was in  working as an associate physicist at a company called avco it was aviation corporation and it was interesting because at that time i received three offers one was xerox one ibm and this company called avco and what impressed me about avco was one of the operations was close to my home in medford and they would give you a free cup of coffee and doughnuts in the morning so that was really interesting to me and it was the lowest paid job offer i had and xerox and ibm were higher paid but it was more interesting to do the research work that they avco were espousing that i could be doing and the work was in plasma physics and they were working in the area of shock tube mhd magnetohydrodynamics and doing work with wind tunnels so i was very intrigued by that so i became an employee of avco in the physics department and spent four and a half years of my life in that area doing research mainly on air force contracts some of the work we did was to work on reentry vehicles doing ablation studies we did work in propulsion for space and did some real work in simulation of radiation from atomic weapons because they’d banned surface testing of atomic weapons so we simulated radiation impact in a laboratory it was really a great learning experience for me to get a cross section of many disciplines but the fundamental discipline was in the area of gas discharges plasmas ca this would have been during the height of the space race and the cold war az that’s correct yeah it was in that time frame in the ‘ time frame it became clear that they started cutting back on defense spending this organization this one facility that i worked in had 0 people in my group we had  physicists and it was a great experience but at that point funding began cutting back so i at that point decided maybe there was something better in my life than working on rd contracts for military applications not that i’m opposed to military but i felt that there was a great learning experience and i began looking for the next part of my career and learning how effective and good some of these phds were that i worked with i realized that i wouldn’t be in the top  to  percent of that environment so i decided to change my career path at that point and back in that time frame we used vacuum as a tool in terms of wind tunnel testing and reentry vehicles etc so we used vacuum and i decide to leave the rd environment and move into the industrial world and that’s when i joined gca in the middle of  ca when you joined gca was that in the semiconductor operations or the other side of it az actually back then gca stood for geophysics corporation of america they were doing a lot of work in areas other than lithography as we know it they did a great deal of work with the black lung disease in mining and that’s how they began from cambridge the air force and mit they then expanded to other fields of endeavor one was in the vacuum field they had a company that they owned that did a lot of work in vacuum metrology vacuum heat sintering for carbide welding for nuclear reactors for submarines and aircraft carriers so i went there and i actually left and went backwards in a sense for a title back in the s it was an honor to be called a physicist but when you go into the real world the apparent feeling back then was that physicists really don’t do anything really worthwhile so i actually took a 0 percent pay cut in  to join gca within six months i was making more than i was making earlier so it worked out really well but i went actually as an ee an electrical engineer and decided to go backwards a little bit and get into the real world and that lasted for some time maybe a year and a half and maybe in the ‘ julyaugust time frame we were a small company gca was  million in sales and traded in the american stock exchange so it was a small family organization headquartered in bedford massachusetts a few miles away from where i was and they began looking at other areas of technology and back then there was a technology called sputtering and we certainly had that problem in reentry vehicles and space propulsion where the cathodes were eroded by sputtering so during this period of discussions with the chairman of the board and ceo milt greenberg we got into this issue about sputtering this new technology and i tried to get away from plasma discharges i tried really really hard and it lasted for about a year and a half and then he asked me to look into it which i did and then we built the first sputtering system back in  and at that time mrc was the principal architect of sputtering back then today it’s pvd but back then it was sputtering so i then began developing technologies involving back to my gas discharges again the only difference was that the discharges i was dealing with at gca were cold discharges where at avco they were hot discharges but the principles are quite similar ca so was the sputtering work at gca through an acquisition or inhouse az no it was all inhouse we built our own power supplies back then it was a hartley oscillator kind of a cute story to relate to that is i built this hartley oscillator our power supply and for people that know hartley oscillators you don’t control the frequency it just wanders and it wanders from maybe 0 megahertz to 0 megahertz but in that region which is not the ism frequency band of  megahertz or you’ll get interference in television radios etc and when i actually turned on these machines these sputtering systems and adjusted the matching network manually and got the discharge going there’d be neighbors calling and channel  would have no audio and channel  would have no video so i was actually blocking out sections of this location and then they became really smart they began understanding about the fcc and i became very frightened so the lesson is get involved in shielding so back in that time frame this whole technology was brand new and we were doing some very interesting experimentation that later evolved into the first solid state power supplies that i helped develop and also the whole rf power supply industry i was instrumental in developing the structure for that through this gca operation but did the first  kilowatt   0  kilowatt rf power supplies and worked with henry radio in california at the time and also some real good work with a company called cca communications corporation of america in pennsylvania so really that was a pioneering day it was a lot of fun a lot of hard work a lot of burns and discharges on your finger from the parasitics and the matching network but that was all part of the fun of this era in time back in the ‘s and early ‘s ca can you talk a little bit about the device industry during that period what sort of requirements they had or what sort of challenges you had dealing with them az yeah the applications were quite different back then people tend to forget that in that time frame the basic technology was nmos and pmos and bipolar certainly and very high current devices and the other thing that’s startling when compared to today is the yields were very bad yields were typically in the  to  percent range in the s and it’s hard to fathom today that we talk about yields of 0 percent and back then it was  to  percent you’d actually have a party when yield went from  percent to  percent it was a very big deal and also in that time frame i became acquainted with hank smith who currently is a professor i guess retired at mit and got involved in some work he was doing at mit lincoln labs in xray lithography in  i also became enamored with a flip chip technology that ibm pioneered the c process in the s today it’s becoming more and more important part of my life and the industry especially consumer product area but ibm pioneered that and these were kind of the fun days in the chip industry where yields were bad technology was really learning where you didn’t have computer designs we used ruby lith big cameras it was just very interesting…lithography was contact printing sputtering was five inch targets wafer size…i began when the wafers were three quarters of an inch in diameter so the evolution was kind of interesting ca could you talk a little bit about milt greenberg the ceo of gca he was a real character from what i’ve heard pretty difficult to work with what were your impressions of him az milt greenberg i thought had good points and bad points as everyone does and his good point was he was a risk taker he began gca with several other associates i guess the bad part of milt was he had a foul mouth a phd with really a foul mouth in mixed company he would use unbelievable fourletter words and after a while it just sort of bounced off you milt also i think was really the creator of gca and probably the individual that destroyed it also so he made something and he destroyed it and he destroyed it by not focusing and he did things that i think were not smart he didn’t listen to people he was afraid to make the right kinds of decisions and when he made decisions for the most part toward the end of the…in the ’s time frame these decisions were not good ones they ranged from the acquisition of tropel which was good and the bad part was they bought some land they tore down the football field and bleachers to build this large facility to do world optics this was the star wars games and he was going to be the star wars leader and the people in rochester were really angry with him for taking down their football field nothing was ever built there and the state of new york helped fund it these were kinds of decisions…an inventory for service that was absolutely way beyond its time and automation robots that were just far beyond what anybody really required but he wanted to do something different and really didn’t focus on the corporation of course later it failed miserably and began dying i believe in ‘’ ca so after the sputtering work at gca what did you do then az well i left gca in  so i spent about 0 years there and i moved on to a company called lfe laboratory for electronics during my tenure at gca there was a senior executive herb roth who was a westpoint graduate a great leader herb left and ended up running laboratory for electronics and he tried several times to get me to go to work with him at lfe corporation and i kept rejecting it in ‘ coming back from semicon west i was at a low point at gca and mainly it was funding for rd projects i felt that in order for us to be successful…we needed to spend more money in developing the pvd technology and i wasn’t given the support that i thought was necessary to be successful there and when i came home on the overnight flight herb had called i had breakfast with him at the sheraton hotel in ‘ at that point he asked me to come again and i decided to make the decision to go to lfe corporation again money has never been my object in life so i was making at that time 00 a year and i went to work at lfe for 00 a year so i didn’t leave for more money…i left mainly because of a challenge and the challenge there was in a plasma etching environment and plasma stripping of photo resists in gas discharges again cold discharges again i couldn’t leave this field most of my life at that time had been spent in plasma discharges and i went to run a division and to really grow the division and we did that i had a great team of people and we grew the division which represented only  percent of the revenue of the company and  percent of the profits and we grew that and when i left there in  we were no  in the world of plasma etching technology and sales and there were at that point  companies in the world and applied materials had just entered that market and i left lfe with a backlog of about  months and we were shipping in the range of 0 to 0 systems per month these were quite inexpensive these systems were 00 to 0 each so the industry has really grown but again the essence of the technology is very very similar to what it was back then but we were producing systems that would have throughput of a couple of hundred wafers an hour for 00 to 0 and it really was an interesting environment to be in at the time ca when you first went to lfe and started working in plasma etch was that a really immature industry az yeah it was it was very immature the industry really began in the late s a fellow who worked at signetics used an asher and these ashers were used to remove organic materials in samples for trace analysis applications it was done right here in richmond california and it was owned by lfe corporation it was called an asher and some people still use the word ashing today and others use the word photo resist stripping but its removal of organic material so steve irving was the fellow who pioneered the work and took this asher and started stripping photo resist materials and when i arrived at lfe corporation one of the big issues back then was contamination they felt plasma was damaging the devices as it turns out it wasnt plasma it was actually the photo resist back in that time frame kodak was the principal supplier of photo resist they had this resist ktmr and kftr and these resists were interesting in that they had tin organics in the resist so that when you removed all the organic the tin was left behind you went to a diffusion tube and you diffused the tin in and it destroyed the devices and they would be blaming the asher or the stripper for that they called it plasma damage the fact was it had nothing to do with the plasma so it took years to recover from this tin issue from kodak resist back in the s so when i came in it was just beginning to clean up that part of the issue then the first application of etching was using it for gate nitride… to remove very thin layers of gate nitrides the earlier method was using hot phosphoric acid with an oxide mask it was splashing burning people very expensive really a bad technology so we replaced the hot phosphoric with silicon nitride using a cf plasma discharge rather than just oxygen so that began in the early s and really grew at that point to more and more different applications poly silicon came later aluminum came later oxides came later ca and what was your competitive advantage at lfe with your plasma system az size of the company lfe was a major size corporation the principal competitor in silicon valley was called ipc international plasma corporation which became gasonics and that is now owned by novellus dick bersin founded that company he did a great job and so these two companies really did a terrific job in promoting the technology and dick did especially a great job in japan where lfe did not do a very effective job in asia lfe did a better job in europe and i think looking back now it was mainly the location where california being close to japan and boston being close to europe it was just natural to evolve to areas of more comfort so dick did some really great work in japan and in the united states in california and these two companies were “onetwo” for many many years and as things happen people change their jobs and people make mistakes and lfe as i mentioned was number one in  and then after i left and they ate up the backlog it then just virtually disappeared ca was that very daunting to you that there were  competitors out there az no not really i really have confidence in my ability and i dont have any fear of competition i look at my strengths and weaknesses as i do my company and i take the appropriate action so i dont fool with myself kid myself tell myself stories that arent true most people do i dont and i build on my strength… i get good people against my weaknesses and i dont really need more people in my strengths so ive done that all my life and i really dont have any fear so having competition that type did never bother me even today it doesnt bother me its just that youve got to pick a strategy that fits what you can do and what you can accomplish and some of these strategies may be to pull back a little bit which we did at ultratech when i came here but some of these strategies are not to be number one in certain markets but maybe a niche player in certain markets so youve got to evaluate the core competency core technology how good you are the staff you have working for you the timing the competitions power and once you get that all together you can come up with really a good solution to solving technical problems and business problems ca and at lfe were you in a management position az yes i ran a division and also directed the marketing and the engineering function of the operation ca so you would visit customers az yes sure ca i imagine you came out to the west coast as well so what was your perception of the differences between the semiconductor device makers on the west and east coast az i thought everybody on the west was the land of fruits and nuts i came from boston where we had a lot of culture we had the symphony new york had great plays offbroadway close to europe you know the european heritage and the perception is that people in california are crazy they do funny things they smoke funny stuff haightashbury was going on so its a land of fruits and nuts so you just stay away from there so id come in the weather was great but every time i came it rained so i said theyre going to give me a lot of crap about the weather so this is really the land of fruits and nuts totally the weather included well i learned later that wasnt true so my first impression was i can come into california i can be there as often as i need to and still be effective in boston well that was not true you cannot be effective in california living in boston and if you look historically the companies that have succeeded and failed in this industry more companies have failed in the boston area than have failed in california by percentage so we have gca we have so many companies that have just failed we have a few left that are doing well such as teradyne but virtually nothing is the way it was in that area so to be successful if youre in boston you can do a good job if your market is in europe but if your market is in asia you cant be in boston the time zone is absolutely crippling and the communications the networking is not there you drive 0 0 miles between competitions customers or competitors here in california you can change jobs and stay in the same carpool so its a whole different lifestyle change and so i never really appreciated the value of california networking when i was in boston until i actually came here i thought visiting california would be enough and it wasnt enough ca looking at the time you spent at gca and the time you spent at lfe what were the things that you learned in both those periods az i guess the technology part was something that i just brought with me because i understood the technology pretty well i think i learned in that time frame about a different market different industry and different people and i think i learned and formulated my style of management in that time frame in research it wasnt my management as much as it was doing the actual research work presenting papers and doing studies and getting more air force contracts but once i moved to industry it was a whole different position of the people the customer issues so i think that was probably my biggest education was learning about how to manage people effectively and getting good things from people and then combining those good things with my style so my style really is a combination of all the people ive worked with in my life the good things ive taken from them and ive tried to put those together in my current personality so it wasnt just me its the influence of a lot of the people ive worked with and worked for that i have today in my current style ca did you get involved in any of the design of the products at gca az oh absolutely sure absolutely even to this day at ultratech i get involved in some of the design not to the amount i did years ago so even today i have several patents that are still pending so im still actively involved in inventing if you will maybe some of my people think its distractive that i do that but i do that anyway and im very much involved in the company both in the management style investor style customer style and also from the designing and inventing part of it im very much involved in the technology of our company ca can you talk about leaving lfe why you left and then what you did az sure you always leave because of situations that occur in my case it was never the people i worked with i really enjoyed the people i worked with and worked for when i feel stymied or have a road block…the rd issue came up again before i left lfe corporation i had worked very hard to get additional funding because i saw the potential threats coming with competition and i wanted to move and do some infrastructure work outside the united states and it took me a long time to get  million on the budget to do this and then when i got the money i couldnt hire people to support it so in one hand i won getting the budget approved on the other had i lost because i couldnt spend the money that i had gotten so i decided at that point probably a good thing for me to do is to leave and thats when i decided maybe ill try it on my own and thats when i founded drytek in the  and it was a great experience for me i was ready for that i really had the experience i had the ability the drive the intensity of working many hours i had the contacts in terms of potential investors so i had absolutely no problem raising the money everyone that i went to wanted to do a loan with me so there were 0 people five in europe and five in the united states individuals and companies that wanted to support me i picked the one that i felt was best for the corporation not for me personally i turned down better deals for me but i wanted the best chance of success so this one individual he provided the right kind of format for me to be successful so we were we were very successful drytek in  when i founded the company…in two years we were number three in the world we at that point did no business in asia except for korea so we did work in the united states europe and in korea at that point we became number three out of the  plus companies in the business so we really did a great job i had a great team of people working with me and we brought some real value to low cost designs low cost manufacturing in that time frame…which was the direction that we focused on and then plasma etch primarily ca so for the financing you just went to one individual you didnt want to spread it out az no i thought it would be too difficult managing too many people so thats one of the things i did learn earlier that when you have multiple investors its even more difficult they cant reach a conclusion generally with one person its more challenging but its easier so if i felt comfortable about myself then i have no problem dealing with a single person and as it turned out i borrowed  million from this one individual and paid him back with interest on the money that i borrowed from him and at the end of the day when we sold the company in  to general signal he got a great check and he deserved every penny of it so he was the primary owner of the company i was a minor owner…a portion of that which was still fine for me but he did very very well and i couldnt have been more pleased i wont mention his name because hes still in the industry hes a fairly large person and one thing hes always shared with me is that if ever i want a job to run his companies hed let me do it you never go back and so this would never be something i would consider to go back and to run a company that im running right now this is my last enterprise if you will doing ultratech right now thats the most important thing in my life right now ca was your funder handson in the company az no no as a matter of fact i had to force meetings with him he would have meetings and id say i want to go over the spending go over our sales go over our profit and id force monthly or even in some cases quarterly meetings with him and the first question asked me are you happy do you want more money and we were very happy didnt want more money but he was that kind of person wanted to make sure i was happy and at one point we had bank of boston as our bank and they would come to me and say you have all this money in the bank and how about getting a line of credit to borrow money i never borrowed any money from the bank so we funded this thing individually paid it all back  percent back with interest and as i mentioned a handsome check at the end of the day in  that was a great program for me personally to get him that money…give him a return on investment which i did do so that to me is job security you give more than you get and thats real job security ca when you started drytek was it obvious that you would be in plasma etch did you consider other product areas az no it was plasma etch we felt at that point there were real weaknesses in the industry it was fragmented and we probably thought that was a good idea with my involvement with sputtering pvd in the s and early s i gave that a passing thought but back then companies like mrc randex had come about then varian was a very strong competitor and these were all major companies when we looked at the plasma etch area it was always fragmented with small companies and i thought that would be more of a level playing field in size of companies than to go after the major corporations like a varian or mrc or perkinelmer which at that point had owned randex ca how did you come up with the first product was it built from the ground up az its a great story a great story my first cofounder first employee was joe maher joe had worked with me for a number of years at lfe corporation we went out and we bought two drafting boards and we rented some offices in redding massachusetts and we saw two designs a single wafer design and then a vertical structure with multiple wafers but done vertically that was joes concept mine was single wafer we actually came back to single wafer later but we began with the multiple wafer vertically stacked system and in four months we had a gas discharge going so we sat in an office we moved to a small location in bloomington massachusetts then grew that facility and we kept expanding very very rapidly so the story was a great story in terms of how we started we actually did all the drawings and would go out to the machine shops and do the welding and painting and we did the expediting the purchasing that work was done ourselves…in an office with two drafting tables thats how we began ca so literally the two of you az thats right then we had a secretary and then we started hiring engineers and it grew from that so within about three months we had maybe five or six people and then within a year we were just growing very rapidly at that point shipping probably 0  systems a year and it was just a wonderful experience to start from the bottom up in a company and having a backer that had trust in you that there were no strings attached to the money and if i wanted more money  million it was there available for me there was an open check for me if i ever needed it but i treated the money just like it was my money i was very careful very frugal with the whole business that we started and this was coming from a research person rd person engineering person which in some cases arent too frugal theyre not businessdirected but the experience at lfe corporation helped me considerably in fundamental knowledge of learning how to run a business and understanding that part of it i had some of that before but not as much as i learned at lfe ca at drytek were you close to any device makers az well fairchild was in south portland maine so we were very close with them ibm corporation and analog devices had just begun so we were close with them drytek was in wilmington and analog was in wilmington and dec was there at the time so we were closer to the local companies in the area but we didnt do very much business in california at the time it came on later started renting some space out here california had a sales office but all manufacturing was done back in the boston area ca back then there was probably a big wall between the device makers and the equipment guys and nobody wanted to share intellectual property did you go to these people that you knew and say im building this etcher and what do you think az sure ca what sort of interaction did you have with those device makers az the first thing we did was after we actually had the machine built i put together a six page survey a marketing survey and i went through six pages and asked them a number of questions and most marketing people will tell you dont do that you dont do that you just do five or six questions otherwise you get a bad response what i did was we sent it out to probably  people maybe a little bit more than that and we sent it out to the engineers and the managers and what i found was very interesting it talked about color of paint it talked about software architecture it talked about throughput issues it talked about cost of ownership issues it talked about mass flow controllers pressure controllers it went through the whole thing and i sort of picked apart this program in that it was slanted to what i was building in the sense that the questions were focused on what i was doing and after six pages they could either sign their name or not and what we found was virtually all the people after they spent all this time filling it in all signed their name and they sent the forms back and i told them wed give them at the end a summary of the answers from everybody else so we went back and gave them a breakout as to what percent voted for each of the different areas so they learned what others were thinking and then we kept those in our file so if i visited delco at the time or i visited fairchild i would pull out the fairchild study and look at what they wanted to see went back to reinforce what they did and thanked them for helping invent the machine so we gave the customers the credit for what they had done so now people were buying something that they invented so thats how we used a strategy to develop this technology in the market and gain the acceptance of our product so quickly it was a simple simple strategy in marketing and getting information it was very simple and everyone told me not to do what i did ca what was the great advantage of your machine over the competitors az low cost of ownership this was a machine that performancewise could equal any company in the world throughput was far greater and process control was equal so it gave them a low cost machine a small footprint and high throughput so that was really the core technology which it is today thats exactly what we did and that was the foundation of ultratech which we call the dawn of a new era and we began that in  and i think youve seen that term used elsewhere in other areas since then but i believe we were the first ones to use it in that time frame ca did you make any attempt to break into the west coast market az yeah we did we did that later we hired a fellow who had worked with us before bob hills who is currently working with mattson a very good guy and bob ran our operation here but again we werent big enough to make a difference we were here we got some business but not as much as i would have liked looking back in retrospect i think if i would have made a bigger presence here maybe some light manufacturing maybe an acquisition we could have been what applied is today our technology back then was beyond anything thats even there today so what we see today with lam research and applied materials all my people back then if you asked them this question these companies would not be where they are today if we were in california we were in the wrong location but not the wrong time we should not have been in the boston area we should have been in silicon valley and i kind of learned that later unfortunately when i came to recognize the weakness of the boston location it was a terrible terrible handicap for my company and for many many bostonbased companies it was a big big handicap not being here in california even today the same problem ca can you talk about the progression of drytek as a company how the products grew and how you grew az we began with this multiple vertical stacked electrode and i was talking to my son this morning describing how we got into the first cluster tools we were the inventors of the cluster tools we have a number of patents that were acquired by general signal in  we invented the cluster tool and joe and i were at lunch and were at a restaurant on route  and they make great steak tips i can taste it this morning and were sitting at the table and back then we had a martini when we began lunch it was a typical martini day we had a martini and in the booth there were four white plates and we were talking about productivity and we looked down at the plates and im not sure he or i one of us came up with the concept of the cluster tool with these four plates sitting there and said “gee how about individual process control” because we were having trouble with crosstalk between the vertical electrodes and that discussion was going on…how we can control each wafer without the interaction to another one we wanted separate chambers and we couldnt do it vertically with separate chambers it just was not practical and then when the four plates on the table we said “gee how about a robot in the center with four separate chambers” and thats how the first cluster tool was invented…at a restaurant on route  in redding massachusetts having steak tips so in  we began the whole technology in cluster tools and then we moved into a number of applications not just poly silicon and silicon nitride we moved into aluminum and oxide etching and then began to do multilayer processing we developed a laser and point detection systems and machines that we call the “quad” it was in the front cover of solid state technology showing these four chambers in color and we had the first color graphics displays in the industry back in the early s we called it quad because it had four chambers on the first one it had cassettes bringing wafers in and out through what you see today as a cluster tool and so everything around what we have in our industry again lam novellus and applied and others use that same basic format whether it be for flat panels or for wafers so that work extended until  when i then sold the company to general signal in the summer of  ca when you sold it to general signal how big was it in terms of employees and sales az we had i dont know  to  people we had located in wilmington sales were about 0 million back then we sold the company they came to us general signal came to us and we werent really for sale as a matter of fact my principle backer the fellow i spoke about earlier didnt want to sell it and i felt the timing was right to sell it and i felt that we needed something bigger i was seeing the competition growingapplied materials the size of that company what they could do and i felt size had something to do with it it just was size and location i decided general signal had some presence in the industry a major corporation it would make sense and they came to me so i decided that selling would be in the best interest of the employees and the owner the principle owner and i remembered saying to him “this has been a great experience its been six and a half years weve done this and been very successful” they offered seven times the assets for cash and i thought we should do it and he was reluctant and i said “what is this company worth without me” and he said “ok lets sell the company” and thats when we decided to sell it it was the right thing to do at the time maybe not the right company but the right thing to do the acquisition by general signal was one of pleasure and pain the pleasure was being liquid at that point i could live the rest of my life i had enough money i didnt need any more i dont need a lot of money to live and so the sale was one that allowed me to live comfortably the rest of my life flying coach is fine with me i have no problem with that flying business class is even better but i had no problem flying coach so i had bought my first ferrari at the time in  thats one thing i always wanted in my life was a ferrari to me when i was growing up as a young boy i saw people that had a ferrari and i recognized that that had to be a person that was successful so i measured success by the ferrari so when i bought my first ferrari in  i thought now im successful that was my measure of success other people have different measures that was mine and i had always loved cars i built cars i raced cars when i was younger so it came full circle back to me as something i really cherished a piece of art and something very special but then joining the company general signal i then took over additional companies i ran four other companies for them so i had five companies at one point reporting to me and i actually went back and fixed companies for them and then i felt maybe i could have a bigger influence at the company by being at corporate and at that point the people had talked to me about taking over their international operations and i thought thatd be interesting it would be another challenge i wasnt married at the time went through a divorce in  and i thought at that time in my life it would be something i have time for so i lived in new hampshire my office was in connecticut in stamford and i ran some us companies and traveled the world for two and a half years in that position i averaged eight hours a day on an airplane so i ran operations in japan facilities that manufactured in holland so i had great responsibility restructured the whole operation overseas and it was a challenge and it was rewarding to do that what was not rewarding was the organization and what their philosophy was i remember after i sold drytek i was sitting at the general signal presidents meeting there were  unit presidents and we were sitting there and i was sitting opposite the chairman and he made a comment to me he said “art youre the most recent president we acquired your company eight or nine months ago what do you think of general signal” and the whole table went quiet it was a rectangular table and it all went quiet and i said “general signal reminds me of a company that makes things that rust” and what i meant by that was they would spend  to  percent on rd and those are rust companies to spend money in technology youve got to spend 0 to  percent and they were having a hard time doing that they were doing it but they were doing it very reluctantly so it was just a matter of time before this whole thing would fall apart and i remember when i decided to retire in 0 from general signal i had enough money i had my ferrari i didnt need anything more in my life i had a nice home in new hampshire across the street was the wonderful atlantic ocean which i love and i didnt need anything else my current wife lisa i was with her so i was very comfortable with my life the travel was getting to me and the appreciation of my work wasnt there so i decided to retire and a couple of weeks later ed carpenter called me from general signal chairman of the board and said “ive got this company in california ultratech weve discontinued it would you go look at it for me and make some recommendations” and i had a presidents package so i was being fairly paid for a year and i said “sure” so i came to california and at that point i checked into the marriott in santa clara and i remember getting a fax and the fax was…“why dont you go through and give us your appraisal” so i spent three days offsite had people come in and talk about the issues i knew ultratech because wed been handling the products overseas when i was running the international group and i knew of what happened there i knew that the company was a very good company in the s so i began by looking at the history what caused this problem what did i find and what caused it so i went back and i presented to the executives at general signal and i had all those people in attendance they at first said its not necessary and i said “no i want you there because if i say something you dont agree with i want you to be honest with the management team because theyre making decisions involving people and im very concerned about their decisions” and what i did is i gave a presentation in four parts the first part was what did i find when i got there the second part was how did we get here third was what are the options available and fourth was my recommendation so we went through these parts and it was kind of interesting because i could be absolutely candid brutally frank with them and not get fired when you work for a company at times you really cant be as brutally frank as youd like to and i was i was absolutely brutally frank about what i found and what they did how they destroyed this company and then of course they asked me to go and run the company and i said “absolutely not” and during the course of the conversation they said “well double your pay” i said “im not going to go there im finished with general signal” then they said “well give you an equity position in the company when you sell it” so the deal was i would fix it sell it and go back to boston so i fixed it they couldnt sell it they came to me and said “there is a buyer” i said “great” they said “its you” i said “no” i ended up buying the company with ta associates out of boston i brought the boston connection back in again and mike child here in palo alto was just a fantastic partner as a vc and we bought the company in  we took it public the end of  and ta associates to this day im sure that they were very pleased with the investment they made im sure of that because they got a handsome return on that and i was pleased with them as a company to work with and they added great value to ultratech mike child was particularly helpful in understanding the public market and helping me understand when to raise money so im indebted to mike child at ta associates for his kindness and his working with me he stayed on a year and a half after ta actually sold their position which is very unusual you hear about vc companies how bad they are as organizations and i can only tell you that if you perform vcs are just fine if you dont perform theyre not so good and rightfully so so i have absolutely no issues with vc companies at all because my experience has been very good with them ca you said initially you didnt want to sell the company to general signal az correct ca at that stage had general signal started building up its other semiconductor operations az yeah they did they were fairly large at that point probably two or three in the world they had a number coming…they had electroglas which is part of the xynetics group then they had the hampco capco spitfire crystal pulling saws and polishing equipment so they began exploring more and more in that area and they had ultratech in the lithography area so yeah they were moving since the early s they acquired ultratech in  so that was part of the xynetics group although ultratech was founded in  so yeah they became more and more intrigued with that group and that was the founding chairman of general signal and it changed later…where people didnt understand the technology and it shifted and in the time frame of the s dave kimball was the second chairman he was very good he ran leeds  northrup which was a great instrumentation company but a great great name later shut down which was a tragedy so dave kimball is the individual that ran it and at that point there was some stress between he and the board of directors and they brought in ed carpenter who was formerly the president of itt i dont know what his role was but i heard that he was pretty instrumental in shutting down some of their semiconductor operations and then he took over and changed the scope of the company and at point it was clear that general signal in the early 0s was in the process of dissolving their semiconductor operation and in fact did ultratech was acquired by me and ta associates electroglas was a spinoff it wasnt quite an ipo but it was a spinoff and the rest was just dissolved drytech was then later sold to lam research so lam picked up the actual licensing on the cluster tool so they wouldnt violate the patents on that and so they began to break it apart this company in pieces and it was interesting that neil bonke drove the separation of this and then also ran the electroglas group and i remember in  time frame neil and i walking at the moscone center during a semicon show were walking to have lunch and at that particular moment in time with his company public and my company public our market cap together was bigger than general signal we looked at each other and just smiled here were these two companies that theyd just pawned off became bigger than the company that did it it was only for a short time but it was on a morning walking to lunch ill never forget it it was just a great a great feeling ca why do you think general signal wanted to get rid of the semiconductor operation az again i dont think they understood the business they thought the risk was too high i thought that they felt that the rd spending was too high they were focused on just earnings per share purely and so things like rd spending were very important in the semiconductor industry and as i mentioned earlier you spend  to  percent of rd in companies that make things that rust and you spend 0 to  percent rd to develop new technology high technology and they were really having a difficult time with that and i dont think they really ever understood the value of this potential that was there this wasnt the first time it happened this happened at perkinelmer this happened at varian this happened across the board at so many companies and it was a shame because the industry suffered because of this and if you notice for the most part most of these companies were east coastbased with the exception of varian which was west coastbased but many perkinelmer gca general signal these are all east coast issues again i think not really fully understanding as i didnt fully understand the networking issue the power of silicon valley and what really needed to be done to make this thing really successful ca you said before you had five divisions that you were responsible for were they semiconductorrelated az yeah they were they were in the crystal pulling capco hampco kayex and drytek and then the international operations ca and you were traveling a lot to japan az as i mentioned i was traveling for two and a half years eight hours a day on an airplane for two and a half years so i was doing the whole world every week essentially sleeping in my home in my bed two nights a month at the maximum and being at the corporate office maybe one or two nights a month and the rest of the time i was in the air i was working in the airplane i was having meetings when i wasnt there and then sleeping short times but i didnt realize in terms of jet lag people said “do you have jet lag no i dont have any jet lag” well when i actually retired in 0 i realized i had constant jet lag so when i retired the two weeks when i was just not doing anything i really began feeling so much better and i didnt know i felt bad because it was two and a half years of really feeling pretty bad but i kept driving myself and working over  hours a week every week just constant working because work was my life my hobby it still is i love my work…its a pleasure to have a job that they pay you for doing your hobby and thats what theyre doing for me but yeah i was traveling everywhere all over the world japan ive been there more than 0 times europe more than 0 times i currently go to asia six to eight times a year now two week stretches so i spend a weekend when im there but ill visit two weeks at a time when im in asia in japan ca i guess you were going to japan during the period of trade friction in the semiconductor industry az yes ca that must have been a little bit difficult flying into japan with that sort of atmosphere az i dont think it was as difficult as maybe for more political issues i was very friendly with the japanese for many many many years so i never had an issue i was going to japan since the yen was  to the dollar so the people that were friends of mine even during the friction portion in the s never really looked at me negatively at all so i never felt that and i think primarily due to the early relationships i had with them and the trust i had even to this day many of the japanese executives that i knew back then still have the same feeling about me…that im very proamerican but im really a balance person i care about people so even though im an american and the fair trade issues came up i never really used that we would talk about it at dinner with executives asking me my feeling and asking my opinion but i tried to be as open and objective and talked about if they put themselves in our position and reversed the roles talked about that we didnt understand they have no natural resources and their resources were their people export much like we hear today about china its the same kind of thing as an export strategy for a country thats beginning to grow so dumping is an issue it was an issue back then but the japanese are honorable people and i never ever had any issues with any japanese person even through the very difficult time ca how did you go selling your equipment into japan was that really a challenge because of the mentality of buying japanese equipment az i did it through trading companies back then so it was pretty common to go through a marubeni or to go through a sumitomo or a tel at the time that was a common method we weren’t large enough to provide the infrastructure and the cost to do that at that time one thing we didnt recognize with some of these major trading companies is that they would buy the product from you and resell it to the end customer a couple of bad things one was that you didnt ever have to touch a customer you were there but you were always with them with a customer so they were controlling essentially what was going on and so you never really had that oneonone customer relationship there was always somebody in between the other part was the markup they would mark up the equipment  percent and  percent and by doing that they could justify building equipment in japan so one of the methods was it cost three times more money we can do it here cheaper lets build and thats how they developed the infrastructure in japan in terms of where they are today for export miti helped fund that and again it was the survival issue understand during this time frame where people are talking embargos the japanese became very fearful of that what if the us wouldnt ship any more equipment to them so they tried to be independent and keep their technology going so the equipment industry helped them do that we heard the same thing for a short time in korea and were going to hear the same thing in china were going to hear the same exact program where the chinese are going to feel that if something bad happens and the us will then stop shipping or the japanese will stop shipping theyll be forced to develop an infrastructure in china to protect the possibility of any kind of embargo so thats going to be going on in the next five to 0 years but i never really had any problem in japan ca during the time that you were going to japan was there much of a local equipment industry there az no not really nikon just began in the early s it was mainly through us companies through trading companies tel was principally a trading company and most of these companies were dealing with primarily us some european companies mostly us so applied started later because of their epitaxial reactor having a direct operation there but very few companies could afford based on their size to have a direct operation there as we get larger we can begin doing things like that and understanding the real value of having a direct operation there but that came much later for many many years we were dealing through trading companies ca so you really think that the fear of not having access to us equipment was the impetus for japan to develop its own industry az and the cost driven up by the distributors so reducing cost doing it internally and the government supporting that for infrastructure purposes so miti would support funding…like nikon to build a first stepper with the intent of exporting and developing technology in japan and protecting themselves in case of an embargo so all those factors and justifying that with the x multiplier that was being generated by the distributors ca turning to europe now europe is not really a major force in the industry these days but what was your perception of the european semiconductor industry during your travels there az i thought europe was going to be a powerhouse i thought philips and siemens were great companies i’m very disappointed at what happened in europe especially philips philips should have owned europe and its really a tragedy what happened in europe i think looking back in the history of it and looking and dealing with europe at siemens and other companies i felt that the principal reason is some of the upbringing of europeans the mindset europeans are extremely frugal and they try not to make mistakes so theyll work very hard and try to pick the right decision before they go ahead where in the united states they may go in two or three directions at the same time and spend the extra money and time to market is really critical in this industry and i think that because theyre so frugal and theyre riskaverse that the europeans lost its whats happening now in the united states were becoming more and more riskaverse and thats concerning me as we go forward but europe i think failed for that reason and the biggest tragedy i think is philips philips to me…great technology company great research laboratory good workforce educated workforce consumer products had no reason to fail even though theyre thinking about a spinoff today and forming another company the semiconductor portion of it i think overall historically it was a failure and the same with siemens and infineon as we see whats happening today st has done a great job ask pasquale pistorio he was the driver of st and if it wasnt for him st wouldnt have succeeded but they succeeded by going outside of europe into asia singapore so their successes are not so much within europe its tragic the high unemployment rate in europe today the cost of living so really whats going on today is an environment thats getting weaker and weaker and thats a damn shame i think socialism government policy its just really not good and it makes me feel sad because my parents coming from europe its where i came from essentially but you know its almost selfdestructive not because theyre not smart people theyre very smart people its just they work reasonably hard except now with socialism they work less they shut down in august and really the work week is  hours in some cases less so the work ethic has changed a lot some day it will come back when theyre in a survival mode again but i think europe in general for me has been a disappointment ca did you ever come up against competitors in europe in the equipment space az oh sure electrotech was one chris dobson and electrotech did an excellent job in developing new technology very quickly unlike many companies they could copy something and come out two months later with a product at a lot lower cost i dont think chris was a business man but i think hes a very good technology guy and i have a lot of respect for chris but going through europe for the most part lots and lots of failures asml is an exception to that and asmi is an exception to that but for the most part most of the equipment companies failed in europe they just failed for the same reasons that the chip guys failed ca lets talk about ultratech now after you did the management buyout what were the early steps that you took to get that going az it was just a great program for me i dont think i could have done that early in my career 0 years  years 0 years earlier i dont think i was ready for this i think all the years of my experience led up to the ultratech solution if you will we inherited a company that basically was very very sick and people cared a great deal it lacked direction it lacked management no vision whatsoever so we went back and started at the bottom right back to basics as to what their core technology was and it took me two weeks with the people that were there i knew what the core technology was but they didnt and once we established the core technology which was reflective optics not x…once we understood that then we started marching off and saying what value does that bring to this product and we said “well why is this good” at that time they were competing with reduction steppers nikons canons and asmls which was a huge mistake back then asml was almost infinitesimal they were almost a failure in the early 0s they were in the same boat as us and willem maris was taking it over from philips and he was on the verge of losing the company in  so we were both in a similar position but he had great technology and a great workforce i didnt have good technology here i had technology but it wasnt equivalent to what the industry needed so we picked our places we said what kind of areas would require this kind of optics and core technology reflective optics and we came up with thick film applications so the first market i attacked was the disk drive area and then we dominated that market and then we went from place to place as a niche market strategy and we still continue to have a niche market strategy and we had just attacked these niches where we had competition that was like us where we werent competing with nikon and canon and i call that not a competitive strategy but a complementary strategy and i created relationships with nikon with yoshidasan nikon’s ceo…and with the people that ran canon i created great relationships with them and not once did we talk about competing strategies always complementary so i picked markets that were niche markets that i could really control and we did a very good job there during the course of the last  years i began looking at ways that we can blow out of this small company position all the way through i maintained a very strong balance sheet i was really concerned about balance sheet to me balance sheet is power and longevity when you have money in the bank its hard to go bankrupt so i forced our company to think about the financial aspects of business and coming from a technology person thats kind of unusual im sure but we have a very strong balance sheet and no debt today but not afraid to risk investments we tried many things and then began this laser technology in  just a few years after i acquired the company a couple of years later i began embarking in this laser technology for at that point junction formation making transistors and spent today probably close to  million in that area it has great potential i mean i really believe this and we have great ip over  patents in this area so thats something we began in  thats just beginning to develop now…that has great potential and then staying with our core technology of reflective optics…with the current laser system we use reflective optics so its the same core technology that we understood back in 0 when i took over the company so on balance its been a great program for me very challenging i was getting into the absolute guts of the company they had no clean rooms it was actually more difficult i think to fix this company than it was to start drytek i think its always easier to create your own problems than to inherit them and we inherited a great deal of problems you can never change a company totally and certainly it has my characteristics in the company today but some of the early characteristics are still there and some of them are very good to have so the company is stronger today than it ever has been financially very strong great technology great products and a wonderful workforce and the true assets of the company are the people ca and you did an ipo with ultratech az yeah did an ipo at the end of  and we did four secondaries after that one was a private placement for the ta associates then we did three secondaries we raised money so the company has done a total of four offerings including the ipo that was done in the end of  about six months after i acquired the company ca was that difficult az i had a great time it was a fantastic experience people really hate ipos and secondaries i love them i thrive on these i go from morning till night with oneonone sessions with investors i love what i do and i share this with the investors so ipos and secondaries for me is a lot of fun a lot of hard work getting there a lot of aggravation a lot of frustration working with the attorneys and the audit firms but during the ipo process it is a great experience and id do it in a heartbeat again i loved it that much ca i havent got your opinion on the silicon cycles in the industry are there any cycles where you really thought im not going to make it through this one any war stories az i was one of the guys who thought these cycles are over were getting smarter and the facts are were not any smarter well have cycles forever and thats good news as i look back on cycles…that creates real value the value i sense is that when you have a very predictable growth thats  percent  percent  percent a year then your pe multiple your stock valuation will decrease because youre very predictable when you have these cycles as we do today with very big hills and valleys i think this gives us a greater value for investors to make money going up and going down so that i think helps us with pe multiples and when the industry is stabilized and mature and the growth is predictable i think at that stage the pe multiples will suffer and the values and net worth of companies will decrease so i think its good to have these cycles surprisingly…if youve got a strong balance sheet and you invest in rd spending a downturn can be helpful to prepare for the upturn if you have a weak balance sheet your worse nightmare is cycles so maintaining a balance sheet to me is critical critical in having any kind of future in this industry ca lets wrap up talking about semi can you tell the story of how you first became engaged with semi az i went to the first trade show in california at the hall of flowers in san mateo i shared a booth with a rep with gca corporation in the early s ive been to every show since then as i mentioned i started in the mid s in this industry so its been an interesting part and a real value added to the world to all the members and the customers having semi as a worldwide trade organization this is my eleventh year on the board of semi i served as chairman vice chairman on the executive committee its been one of the rewards of my life a kind of culmination of all the work ive done earlier and trying to share that and give some guidance to the younger people and to help stan myers semi president and ceo in any way i could during this transition and ive had a wonderful time at semi and i work with the semi educational foundation which i think is very important i spend a lot of time with them semi has been a great part of my life and one that i really cherish ca did you attend that meeting i think it was in  before the first semicon show…a meeting to talk about setting up a show it was at rickeys in palo alto az i was not at that meeting no there was the wagon wheel there was rickeys and there was a third one up on el camino but there were frequented on friday nights i was in the east coast so i wasnt as available im sure if i were here at the time i would have been there but again thats part of the networking that doesnt exist unfortunately in boston that does exist here in california ca do you recall when you first heard about this concept of a trade show for the equipment people az yeah back then…we were doing work in southern california…part of a total electronics exhibition and they wanted to break out from that organization thats how it really began at first i wasnt so sure thats why i split one booth with a rep so i had the gca products in half a booth at semicon the hall of flowers that was the first year and it was only half of one booth because i wasnt sure i went back and i raved to milt greenberg and jim gallagher and others about what i had seen what i had felt i said we have to be there and then we began expanding and gca then was there in greater force in the years to come ca were you involved with semi when they had the big debate about whether to go international or whether to be a us organization az no i wasnt im glad they chose to go international again the unfortunate part those discussions were made when i was living in boston in the s and the s ca during your  years on the board of semi what are the big issues that the association has faced in your view az i think managing the organization is very difficult you have cultural changes you have geographic changes you have time zones and i think thats a major challenge to stan myers and the board i think that theyre doing a good job im sure that one can always do a better job but i think thats something that has to be really worked on…to provide enough independence yet keep the total control because i think once you lose the total control especially in standards the industry is going to suffer and thats one of the things that i think brings real value to this organization the trade show supports the funding however the part that i think is very important is the standards portion of it without standards wed be chaotic in our industry so that brings tremendous value and the trade shows bring value to funding needed things like standards so this trade organization is not just different because its global its different because its standardsrelated and it is global and the shows are used to finance the other parts that make this organization so strong i think thats probably the most important thing the differential of this organization is the standards and being global versus other just trade show companies this is not a trade show company people think of it as trade shows but its really not the trade shows fund the organization to do other good things education standards… things of that type which i think really separate this organization from anything else like it ca all right well thank you very much art az its been a real pleasure talking with you thank you very much also zafiropoulo was interviewed may   by craig addison of semi arthur w zafiropoulo
