protests—and wont be silenced by pepper spray last week he blocked traffic and demanded mayor charlie hales resign heres whats next share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on whatsapp share on tumblr share on linkedin share on google plus share on pinterest by johanna bernhard  published october   updated november   gregory mckelvey doesnt really expect portland mayor charlie hales to quit before his term ends in january but mckelvey isnt going anywhere either the yearold spokesman for the black activist group dont shoot portland has galvanized protesters in the wake of the city council approving a controversial new contract with the police union on oct  mckelvey organized a protest at city hall that turned into a melee with police deploying pepper spray on protesters the next night mckelvey went to facebook and published an open letter to hales demanding the mayors resignation he led an oct  march to hales house blocking rushhour traffic on oregon route e and camping overnight in the driving rain outside the mayors house dont shoot portlands activism during the past week is in some ways typical little beirut street theater but its also been unusually focused and sophisticated—directing national attention to portlands policing and publicly shaming hales as mayorelect ted wheeler prepares to assume office that discipline is partly due to mckelvey a politicalscience graduate of oregon state university and student at lewis  clark law school recruited into street activism by dont shoot portland founder teressa raiford in 0 hes run campaigns in corvallis and portland and also works with portland tenants united he surfaced publicly in portland this summer as a bernie sanders delegate to the democratic national convention in philadelphia next week mckelvey will speak alongside green party presidential candidate dr jill stein at a portland rally first he stopped by ww to talk about why hes fed up with hales how portlands civil rights activism is changing and what he hopes to accomplish ww whats it like to be peppersprayed gregory mckelvey its horrible it hurts so bad you dont know whats going on you start to panic and so people are having panic attacks if it gets in your ears or your nose itll mess up your whole day the images of people being peppersprayed by portland police have gone viral will that change how people see portland i hope so i think that because the rest of the country views portland as a progressive city we have a unique ability to be a model for what a progressive city could be when people see these types of things they realize were not it gives us the ability to possibly change so that we can be that model were one of the most popular cities in the country right now and we have the unique ability to show what real progress could be by not having politicians direct their forces to beat people out of city hall a protester is treated after being peppersprayed at a portland police protest on oct   benjamin kerensaflickr have you heard from the mayor i keep asking people do you think he saw my letter im curious if he even read it i doubt hes going to resign but ted wheelers going to know that if you do things like hales did that people will call on you to resign we do have a lot of eyes on this right now in the city if you could change one thing in the police contract what would it be increase citizen review—that actually matters being able to terminate officers in a way thats less bureaucratic and involving the people and thats not just for crimes but also character issues my no  issue was the process but i would love to see more accountability and also the idea that its because of a shortage in officers is ridiculous the number they throw out of officers that we should have is completely arbitrary and crime is down if you can send officers to beat people out of city hall what kind of staffing crisis do we have did your experience as a bernie sanders delegate at the dnc change your view of politics oh yeah ive always been focused on republicans—like republicans are so bad—but then i began dealing with the democrats here and how our state party tried to silence us i think that theres hope and it can be transformed from the inside but that takes pressure from the inside and outside im going to remain a democrat and after this election ill try and become a precinct committeeperson youre very vocal on social media twitter facebook instagram snapchat do you worry about getting out over your skis with what you say online this is just who i am its not like im going to get caught in a hot mic moment when this is lockerroom talk because my lockerroom talk is about social justice issues all the time don’t shoot portland protesters gather outside mayor charlie hales’ house on oct  joe riedl have you spent any time with older members of the black community like the albina ministerial alliance so i grew up in portland going to black churches and i know a lot of elders from that and i have worked with a lot of the older activists i keep saying black people are so much bigger than black churches our older generation seems to try and run everything through the black church hundreds of people in our movement are led by trans people by atheists by muslims and by people that dont feel comfortable going to a church for tons of different reasons weve been singing we shall overcome for  years im so sick of singing songs i dont even know the words to that song and im not going to join you in singing we shall overcome if you start singing that im going to start marching away from you and im taking my people with me there are black churches for a reason but our movement includes white people and young people and it just looks more welcoming that might have to do with religion in general how do you feel about protesters who show up to provoke the police if i saw that happening i would try and calm that down at the same time im not there to censor anyone elses activism i just wish the media would report it better when one person throws a bottle of water at police it doesnt mean we went out and organized to throw water theres a big difference between people willing to cross the line and get arrested or throw a water bottle versus statesanctioned abuse of power and assault on citizens is part of your job at protests helping people to stay calm a lot of times we have some people that its their first protest especially now when its one of the biggest stories in the city on every outlet they come with a lot of anger thats justified when somebody comes up and starts yelling at them telling them that trump is the best or all lives matter they get upset i view my role as like a choir director if youre a choir director church is going to happen every sunday no matter what and the best way to recruit people to join your choir isnt to go out into the streets and hand out fliers but to sing superwell every single sunday and thats how i see my role in activism im trying to teach this choir to sing and i think the rest of the city is liking our song right now what do you say to the white liberal who is sympathetic to your aim but who wonders about stopping traffic or sleeping at the mayors house i deal with them every single day get to know us talk to us anybody thats ever come and talked with us or myself is like wow these guys are nice this movement is about love they dont hate people they are willing to listen and admit when they make mistakes they just care about this and theyre willing to fight for it if someones willing to stand in one of the worst storms weve had in a long time you have to know that they care a lot about it i understand that being stuck in traffic sometimes is inconvenient but what else is inconvenient being black in portland or being homeless in portland so lets make that not inconvenient and then maybe we can get the traffic flowing don’t shoot portland
