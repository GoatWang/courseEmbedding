right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more
