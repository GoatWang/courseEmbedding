competitive game industry developing and publishing software for an ever changing stream of systems and devices the companys sports games have been perennial favorites games based on hollywood

hawkins iii who was a marketing director at apple and at age  became head of the new enterprise william bingham bing gordon who became the companys director of marketing and tom mott both hawkins and gordon earned mbas from stanford university the decision was made to form a company that specialized in developing and marketing software games for home computers at a dinner with four other friends at hawkinss home ea started with a team of  people and  million in capital from private investors ea was flexible from the beginning developing its software for whatever computer hardware was most popular at the time usually then producing multiple versions of programs to run on different systems eas first product shipped in may  was a software game for the atari  game player but shortly thereafter the market shifted to the commodore system ea readjusted quickly and in october  it shipped six more games for the commodore  computer in  its skyfox computer game designed for the apple ii computer became a bestseller two years later ea began producing games for the new commodore amiga which turned out to be a very popular computer by  ea was investing an additional  percent of each products development costs to retool the software so that it could run on a different hardware system games software in the early s was still a very new industry as personal computers were not yet widespread thus ea took a fresh approach to designing software modeling the development and production more on the entertainment industry than on the software industry instead of hiring computer programmers ea hired software graphic arts designers and project managers it called producers ideas for new computer games often came from freelancers who proposed game scenarios just as independent scriptwriters submit their scripts to hollywood studios if an idea was approved by an inhouse committee the project was assigned to a producer later more of the ideas were developed inhouse but ea continued to consider its software developers artists like movie studios ea produced many games to increase the chance of a success since  ea had acquired marketing rights to software packages developed by smaller outside companies through its affiliated labels program ea even began contracting celebrities especially sports stars whose names and images were added to the software these have included football star john madden basketball players michael jordan and larry bird and chess champion garry kasparov nasas chuck yeager was involved in the development of a flight simulation game unlike many of its competitors who use thirdparty distributors ea took the strategic approach of establishing its own sales force eas salespeople sold directly to such retailers as egghead inc toys r us walmart and target in addition to permitting better control over sales and inventory use of the sales forces helped ea keep better track of consumer trends early on ea began selling its software overseas in   million of its  million in revenues were from international sales in  ea established a manufacturing facility which later became part of what was known as ea europe in langley england ea president and ceo hawkins had begun to spend more time exploring strategic growth plans particularly international expansion and in  much of the daytoday administration of the company was turned over to his newly hired senior vicepresident kenneth zerbe ea went public in september  with a market capitalization of about  million sales that year were  million and net income had shot up from  million in  to  million in  having developed its software to run on a variety of computers by  ea had become the leading supplier of entertainment software in the united states but this market was limited in the late s video game cartridges which ran on special players connected to television sets were proving to be a more lucrative industry because most consumers had television sets but not computers at home in  the video game market was estimated at  billion in sales as compared to  million for floppy disk computer games it also comprised mostly children and teenagers rather than the young adults who used computers this market was dominated by the japanese company nintendo with its own and compatible cartridges accounting for  percent of  us video game sales although ea had begun producing software for some cartridge game companies it did not develop games for nintendos systems ea was unwilling to abide by nintendos conditions which would have involved agreeing not to provide the same games to nintendos competitors such as sega cashing in on video games ea made its major move into the video game market by gambling on an unreleased game player from sega ea did not merely revise but designed entirely new games for segas genesis machine which in  was the first bit video game player available to the us market the bit players were almost twice as fast as the existing bit machines for the genesis player ea worked on eight to ten projects each costing about  for a total product development investment of  million to  million ea shipped its first games for segas genesis in june  although sales of the machines did not really take off until  nevertheless a quarter of eas  sales were from games for genesis the success of the genesis in fact was partly due to the great popularity of eas sports games ea was soon producing about  percent of the games that could run on segas genesis allowing ea to get a jump on the software competition in developing games for bit machines the success of genesis spurred ever higher sales for ea eas net revenue increased  percent from  million in fiscal year  to  million in  largely due to a  percent increase in sales of cartridge games for the sega genesis which totaled  million in fiscal  the following year eas total net revenues were up another  percent to  million with sales of sega games up  percent to  million company perspectives ea has been a leader in its field since the company was founded in  since its inception ea has been a creative leader and today the company continues to innovate and improve interactive gaming it was also in  that ea changed its position and began making games for nintendos bit player for the first time nintendo did not introduce a bit machine the super nintendo entertainment system super nes to the united states until june  at this time however nintendo reversed its policy and began letting software developers revise games they sold to competitors to also run on nintendo machines thus ea suddenly had a broader market for the bit games it had developed for sega in december  lawrence probst who had joined the company as vicepresident of sales in  took over hawkinss post as president six months later probst also assumed the position of ceo which had been held by hawkins who remained as chairman and leading shareholder in  ea originally incorporated in california was reincorporated in

popular games were john madden football nhlpa hockey bulls vs blazers and the nba playoffs lakers vs celtics and the nba playoffs and pga tour in the early s ea took great strides toward further

japanese market and several other asian countries during the year following the establishment of ea victor eas sales in japan increased  percent ea also established a manufacturing facility in puerto

games software for children a category also known as edutainment in december  the eakids brand and division was launched to provide software for children aged three to  learning games introduced in  included ping and kookys cuckoo zoo eagle eye mysteries peter pan a story painting adventure and scooters magic castle eakids had also created versions of its software for schools in april of the following year ea signed an exclusive longterm licensing agreement with the childrens television workshop to produce interactive multimedia software featuring the sesame street characters a  plan to merge with broderbund software which was later canceled would have further expanded eas involvement in the edutainment field part of the reason for eas move into educational software was the aging of the company whose employees were having children themselves key dates  three former apple computer managers establish personal computers game business  company establishes manufacturing facility in england  electronic arts goes public  first major success occurs in the video game player market  video game cartridges surpass floppy disk sales during fiscal year  international sales represent

called a fourway play adapter it was the first device on the market that allowed up to four players rather than just two to simultaneously play a competitive game on a sega genesis game system ea also devised special performanceenhancing computer chips inside game cartridges an even more significant foray into hardware development was eas leading role in establishing a jointventure technology company do inc do was set up to license technology to hardware developers for a next generation of video game players the do interactive multiplayer which had a bit risc microprocessor and a doublespeed cdrom drive ea was the largest of the original shareholders of do with approximately a  percent share other participants included time warner incs time warner enterprises unit matsushita electric industrial co ltd mca att and two venture capital firms ea helped develop dos system software and hawkins who was the driving force behind the venture became ceo of the new company while remaining chairman of ea the do interactive multiplayer permitted quality of sound and graphics that was unmatched for video games played on a television set in  ea was one of the first companies to introduce games for the do format which it hoped would become the new standard for video games in addition to the do cd player ea began developing more products for the pc and macintosh cdrom formats its first cdrom games were introduced in  with the emerging base of computers with cdrom drives in homes cdrom software was expected to be the fastest growing category in the mids as equipment became more advanced ea pursued its hollywood model of entertainment software publishing even further developing more sophisticated software in the fall of  ea formed its advanced entertainment group which brought together animators musicians photographers writers and filmmakers through this venture live actors were filmed in hollywood sound stages and the videotaped performances digitized and integrated into the software ea also began joint projects with colossal pictures creators of the mtv show liquid television advanced entertainment group senior vicepresident stewart bonn explained in a company brochure we want to create a place where artists and craftsmen from various disciplines are inspired to gather and collaborate on exciting new forms and images the resulting multimedia

adults to create these highly sophisticated games ea increased its already deep investment in research and development in  the company was investing  percent of its revenues in research and development up from around  percent the previous two years eas innovative development techniques included its artist work station a computerized means of efficiently designing software and adapting it for multiple platforms ea also came up with new ways to merge computer animation and liveaction video in  the company formed a special group to oversee software development for the bit hardware format involving both the creation of entirely new games and the extensive redesign of existing games each new game for the bit machine cost over  million to develop even if the do were not to become the standard the bit system was expected to be the next trend as sega and nintendo began developing bit game players always looking toward the future ea had other plans in the works including interactive movies travelbased entertainment and access to its software through interactive cable television although electronic arts inc by the mids ranked among the worlds leading publishers of video and computer games software it remained less well known than video game companies sega nintendo and atari which manufactured video game players but produced games only for their proprietary equipment electronic arts continued to focus primarily on software for various manufacturers computers video game consoles or cdrom players the strategy resulted in rapid growth in the expanding world market with earnings increasing  percent annually between  and  a roller coaster ride the video game industry hit a twoyear slump midway through the final decade of the century software companies transition to more powerful systems was rocky limited shelf space for games drove industry consolidation as  drew to a close ea activision and midway games were the players left most strongly positioned to take advantage of a market resurgence according to fortune electronic arts the top sports titles seller brought in  million in revenue for the  fiscal year which ended in march earning profits of  million stock traded at a premium to its peer group to keep ahead of the pack ea had to continue to produce winning titles on the right platform for the times as evidenced by the path of do the ea offshoot failed to find a market for its  multiplayer and ultimately sold the technology electronic arts meanwhile stayed the course the company invested  months and millions of dollars to develop interactive games for sony playstation  which became the hottest toy of the  holiday season electronic arts outpaced rival developers readying six titles for the ps launch and three more by the end of the year according to fortune however the ps consoles were hard to come by depressing ea stock after an initial upsurge the next generation gaming system offered improved graphics a port for a dialup modem or highspeed internet connection and the capacity to run a dvd electronic arts planned titles for microsofts xbox and nintendos gamecube systems in the pipeline industry prognosticators envisioned strong growth for both hardware and software sales over the next two years electronic arts acquired pogocom in  the deal for the casino and parlor card game site estimated at  million broadened eas online market beyond its combat roleplaying fan base the software makers own web site launched in october  had quickly become the most popular among its peer group according to knightriddertribune business news in march  runnerup sierracom was far outstripped in terms of number of players and time spent at the site the perspective of many consumers however shifted dramatically following the september   terrorist attacks on the united states violent games looked less appealing to some others saw a downturn in disposable income during the subsequent downturn in the economy nonetheless eas fourth quarter revenue managed to thump analyst forecasts for fiscal  according to game developer yet all was not rosy for ea the online division struggled employees received pink slips the costly majestic offering scuttled and red it flowed meanwhile rival activision was on track to join eas exclusive club of  billion software game publishers another move proved more favorable than the online endeavor back in  when ea chose to focus on creating games for playstation  forgoing the hot dreamcast console the company drew its share of barbs yet in  forbes called the move a smart one there are now  million playstation s in homes worldwide sega pulled the plug on dreamcast after selling  million consoles in  months in the past three years eas stock has climbed  percent to an october high of  dorothy pomerantz reported in january  madden nfl remained a perennial bestseller and for the  holiday season ea scored a hat trick with harry potter lord of the rings and james bond games ironically hollywood boxoffice receipts fell short of us sales of game hardware software and accessories in  software sales alone rose  percent according to business week online in march  and ea was a beneficiary of the surge posting strong revenue and earnings gains still the online woes continued electronic arts moneymaker the sims launched online in middecember  failed to produce expected results continuing eacom shortfalls prompted electronic arts to consolidate its results beginning in april  ea as a whole kept rolling along anticipation of another strong holiday showing drove ea stock to an alltime high in september according to business week online fiscal  sales hit  billion electronic arts held a  percent share of the north american game market double the share of closest competitor nintendo not even microsoft the worlds largest software developer could overtake ea when it came to its sports game prowess fifa soccer the bestselling game ever and madden football helped ea capture a  percent share of the sports game business according to us news  world report the sims moreover ranked as the bestselling pc video game thus although the industry was entering a slow period in its business cycle ea was expected to fare well supported by the ongoing popularity of its titles the industrys outlook itself appeared bright as younger age groups chose electronic games over television furthermore as the first wave of gamers aged many were predisposed to spend disposable income on new technology and games for their kids and themselves global game heating up at the midpoint of the decade ea continued to seek out avenues of growth the european market while well established afforded possibilities at the end of  ea acquired nearly  percent of french game publisher ubisoft although the move was unwelcome the asian market ripe with potential presented a different kind of dilemma ea titles were on the shelves in china for example but largely due to piracy the company also held out hope for a significant revenue stream from online gaming despite its earlier setback ingame advertising and product placement also showed promise for the industry which generated just onesixth as much as television did through the technique moreover ea had not released a game for mature audiences a significant market segment since  meanwhile  presented challenges the industry waiting out another period of technological transition also faced higher marketing costs expensive licensing agreements and stiff competition according to a may los angeles business journal article publicly traded ea activision and thq all suffered downturns in share price ea specifically was tied to game console agreements which posed a potential financial hindrance as competitors moved into games for mobile phones and handheld devices as  began game publishers were preparing investors for less than stellar  holiday season results citing shortages of xbox  as one cause for their problems the new york times offered another perspective on the industrys situation seth schiesel wrote but the bigger picture for investors is that game publishers in the united states are still almost entirely in the same business they have been in for  years selling new games at retail as a result the big publicly traded domestic publishers are not participating in any meaningful way in two of the hottest parts of the global video game industry subscriptionbased online gaming and tradeins of used games european and asian companies conversely had found success in the online sector in addition gamestop leveraged the secondary market of used game sales into increased profits and higher share value electronic arts moved to buy jamdat mobile in early  for  million jamdat holding  percent of

been showing signs of increasing efficiency in its businessdcf model and multiples analysis show that company may be undervaluedcompany has a good plan about how to work with existing properties and new productsmarket overview the global video game market generated  billion in  it is expected to grow up to  billion by the end of  it is also important to understand how the importance of different segments may change for example the share of “smartphone gaming” will grow from  of the market in  to  of the market in  electronic arts ea is one of the biggest companies on this market based on market capitalization with main competitors like activision blizzard atvi nintendo otcpkntdoy taketwo ttwo konami otcpkknmcy ubisoft ubipa otcpkubsfy stock overview while the maximum value of the stock for the last  weeks was  current value is quite close with  for the stock at the time of the writing the stock has been holding in the higher range  per share since may  revenue growth electronic arts had one of the best revenue growth metrics among its competitors there was a positive growth of  even though there are some exceptional results like activision blizzard with  revenue growth and square enix with  ea numbers are above konami  nintendo  and ubisoft  growth net income change net income growth for electronic arts for the last year was negative  however it should be mentioned that comparison with the previous year is not completely fair ea really used the benefits of negative provision for income taxes in previous year if we choose to compare results for the last year with the results achieved two years ago then we would see a growth of  which is not the most relevant metric for the comparison but it shows that downside is not as strong costs change now we can analyze if the company improved its efficiency on the cost side we see that gross profit margin has been improving over the years from  in  to  in the last year at the same time operating income margin has also shown signs of improvements from  in  to  in the last year the following graphs represent changes in margins for the following years how do we compare these results with the results of the competitors activision blizzard has gross profit margin of  and operating profit margin of  ubisoft has gross profit margin of  and operating profit margin of  we can conclude that electronic arts is more on the positive trend when it comes to the question of cost efficiency dcf model the result of my dcf analysis is presented in the table above in my model i mostly used optimistic assumptions about growth of the revenue and cost efficiency i made this decision for several reasons firstly ea managed to show good results in revenue growth compared to its previous years ea is also doing a better job than its competitors secondly ea has worked well with its gross profit and operating profit margins the company has managed to improve them over the years i do not assume strong improvements in the future however i predict that company will stay at the current level of efficiency in the future given this information my dcf valuation results in equity value of about  billion with this approach price per share of electronic arts is  that is about  higher than its current price sensitivity analysis table of share prices for different values of growth and wacc with different assumptions about wacc and different growth rates for the terminal value price per share can have different values the main range is between  and  comparative analysis there are three different ratios in my comparative analysis evebitda evsales and pe electronic arts currently has evebitda of  evsales of  and pe current of  activision blizzard has evebitda of  evsales of  and pe current of  taketwo interactive has evebitda of  evsales of  and pe current of  nintendo has evebitda of  evsales of  and pe current of  electronic arts seems to be a little overpriced if we look at ebitda multiple however sales metric shows that the company may be a bit undervalued value of pe multiple for ea is also one of the lowest among these several competitors we can conclude that ea may not be seriously undervalued however it has a potential to grow comparison of multiples for ea and main competitors new products and launches in the future electronic arts owns several key franchises in the video game industry it also has plans to create several new names one of the biggest and most famous conferences in the video game industry is “e” many companies share their plans for the future there including ea first of all ea presented one of the dlcs to its successful brand “battlefield ” secondly it worked on its “fifa” and “madden” projects and added new features to make these series look fresh those series were reproduced every year in the past with just slight improvements in graphics thirdly it gave a new chance to its “need for speed” franchise with a new spin on game play and style ea also has offered several new names like “a way out” from a studio with successful previous project and “anthem” from an experienced studio bioware finally ea presented “battlefront ” a sequel to a commercially successful game this time it offers a lot of new features for example a more complete storymode and wider multiplayer experience recommendation in my opinion electronic arts despite its ups and downs with revenue growth is one of the most efficient companies on the market ea has been improving its cost margins for several years dcf valuation shows that company has potential to grow analysis of multiples for competitors also shows that company may be undervalued from qualitative side company also shows that it knows that it needs to work with both existing properties and new

acquisition of several successful developers by the early s ea had become one of the worlds largest thirdparty publishers on may   ea reported  billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending march  and on january   ea announced that it had exceeded  billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year in a note to employees ea ceo john riccitiello called this an incredibly important milestone for the company ea began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site pogocom in  in  ea acquired the londonbased social gaming startup playfish and in june  ea launched origin an online service to sell downloadable games directly to consumers there is also a on the house feature in origin that lets you download full versions of ea games for free it is updated regularly in july  ea announced that it had acquired popcap games the company behind hits such as plants vs zombies and bejeweled ea continued its shift toward digital goods in  folding its mobilefocused ea interactive eai division into other organizations throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale –  the beginningedit founder of ea trip hawkins in february  trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc where hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capitals spare office space to start the company on may   trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated us the company was not named amazin software but instead electronic arts seven months later in december  hawkins secured us million of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sevin rosen funds electronic arts original corporate logo – for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capitals office in august  during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october   by november employee headcount rose to  including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in  including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late  and helped the company sustain growth into us million in its third full yearcitation needed this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december  david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october  hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that the company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein  partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleepcitation needed hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordons suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film troncitation needed when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying were not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsedcitation needed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of eas trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with eas packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling ea routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous fullpage magazine ads their first such ad accompanied by the slogan we see farther was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers ea also shared lavish profits with their developers which added to their industry appeal the square album cover boxes such as the covers for s mule and pinball construction set were a popular packaging concept by electronic arts which wanted to represent their developers as rock stars in the mids electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga a premier home computer of the late s and early s in europe commodore had given ea development tools and prototype machines before amigas actual launch for amiga ea published some notable nongame titles a drawing program deluxe paint  and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for amiga platform other amiga programs released by ea included deluxe music construction set deluxe paint animation and instant music some of them most notably deluxe paint were ported to other platforms for macintosh ea released a black  white animation tool called studio and a series of paint titles called studio and studio  in  ea published a flight simulator game exclusively for amiga fa interceptor which received attention due to its vector graphics that were notable for  standards another significant amiga release also initially available for atari st later converted for numerous other platforms was populous  developed by bullfrog productions it was a pioneering and influential title in the genre that was later called god games in  electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other consolegame publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now defunct do company in  electronic arts won the european computer trade show award for best software publisher of the year –edit headquarters of ea in october  ea is headquartered in the redwood shores neighborhood of redwood city california following the retirement and departure of trip hawkins in  ea decided to replace its logo with a new one and larry probst took over the reins in  ea made a multimilliondollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the university of southern californias interactive media division on february   electronic arts announced that it would cut worldwide staff by  percent on june   ea purchased mythic entertainment who are finished making warhammer online after segas espn nfl k successfully grabbed market share away from eas dominant madden nfl series during the  holiday season ea responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the nfl and in january  a year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april   ea announced a similar year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of eas success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platformagnostic development and the creation of strong multiyear franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises—madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc—with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in  that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property in september  nokia and ea announced a partnership in which ea becomes an exclusive major supplier of mobile games to nokia mobile devices through the nokia content discoverer in the beginning nokia customers were able to download seven ea titles tetris tetris mania the sims  doom fifa  tiger woods pga tour  and fifa street  on the holiday season in  rick simonson is the executive vice president and director of nokia and starting from  is affiliated with john riccitiello and are partners –edit in february  probst stepped down from the ceo job while remaining on the board of directors his handpicked successor is john riccitiello who had worked at ea for several years previously departed for a while and then returned riccitiello previously worked for elevation partners sara lee and pepsico in june  new ceo john riccitiello announced that ea would reorganize itself into four labels each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing the citystate model the goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decisionmaking increase creativity and quality and get games into the market faster this reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by ea of smaller studios which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of ea titles in  at the dice summit riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent riccitiello said that the citystate model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent and cited maxis and bioware as examples of studios thriving under the new structure also in  ea announced that it would be bringing some of its major titles to the macintosh ea has released battlefield  command  conquer tiberium wars crysis harry potter and the order of the phoenix madden nfl  need for speed carbon and spore for the mac all of the new games have been developed for the macintosh using cider a technology developed by transgaming that enables intelbased macs to run windows games inside a translation layer running on mac os x they are not playable on powerpcbased macs in october  ea purchased super computer international a longstanding industry provider of game server hosting for development studios who were currently developing the new playlinc software a week later they then purchased vg holding corp the parent company of bioware and pandemic studios it was revealed in february  that electronic arts had made a takeover bid for rival game company taketwo interactive after its initial offer of us per share all cash stock transaction offer was rejected by the taketwo board ea revised it to us per share a  premium over the previous days closing price and made the offer known to the public rumours had been floating around the internet prior to the offer about taketwo possibly being bought over by a bigger company albeit with viacom as the potential bidder in may  ea announced that it will purchase the assets of handson mobile korea a south korean mobile game developer and publisher the company will become ea mobile korea in september  ea dropped its buyout offer of taketwo no reason was given as of november   it was confirmed that electronic arts is closing their casual label  merging it with their hasbro partnership with the sims label ea also confirmed the departure of kathy vrabeck who was given the position as former president of the ea casual division in may  ea made this

acquisition and management practicesedit see also list of acquisitions by electronic arts during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example originproduced ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under eas ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early  ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture in  john d carmack of id software said that ea is no longer the evil empire ill admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studiosid have been surprised if you told me a year ago that wed end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them like other ea partners such as harmonixmtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isnt really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services—valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and were probably taking a third set ea was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after they released poorly performing games for instance origin though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet  was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted—countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of  percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisofts then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july  ea elected to sell its reduced  percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly € million us million treatment of employeesedit in  electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours—up to  hours per week—and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are  am to  pm—seven days a week—with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at  pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded us million as a result many of the lowerlevel developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by programmers was settled for us million since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address worklife balance concerns by focusing on longterm project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february  in december  an internal ea employee survey showed a  increase in employee morale and a  increase in perception of management recognition over a threeyear period in may  ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and ive been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact ive actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game qualityedit for  the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as  out of   points behind nintendo  but ahead of the other firstparty publishers microsoft  and sony  the closest thirdparty publisher is taketwo interactive publishing as k games and rockstar games at  the remaining top  publishers sega thq ubisoft activision square enix all rate in the mid s since  ea has published eight games that received universal acclaim in at least one platform metacritic score  or greater battlefield  crysis rock band fifa  fifa  mass effect  mass effect  and dragon age origins eas aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankingscom aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as  which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation visàvis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that eas innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snails pace while even the companys own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying were boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinseandrepeat theres been lots of product that looked like last years product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in  ea’s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic on december   ea was hit with a class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield  dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation  and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice responded by apologizing for the bugs and promising that they would halt all production of the release of new dlc packages until they fixed the various problems sports licensing and exclusivityedit on june   a lawsuit was filed in oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasnt on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee while ea argued the players likenesses was incidentally used this was rejected by the united states courts of appeals in  a further appeal to the us supreme court was unsuccessful in june  ea settled with jim brown for  on september   ea settled a series of wideranging class action lawsuits filed by former ncaa players accusing ea and others of unauthorized use of player likenesses in their football and basketball games ea settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount the settlement is reported to be around  million to be paid to between  and  players eula and drmedit in the september  release of eas game spore it was revealed that the drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machineactivation limit of three  instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazoncom with onestar ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of infringers to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was copied and distributed well before release on september   it was announced by torrentfreaks statistics that spore was the most torrented game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command  conquer red alert  would increase the installation limit to  rather than  on september   a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october   a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march   ea released a deauthorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to deauthorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june   ea announced a change in its approach to preventing copyright infringement of pc games while eliminating the drm that uniquely identifies a machine the plan described a replacement with a traditional cdkey check with an emphasis on downloaded content the plan moved toward software as a service in  ea received criticism regarding its persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity reboot advertisingedit in  ea arranged a fake protest outside the electronic entertainment expo to draw attention to the game dantes inferno ostensibly christian protestors bore placards objecting to the games themes involving hell and damnation and it was not clear until several days later that the event had been staged several christian bloggers criticized the event for perpetuating negative stereotypes about christians a  advertising campaign for dead space  featured older women reacting negatively to the game with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space  two hundred women had been selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games and their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in eas web and tv advertisements the campaign was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing outdated stereotypes against female and older gamers as of   of video game players were women and the average game player was  years old on february   the extra credits team at the time on the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dantes inferno medal of honor and dead space  releases they argue that eas decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a first amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry mass effect s ending was poorly received by both critics and fans due to the inconsistencies between statements by bioware staff during the games development and the form the endings ultimately took displeased by the ending one player took his complaint to the federal trade commission the agency created to protect consumers his argument was that bioware did not deliver on the promise of its game saying the end product did not match with the advertising campaign and pr interviews for the game the us better business bureau also responded to the controversy supporting claims by fans that bioware falsely advertised the players complete control over the games final outcome the uks advertising standards authority disagreed ruling that ea and bioware were not guilty of false advertisement since the endings were thematically quite different and the choices and readiness rating reflected in the ending content were significant enough to avoid actionable misleading of consumers under existing law according to a reddit administrator and a former moderator of the subreddit devoted to the  star wars battlefront moderators removed posts critical of the game at the direction of ea personnel in exchange for prerelease access to the game lgbt controversiesedit see also gender representation in video games § portrayal of lgbt characters ea has been noted for its inclusion of lgbt characters in games and was among the companies given a perfect lgbt workplace score by the human rights campaign in  the positive portrayals of lgbt characters in games by ea subsidiary bioware have motivated fan support and also backlash several employees involved in dragon age ii received hate mail and threats following its release bioware lead writer david gaider responded to a fan upset by the games bisexual romances denying the fans ability to speak for all straight male gamers and writing the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is if you ask me the one who deserves it least over the years from  through  various quotes both truly and falsely attributed to bioware writer jennifer hepler were circulated online by fans who considered her emblematic of their complaints after one quote from a  interview was used to link hepler with unpopular changes to dragon age iis combat systems hepler was harassed by telephone and online the issue tapped into longstanding discontent over games being simplified to appeal to broader audiences backlash was also related to heplers writing for anders the character that prompted the straight male gamer complaint according to susana polo in the mary sue heplers gender may have intensified the harassment she experienced but it was more directly the result of her being scapegoated for eas pivot towards casual gamers ea refused to abandon plans to add gay romances to star wars the old republic that were opposed by the family research council an online petition gathered more than  signatures in support of eas decision before the petition became compromised by automated spam signatures the automated signatures were discovered by reddit and chan users who accused ea of using the issue to link broader criticism of ea with homophobia when eventually added to the game the samesex romances were ridiculed for being confined to a single gay planet the consumerist rating as worst company in americaedit in april  the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the recordbreaking poll drew in more than  votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as att and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with  votes or  this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect  ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to eas win in the poll other explanations include use of dayone dlc and eas habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying were sure that bank presidents oil tobacco and weapons companies are all relieved they werent on the list this year were going to continue making awardwinning games and services played by more than  million people worldwide in april  ea won the consumerists poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect  for its ending dead space  for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity reboot due to its poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea’s business practices that so many people have — for the second year in a row — come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don’t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims  a singleplayer offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said dungeon keeper mobile app store vote manipulationedit in  ea released dungeon keeper mobile a freetoplay mobile variant of the popular s strategy game dungeon keeper the game was poorly received by both game critics and users critics noted that an ingame prompt claimed that star ratings from you help us provide free updates suggesting that the games creators would stop providing new content if players did not give the game sufficiently high ratings the rating system involved a redirect process to the mobile storefront on which the game was sold it was also pointed out that if players rated the game anything less than  stars the game would not redirect them and not actually cast their vote never indicating this to the user this led to accusations of ea fraudulently manipulating the games rating system and its subsequent score on mobile storefronts in june  electronic arts ceo andrew wilson made a public apology for the game stating that it was a shame that he regretted in july  the ukbased advertising standards authority banned a dungeon keeper mobile ad from broadcast stating that the advertisement deliberately misled consumers and made false statements about the games pricing and freetoplay nature later that same month frank gibeau head of eas mobile division stated that the games failure was attributed to audiences not being ready and that the game innovated too much these remarks resulted in backlash from game journalist media and users alike see

publishers on may   ea reported  billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending march  and on january   ea announced that it had exceeded  billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year in a note to employees ea ceo john riccitiello called this an incredibly important milestone for the company ea began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site pogocom in  in  ea acquired the londonbased social gaming startup playfish and in june  ea launched origin an online service to sell downloadable games directly to consumers there is also a on the house feature in origin that lets you download full versions of ea games for free it is updated regularly in july  ea announced that it had acquired popcap games the company behind hits such as plants vs zombies and bejeweled ea continued its shift toward digital goods in  folding its mobilefocused ea interactive eai division into other organizations throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale –  the beginningedit founder of ea trip hawkins in february  trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc where hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capitals spare office space to start the company on may   trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated us the company was not named amazin software but instead electronic arts seven months later in december  hawkins secured us million of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sevin rosen funds electronic arts original corporate logo – for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capitals office in august  during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october   by november employee headcount rose to  including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in  including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late  and helped the company sustain growth into us million in its third full yearcitation needed this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december  david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october  hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that the company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein  partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleepcitation needed hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordons suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film troncitation needed when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying were not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsedcitation needed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of eas trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with eas packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling ea routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous fullpage magazine ads their first such ad accompanied by the slogan we see farther was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers ea also shared lavish profits with their developers which added to their industry appeal the square album cover boxes such as the covers for s mule and pinball construction set were a popular packaging concept by electronic arts which wanted to represent their developers as rock stars in the mids electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga a premier home computer of the late s and early s in europe commodore had given ea development tools and prototype machines before amigas actual launch for amiga ea published some notable nongame titles a drawing program deluxe paint  and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for amiga platform other amiga programs released by ea included deluxe music construction set deluxe paint animation and instant music some of them most notably deluxe paint were ported to other platforms for macintosh ea released a black  white animation tool called studio and a series of paint titles called studio and studio  in  ea published a flight simulator game exclusively for amiga fa interceptor which received attention due to its vector graphics that were notable for  standards another significant amiga release also initially available for atari st later converted for numerous other platforms was populous  developed by bullfrog productions it was a pioneering and influential title in the genre that was later called god games in  electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other consolegame publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now defunct do company in  electronic arts won the european computer trade show award for best software publisher of the year –edit headquarters of ea in october  ea is headquartered in the redwood shores neighborhood of redwood city california following the retirement and departure of trip hawkins in  ea decided to replace its logo with a new one and larry probst took over the reins in  ea made a multimilliondollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the university of southern californias interactive media division on february   electronic arts announced that it would cut worldwide staff by  percent on june   ea purchased mythic entertainment who are finished making warhammer online after segas espn nfl k successfully grabbed market share away from eas dominant madden nfl series during the  holiday season ea responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the nfl and in january  a year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april   ea announced a similar year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of eas success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platformagnostic development and the creation of strong multiyear franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises—madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc—with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in  that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property in september  nokia and ea announced a partnership in

solitude microsoft windows playstation  xbox one controversiesedit studio acquisition and management practicesedit see also list of acquisitions by electronic arts during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example originproduced ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under eas ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early  ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture in  john d carmack of id software said that ea is no longer the evil empire ill admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studiosid have been surprised if you told me a year ago that wed end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them like other ea partners such as harmonixmtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isnt really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services—valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and were probably taking a third set ea was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after they released poorly performing games for instance origin though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet  was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted—countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of  percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisofts then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july  ea elected to sell its reduced  percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly € million us million treatment of employeesedit in  electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours—up to  hours per week—and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are  am to  pm—seven days a week—with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at  pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded us million as a result many of the lowerlevel developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by programmers was settled for us million since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address worklife balance concerns by focusing on longterm project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february  in december  an internal ea employee survey showed a  increase in employee morale and a  increase in perception of management recognition over a threeyear period in may  ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and ive been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact ive actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game qualityedit for  the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as  out of   points behind nintendo  but ahead of the other firstparty

effect  mass effect  and dragon age origins eas aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankingscom aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as  which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation visàvis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that eas innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snails pace while even the companys own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying were boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinseandrepeat theres been lots of product that looked like last years product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in  ea’s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic on december   ea was hit with a class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield  dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation  and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice responded by apologizing for the bugs and promising that they would halt all production of the release of new dlc packages until they fixed the various problems sports licensing and exclusivityedit on june   a lawsuit was filed in oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasnt on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee while ea argued the players likenesses was incidentally used this was rejected by the united states courts of appeals in  a further appeal to the us supreme court was unsuccessful in june  ea settled with jim brown for  on september   ea settled a series of wideranging class action lawsuits filed by former ncaa players accusing ea and others of unauthorized use of player likenesses in their football and basketball games ea settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount the settlement is reported to be around  million to be paid to between  and  players eula and drmedit in the september  release of eas game spore it was revealed that the drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machineactivation limit of three  instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazoncom with onestar ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of infringers to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was copied and distributed well before release on september   it was announced by torrentfreaks statistics that spore was the most torrented game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command  conquer red alert  would increase the installation limit to  rather than  on september   a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october   a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march   ea released a deauthorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to deauthorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june   ea announced a change in its approach to preventing copyright infringement of pc games while eliminating the drm that uniquely identifies a machine the plan described a replacement with a traditional cdkey check with an emphasis on downloaded content the plan moved toward software as a service in  ea received criticism regarding its persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity reboot advertisingedit in  ea arranged a fake protest outside the electronic entertainment expo to draw attention to the game dantes inferno ostensibly christian protestors bore placards objecting to the games themes involving hell and damnation and it was not clear until several days later that the event had been staged several christian bloggers criticized the event for perpetuating negative stereotypes about christians a  advertising campaign for dead space  featured older women reacting negatively to the game with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space  two hundred women had been selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games and their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in eas web and tv advertisements the campaign was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing outdated stereotypes against female and older gamers as of   of video game players were women and the average game player was  years old on february   the extra credits team at the time on the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dantes inferno medal of honor and dead space  releases they argue that eas decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a first amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry mass effect s ending was poorly received by both critics and fans due to the inconsistencies between statements by bioware staff during the games development and the form the endings ultimately took displeased by the ending one player took his complaint to the federal trade commission the agency created to protect consumers his argument was that bioware did not deliver on the promise of its game saying the end product did not match with the advertising campaign and pr interviews for the game the us better business bureau also responded to the controversy supporting claims by fans that bioware falsely advertised the players complete control over the games final outcome the uks advertising standards authority disagreed ruling that ea and bioware were not guilty of false advertisement since the endings were thematically quite different and the choices and readiness rating reflected in the ending content were significant enough to avoid actionable misleading of consumers under existing law according to a reddit administrator and a former moderator of the subreddit devoted to the  star wars battlefront moderators removed posts critical of the game at the direction of ea personnel in exchange for prerelease access to the game lgbt controversiesedit see also gender representation in video games § portrayal of lgbt characters ea has been noted for its inclusion of lgbt characters in games and was among the companies given a perfect lgbt workplace score by the human rights campaign in  the positive portrayals of lgbt characters in games by ea subsidiary bioware have motivated fan support and also backlash several employees involved in dragon age ii received hate mail and threats following its release bioware lead writer david gaider responded to a fan upset by the games bisexual romances denying the fans ability to speak for all straight male gamers and writing the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is if you ask me the one who deserves it least over the years from  through  various quotes both truly and falsely attributed to bioware writer jennifer hepler were circulated online by fans who considered her emblematic of their complaints after one quote from a  interview was used to link hepler with unpopular changes to dragon age iis combat systems hepler was harassed by telephone and online the issue tapped into longstanding discontent over games being simplified to appeal to broader audiences backlash was also related to heplers writing for anders the character that prompted the straight male gamer complaint according to susana polo in the mary sue heplers gender may have intensified the harassment she experienced but it was more directly the result of her being scapegoated for eas pivot towards casual gamers ea refused to abandon plans to add gay romances to star wars the old republic that were opposed by the family research council an online petition gathered more than  signatures in support of eas decision before the petition became compromised by automated spam signatures the automated signatures were discovered by reddit and chan users who accused ea of using the issue to link broader criticism of ea with homophobia when eventually added to the game the samesex romances were ridiculed for being confined to a single gay planet the consumerist rating as worst company in americaedit in april  the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the recordbreaking poll drew in more than  votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as att and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with  votes or  this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect  ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to eas win in the poll other explanations include use of dayone dlc and eas habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying were sure that bank presidents oil tobacco and weapons companies are all relieved they werent on the list this year were going to continue making awardwinning games and services played by more than  million people worldwide in april  ea won the consumerists poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect  for its ending dead space  for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity reboot due to its poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea’s business practices that so many people have — for the second year in a row — come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don’t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims  a singleplayer offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said dungeon keeper mobile app store vote manipulationedit in  ea released dungeon keeper mobile a freetoplay mobile variant of the popular s strategy game dungeon keeper the game was poorly received by both game critics and users critics noted that an ingame prompt claimed that star ratings from you help us provide free updates suggesting that the games creators would stop providing new content if players did not give the game sufficiently high ratings the rating system involved a redirect process to the mobile storefront on which the game was sold it was also pointed out that if players rated the game anything less than  stars the game would not redirect them and not actually cast their vote never indicating this to the user this led to accusations of ea fraudulently manipulating the games rating system and its subsequent score on mobile storefronts in june  electronic arts ceo andrew wilson made a public apology for the game stating that it was a shame that he regretted in july  the ukbased advertising standards authority banned a dungeon keeper mobile ad from broadcast stating that the advertisement deliberately misled consumers and made false statements about the games pricing and freetoplay nature later that same month frank gibeau head of eas mobile division stated that the games failure was attributed to audiences not being ready and that the game innovated too much these remarks

publishers on may   ea reported  billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending march  and on january   ea announced that it had exceeded  billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year in a note to employees ea ceo john riccitiello called this an incredibly important milestone for the company ea began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site pogocom in  in  ea acquired the londonbased social gaming startup playfish and in june  ea launched origin an online service to sell downloadable games directly to consumers there is also a on the house feature in origin that lets you download full versions of ea games for free it is updated regularly in july  ea announced that it had acquired popcap

throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale –  the beginningedit founder of ea trip hawkins in february  trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc where hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capitals spare office space to start the company on may   trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated us the company was not named amazin software but instead electronic arts seven months later in december  hawkins secured us million of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sevin rosen funds electronic arts original corporate logo – for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capitals office in august  during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october   by november employee headcount rose to  including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in  including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late  and helped the company sustain growth into us million in its third full yearcitation needed this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december  david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october  hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that the company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein  partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleepcitation needed hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordons suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film troncitation needed when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying were not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsedcitation needed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of eas trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with eas packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling ea routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous fullpage magazine ads their first such ad accompanied by the slogan we see farther

solitude microsoft windows playstation  xbox one controversiesedit studio acquisition and management practicesedit see also list of acquisitions by electronic arts during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example originproduced ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under eas ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early  ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture in  john d carmack of id software said that ea is no longer the evil empire ill admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studiosid have been surprised if you told me a year ago that wed end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them like other ea partners such as harmonixmtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isnt really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services—valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and were probably taking a third set ea was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after they released poorly performing games for instance origin though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet  was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted—countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of  percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisofts then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july  ea elected to sell its reduced  percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly € million us million treatment of employeesedit in  electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours—up to  hours per week—and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are  am to  pm—seven days a week—with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at  pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded us million as a result many of the lowerlevel developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by programmers was settled for us million since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address worklife balance concerns by focusing on longterm project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february  in december  an internal ea employee survey showed a  increase in employee morale and a  increase in perception of management recognition over a threeyear period in may  ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and ive been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact ive actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game qualityedit for  the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as  out of   points behind nintendo  but ahead of the other firstparty

effect  mass effect  and dragon age origins eas aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankingscom aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as  which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation visàvis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that eas innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snails pace while even the companys own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying were boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinseandrepeat theres been lots of product that looked like last years product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in  ea’s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic on december   ea was hit with a class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield  dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation  and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice responded by apologizing for the bugs and promising that they would halt all production of the release of new dlc packages until they fixed the various problems sports licensing and exclusivityedit on june   a lawsuit was filed in oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasnt on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee while ea argued the players likenesses was incidentally used this was rejected by the united states courts of appeals in  a further appeal to the us supreme court was unsuccessful in june  ea settled with jim brown for  on september   ea settled a series of wideranging class action lawsuits filed by former ncaa players accusing ea and others of unauthorized use of player likenesses in their football and basketball games ea settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount the settlement is reported to be around  million to be paid to between  and  players eula and drmedit in the september  release of eas game spore it was revealed that the drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machineactivation limit of three  instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazoncom with onestar ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of infringers to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was copied and distributed well before release on september   it was announced by torrentfreaks statistics that spore was the most torrented game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command  conquer red alert  would increase the installation limit to  rather than  on september   a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october   a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march   ea released a deauthorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to deauthorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june   ea announced a change in its approach to preventing copyright infringement of pc games while eliminating the drm that uniquely identifies a machine the plan described a replacement with a traditional cdkey check with an emphasis on downloaded content the plan moved toward software as a service in  ea received criticism regarding its persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity reboot advertisingedit in  ea arranged a fake protest outside the electronic entertainment expo to draw attention to the game dantes inferno ostensibly christian protestors bore placards objecting to the games themes involving hell and damnation and it was not clear until several days later that the event had been staged several christian bloggers criticized the event for perpetuating negative stereotypes about christians a  advertising campaign for dead space  featured older women reacting negatively to the game with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space  two hundred women had been selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games and their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in eas web and tv advertisements the campaign was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing outdated stereotypes against female and older gamers as of   of video game players were women and the average game player was  years old on february   the extra credits team at the time on the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dantes inferno medal of honor and dead space  releases they argue that eas decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a first amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry mass effect s ending was poorly received by both critics and fans due to the inconsistencies between statements by bioware staff during the games development and the form the endings ultimately took displeased by the ending one player took his complaint to the federal trade commission the agency created to protect consumers his argument was that bioware did not deliver on the promise of its game saying the end product did not match with the advertising campaign and pr interviews for the game the us better business bureau also responded to the controversy supporting claims by fans that bioware falsely advertised the players complete control over the games final outcome the uks advertising standards authority disagreed ruling that ea and bioware were not guilty of false advertisement since the endings were thematically quite different and the choices and readiness rating reflected in the ending content were significant enough to avoid actionable misleading of consumers under existing law according to a reddit administrator and a former moderator of the subreddit devoted to the  star wars battlefront moderators removed posts critical of the game at the direction of ea personnel in exchange for prerelease access to the game lgbt controversiesedit see also gender representation in video games § portrayal of lgbt characters ea has been noted for its inclusion of lgbt characters in games and was among the companies given a perfect lgbt workplace score by the human rights campaign in  the positive portrayals of lgbt characters in games by ea subsidiary bioware have motivated fan support and also backlash several employees involved in dragon age ii received hate mail and threats following its release bioware lead writer david gaider responded to a fan upset by the games bisexual romances denying the fans ability to speak for all straight male gamers and writing the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is if you ask me the one who deserves it least over the years from  through  various quotes both truly and falsely attributed to bioware writer jennifer hepler were circulated online by fans who considered her emblematic of their complaints after one quote from a  interview was used to link hepler with unpopular changes to dragon age iis combat systems hepler was harassed by telephone and online the issue tapped into longstanding discontent over games being simplified to appeal to broader audiences backlash was also related to heplers writing for anders the character that prompted the straight male gamer complaint according to susana polo in the mary sue heplers gender may have intensified the harassment she experienced but it was more directly the result of her being scapegoated for eas pivot towards casual gamers ea refused to abandon plans to add gay romances to star wars the old republic that were opposed by the family research council an online petition gathered more than  signatures in support of eas decision before the petition became compromised by automated spam signatures the automated signatures were discovered by reddit and chan users who accused ea of using the issue to link broader criticism of ea with homophobia when eventually added to the game the samesex romances were ridiculed for being confined to a single gay planet the consumerist rating as worst company in americaedit in april  the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the recordbreaking poll drew in more than  votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as att and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with  votes or  this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect  ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to eas win in the poll other explanations include use of dayone dlc and eas habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying were sure that bank presidents oil tobacco and weapons companies are all relieved they werent on the list this year were going to continue making awardwinning games and services played by more than  million people worldwide in april  ea won the consumerists poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect  for its ending dead space  for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity reboot due to its poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea’s business practices that so many people have — for the second year in a row — come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don’t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims  a singleplayer offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said dungeon keeper mobile app store vote manipulationedit in  ea released dungeon keeper mobile a freetoplay mobile variant of the popular s strategy game dungeon keeper the game was poorly received by both game critics and users critics noted that an ingame prompt claimed that star ratings from you help us provide free updates suggesting that the games creators would stop providing new content if players did not give the game sufficiently high ratings the rating system involved a redirect process to the mobile storefront on which the game was sold it was also pointed out that if players rated the game anything less than  stars the game would not redirect them and not actually cast their vote never indicating this to the user this led to accusations of ea fraudulently manipulating the games rating system and its subsequent score on mobile storefronts in june  electronic arts ceo andrew wilson made a public apology for the game stating that it was a shame that he regretted in july  the ukbased advertising standards authority banned a dungeon keeper mobile ad from broadcast stating that the advertisement deliberately misled consumers and made false statements about the games pricing and freetoplay

and on january   ea announced that it had exceeded  billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year in a note to employees ea ceo john riccitiello called this an incredibly important milestone for the company ea began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site pogocom in  in  ea acquired the londonbased

shift toward digital goods in  folding its mobilefocused ea interactive eai division into other organizations throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale –  the beginningedit founder of ea trip hawkins in february  trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc where hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capitals spare office space to start the company on may   trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated us the company was not named amazin software but instead electronic arts seven months later in december  hawkins secured us million of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sevin rosen funds electronic arts original corporate logo – for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capitals office in august  during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october   by november employee headcount rose to  including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in  including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late  and helped the company sustain growth into us million in its third full yearcitation needed this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december  david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october  hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that the company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein  partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleepcitation needed hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordons suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film troncitation needed when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying were not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsedcitation needed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of eas trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with eas packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling ea routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous fullpage magazine ads their first such ad accompanied by the slogan we see farther was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers ea also shared lavish profits with their developers which added to their industry appeal the square album cover boxes such as the covers for s mule and pinball construction set were a popular packaging concept by electronic arts which wanted to represent their developers as rock stars in the mids electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga a premier home computer of the late s and early s in europe commodore had given ea development tools and prototype machines before amigas actual launch for amiga ea published some notable nongame titles a drawing program deluxe paint  and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for amiga platform other amiga programs released by ea included deluxe music construction set deluxe paint animation and instant music some of them most notably deluxe paint were ported to other platforms for macintosh ea released a black  white animation tool called studio and a series of paint titles called studio and studio  in  ea published a flight simulator game exclusively for amiga fa interceptor which received attention due to its vector graphics that were notable for  standards another significant amiga release also initially available for atari st later converted for numerous other platforms was populous  developed by bullfrog productions it was a pioneering and influential title in the genre that was later called god games in  electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other consolegame publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now defunct do company in  electronic arts won the european computer trade show award for best software publisher of the year –edit headquarters of ea in october  ea is headquartered in the redwood shores neighborhood of redwood city california following the retirement and departure of trip hawkins in  ea decided to replace its logo with a new one and larry probst took over the reins in  ea made a multimilliondollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the university of southern californias interactive media division on february   electronic arts announced that it would cut worldwide staff by  percent on june   ea purchased mythic entertainment who are finished making warhammer online after segas espn nfl k successfully grabbed market share away from eas dominant madden nfl series during the  holiday season ea responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the nfl and in january  a year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april   ea announced a similar year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of eas success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platformagnostic development and the creation of strong multiyear franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises—madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc—with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in  that it would concentrate more of its effort on

for elevation partners sara lee and pepsico in june  new ceo john riccitiello announced that ea would reorganize itself into four labels each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing the citystate model the goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decisionmaking increase creativity and quality and get games into the market faster this reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by ea of smaller studios which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of ea titles in  at the dice summit riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent riccitiello said that the citystate model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent and cited maxis and bioware as examples of studios thriving under the new structure also in  ea announced that it would be bringing some of its major

acquisition and management practicesedit see also list of acquisitions by electronic arts during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example originproduced ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under eas ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early  ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture in  john d carmack of id software said that ea is no longer the evil empire ill admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studiosid have been surprised if you told me a year ago that wed end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them like other ea partners such as harmonixmtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isnt really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services—valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and were probably taking a third set ea was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after they released poorly performing games for instance origin though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet  was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted—countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of  percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisofts then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july  ea elected to sell its reduced  percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly € million us million treatment of employeesedit in  electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours—up to  hours per week—and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are  am to  pm—seven days a week—with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at  pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded us million as a result many of the lowerlevel developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by programmers was settled for us million since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address worklife balance concerns by focusing on longterm project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february  in december  an internal ea employee survey showed a  increase in employee morale and a  increase in perception of management recognition over a threeyear period in may  ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and ive been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact ive actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game qualityedit for  the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as  out of   points behind nintendo  but ahead of the other firstparty publishers microsoft  and sony  the closest thirdparty publisher is taketwo interactive publishing as k games and rockstar games at  the remaining top  publishers sega thq ubisoft activision square enix all rate in the mid s since  ea has published eight games that received universal acclaim in at least one platform metacritic score  or greater battlefield  crysis rock band fifa  fifa  mass effect  mass effect  and dragon age origins eas aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankingscom aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as  which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation visàvis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that eas innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snails pace while even the companys own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying were boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinseandrepeat theres been lots of product that looked like last years product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in  ea’s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic on december   ea was hit with a class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield  dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation  and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice responded by apologizing for the bugs and promising that they would halt all production of the release of new dlc packages until they fixed the various problems sports licensing and exclusivityedit on june   a lawsuit was filed in oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasnt on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee while ea argued the players likenesses was incidentally used this was rejected by the united states courts of appeals in  a further appeal to the us supreme court was unsuccessful in june  ea settled with jim brown for  on september   ea settled a series of wideranging class action lawsuits filed by former ncaa players accusing ea and others of unauthorized use of player likenesses in their football and basketball games ea settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount the settlement is reported to be around  million to be paid to between  and  players eula and drmedit in the september  release of eas game spore it was revealed that the drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machineactivation limit of three  instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazoncom with onestar ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of infringers to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was copied and distributed well before release on september   it was announced by torrentfreaks statistics that spore was the most torrented game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command  conquer red alert  would increase the installation limit to  rather than  on september   a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october   a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march   ea released a deauthorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to deauthorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june   ea announced a change in its approach to preventing copyright infringement of pc games while eliminating the drm that uniquely identifies a machine the plan described a replacement with a traditional cdkey check with an emphasis on downloaded content the plan moved toward software as a service in  ea received criticism regarding its persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity reboot advertisingedit in  ea arranged a fake protest outside the electronic entertainment expo to draw attention to the game dantes inferno ostensibly christian protestors bore placards objecting to the games themes involving hell and damnation and it was not clear until several days later that the event had been staged several christian bloggers criticized the event for perpetuating negative stereotypes about christians a  advertising campaign for dead space  featured older women reacting negatively to the game with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space  two hundred women had been selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games and their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in eas web and tv advertisements the campaign was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing outdated stereotypes against female and older gamers as of   of video game players were women and the average game player was  years old on february   the extra credits team at the time on the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dantes inferno medal of honor and dead space  releases they argue that eas decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a first amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry mass effect s ending was poorly received by both critics and fans due to the inconsistencies between statements by bioware staff during the games development and the form the endings ultimately took displeased by the ending one player took his complaint to the federal trade commission the agency created to protect consumers his argument was that bioware did not deliver on the promise of its game saying the end product did not match with the advertising campaign and pr interviews for the game the us better business bureau also responded to the controversy supporting claims by fans that bioware falsely advertised the players complete control over the games final outcome the uks advertising standards authority disagreed ruling that ea and bioware were not guilty of false advertisement since the endings were thematically quite different and the choices and readiness rating reflected in the ending content were significant enough to avoid actionable misleading of consumers under existing law according to a reddit administrator and a former moderator of the subreddit devoted to the  star wars battlefront moderators removed posts critical of the game at the direction of ea personnel in exchange for prerelease access to the game lgbt controversiesedit see also gender representation in video games § portrayal of lgbt characters ea has been noted for its inclusion of lgbt characters in games and was among the companies given a perfect lgbt workplace score by the human rights campaign in  the positive portrayals of lgbt characters in games by ea subsidiary bioware have motivated fan support and also backlash several employees involved in dragon age ii received hate mail and threats following its release bioware lead writer david gaider responded to a fan upset by the games bisexual romances denying the fans ability to speak for all straight male gamers and writing the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is if you ask me the one who deserves it least over the years from  through  various quotes both truly and falsely attributed to bioware writer jennifer hepler were circulated online by fans who considered her emblematic of their complaints after one quote from a  interview was used to link hepler with unpopular changes to dragon age iis combat systems hepler was harassed by telephone and online the issue tapped into longstanding discontent over games being simplified to appeal to broader audiences backlash was also related to heplers writing for anders the character that prompted the straight male gamer complaint according to susana polo in the mary sue heplers gender may have intensified the harassment she experienced but it was more directly the result of her being scapegoated for eas pivot towards casual gamers ea refused to abandon plans to add gay romances to star wars the old republic that were opposed by the family research council an online petition gathered more than  signatures in support of eas decision before the petition became compromised by automated spam signatures the automated signatures were discovered by reddit and chan users who accused ea of using the issue to link broader criticism of ea with homophobia when eventually added to the game the samesex romances were ridiculed for being confined to a single gay planet the consumerist rating as worst company in americaedit in april  the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the recordbreaking poll drew in more than  votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as att and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with  votes or  this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect  ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to eas win in the poll other explanations include use of dayone dlc and eas habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying were sure that bank presidents oil tobacco and weapons companies are all relieved they werent on the list this year were going to continue making awardwinning games and services played by more than  million people worldwide in april  ea won the consumerists poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect  for its ending dead space  for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity reboot due to its poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea’s business practices that so many people have — for the second year in a row — come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don’t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims  a singleplayer offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said dungeon keeper mobile app store vote manipulationedit in  ea released dungeon keeper mobile a freetoplay mobile variant of the popular s strategy game dungeon keeper the game was poorly received by both game critics and users critics noted that an ingame prompt claimed that star ratings from you help us provide free updates suggesting that the games creators would stop providing new content if players did not give the game sufficiently high ratings the rating system involved a redirect process to the mobile storefront on which the game was sold it was also pointed out that if players rated the game anything less than  stars the game would not redirect them and not actually cast their vote never indicating this to the user this led to accusations of ea fraudulently manipulating the games rating system and its subsequent score on mobile storefronts in june  electronic arts ceo andrew wilson made a public apology for the game stating that it was a shame that he regretted in july  the ukbased advertising standards authority banned a dungeon keeper mobile ad from broadcast stating that the advertisement deliberately misled consumers and made false statements about the games pricing and freetoplay nature later that same month frank gibeau head of eas mobile division stated that the games failure was attributed to audiences not being ready and that the game innovated too much these remarks resulted in backlash from game journalist media and users alike see

publishers on may   ea reported  billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending march  and on january   ea announced that it had exceeded  billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year in a note to employees ea ceo john riccitiello called this an incredibly important milestone for the company ea began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site pogocom in  in  ea acquired the londonbased social gaming startup playfish and in june  ea launched origin an online service to sell downloadable games

games the company behind hits such as plants vs zombies and bejeweled ea continued its shift toward digital goods in  folding its mobilefocused ea interactive eai division into other organizations throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale –  the beginningedit founder of ea trip hawkins in february  trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc where hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capitals spare office space to start the company on may   trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated us the company was not named amazin software but instead electronic arts seven months later in december  hawkins secured us million of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sevin rosen funds electronic arts original corporate logo – for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capitals office in august  during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october   by november employee headcount rose to  including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in  including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late  and helped the company sustain growth into us million in its third full yearcitation needed this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december  david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october  hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that the company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein  partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleepcitation needed hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordons suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film troncitation needed when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying were not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsedcitation needed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of eas trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with eas packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling ea routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous fullpage magazine ads their first such ad accompanied by the slogan we see farther was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers ea also shared lavish profits with their developers which added to their industry appeal the square album cover boxes such as the covers for s mule and pinball construction set were a popular packaging concept by electronic arts which wanted to represent their developers as rock stars in the mids electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga a premier home computer of the late s and early s in europe commodore had given ea development tools and prototype machines before amigas actual launch for amiga ea published some notable nongame titles a drawing program deluxe paint  and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for amiga platform other amiga programs released by ea included deluxe music construction set deluxe paint animation and instant music some of them most notably deluxe paint were ported to other platforms for macintosh ea released a black  white animation tool called studio and a series of paint titles called studio and studio  in  ea published a flight simulator game exclusively for amiga fa interceptor which received attention due to its vector graphics that were notable for  standards another significant amiga release also initially available for atari st later converted for numerous other platforms was populous  developed by bullfrog productions it was a pioneering and influential title in the genre that was later called god games in  electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other consolegame publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now defunct do company in  electronic arts won the european computer trade show award for best software publisher of the year –edit headquarters of ea in october  ea is headquartered in the redwood shores neighborhood of redwood city california following the retirement and departure of trip hawkins in  ea decided to replace its logo with a new one and larry probst took over the reins in  ea made a multimilliondollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the university of southern californias interactive media division on february   electronic arts announced that it would cut worldwide staff by  percent on june   ea purchased mythic entertainment who are finished making warhammer online after segas espn nfl k successfully grabbed market share away from eas dominant madden nfl series during the  holiday season ea responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the nfl and in january  a year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april   ea announced a similar year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of eas success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platformagnostic development and the creation of strong multiyear franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises—madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc—with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in  that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property in september  nokia and ea announced a partnership in

ea for several years previously departed for a while and then returned riccitiello previously worked for elevation partners sara lee and pepsico in june  new ceo john riccitiello announced that ea would reorganize itself into four labels each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing the citystate model the goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decisionmaking increase creativity and quality and get games into the market faster this reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by ea of smaller studios which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of ea titles in  at the dice summit riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent riccitiello said that the citystate model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent and cited maxis and bioware as examples of studios thriving under the new structure also in  ea announced that it would be bringing some of its major titles to the macintosh ea has released battlefield  command  conquer tiberium wars crysis harry

product design marketing and demographics  in the days and weeks ahead we will make further announcements on the reporting structure for the other businesses in the casual label including ea mobile

solitude microsoft windows playstation  xbox one controversiesedit studio acquisition and management practicesedit see also list of acquisitions by electronic arts during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example originproduced ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under eas ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early  ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture in  john d carmack of id software said that ea is no longer the evil empire ill admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studiosid have been surprised if you told me a year ago that wed end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them like other ea partners such as harmonixmtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isnt really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services—valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and were probably taking a third set ea was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after they released poorly performing games for instance origin though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet  was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted—countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of  percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisofts then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july  ea elected to sell its reduced  percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly € million us million treatment of employeesedit in  electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours—up to  hours per week—and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are  am to  pm—seven days a week—with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at  pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded us million as a result many of the lowerlevel developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by programmers was settled for us million since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address worklife balance concerns by focusing on longterm project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february  in december  an internal ea employee survey showed a  increase in employee morale and a  increase in perception of management recognition over a threeyear period in may  ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and ive been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact ive actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game qualityedit for  the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as  out of   points behind nintendo  but ahead of the other firstparty publishers microsoft  and sony  the closest thirdparty publisher is taketwo interactive publishing as k games and rockstar games at  the remaining top  publishers sega thq ubisoft activision square enix all rate in the mid s since  ea has published eight games that received universal acclaim in at least one platform metacritic score  or greater battlefield  crysis rock band fifa  fifa  mass effect  mass effect  and dragon age origins eas aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankingscom aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as  which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation visàvis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that eas innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snails pace while even the companys own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying were boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinseandrepeat theres been lots of product that looked like last years product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in  ea’s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic on december   ea was hit with a class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield  dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation  and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice responded by apologizing for the bugs and promising that they would halt all production of the release of new dlc packages until they fixed the various problems sports licensing and exclusivityedit on june   a lawsuit was filed in oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasnt on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee while ea argued the players likenesses was incidentally used this was rejected by the united states courts of appeals in  a further appeal to the us supreme court was unsuccessful in june  ea settled with jim brown for  on september   ea settled a series of wideranging class action lawsuits filed by former ncaa players accusing ea and others of unauthorized use of player likenesses in their football and basketball games ea settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount the settlement is reported to be around  million to be paid to between  and  players eula and drmedit in the september  release of eas game spore it was revealed that the drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machineactivation limit of three  instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazoncom with onestar ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of infringers to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was copied and distributed well before release on september   it was announced by torrentfreaks statistics that spore was the most torrented game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command  conquer red alert  would increase the installation limit to  rather than  on september   a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october   a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march   ea released a deauthorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to deauthorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june   ea announced a change in its approach to preventing copyright infringement of pc games while eliminating the drm that uniquely identifies a machine the plan described a replacement with a traditional cdkey check with an emphasis on downloaded content the plan moved toward software as a service in  ea received criticism regarding its persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity reboot advertisingedit in  ea arranged a fake protest outside the electronic entertainment expo to draw attention to the game dantes inferno ostensibly christian protestors bore placards objecting to the games themes involving hell and damnation and it was not clear until several days later that the event had been staged several christian bloggers criticized the event for perpetuating negative stereotypes about christians a  advertising campaign for dead space  featured older women reacting negatively to the game with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space  two hundred women had been selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games and their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in eas web and tv advertisements the campaign was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing outdated stereotypes against female and older gamers as of   of video game players were women and the average game player was  years old on february   the extra credits team at the time on the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dantes inferno medal of honor and dead space  releases they argue that eas decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a first amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry mass effect s ending was poorly received by both critics and fans due to the inconsistencies between statements by bioware staff during the games development and the form the endings ultimately took displeased by the ending one player took his complaint to the federal trade commission the agency created to protect consumers his argument was that bioware did not deliver on the promise of its game saying the end product did not match with the advertising campaign and pr interviews for the game the us better business bureau also responded to the controversy supporting claims by fans that bioware falsely advertised the players complete control over the games final outcome the uks advertising standards authority disagreed ruling that ea and bioware were not guilty of false advertisement since the endings were thematically quite different and the choices and readiness rating reflected in the ending content were significant enough to avoid actionable misleading of consumers under existing law according to a reddit administrator and a former moderator of the subreddit devoted to the  star wars battlefront moderators removed posts critical of the game at the direction of ea personnel in exchange for prerelease access to the game lgbt controversiesedit see also gender representation in video games § portrayal of lgbt characters ea has been noted for its inclusion of lgbt characters in games and was among the companies given a perfect lgbt workplace score by the human rights campaign in  the positive portrayals of lgbt characters in games by ea subsidiary bioware have motivated fan support and also backlash several employees involved in dragon age ii received hate mail and threats following its release bioware lead writer david gaider responded to a fan upset by the games bisexual romances denying the fans ability to speak for all straight male gamers and writing the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is if you ask me the one who deserves it least over the years from  through  various quotes both truly and falsely attributed to bioware writer jennifer hepler were circulated online by fans who considered her emblematic of their complaints after one quote from a  interview was used to link hepler with unpopular changes to dragon age iis combat systems hepler was harassed by telephone and online the issue tapped into longstanding discontent over games being simplified to appeal to broader audiences backlash was also related to heplers writing for anders the character that prompted the straight male gamer complaint according to susana polo in the mary sue heplers gender may have intensified the harassment she experienced but it was more directly the result of her being scapegoated for eas pivot towards casual gamers ea refused to abandon plans to add gay romances to star wars the old republic that were opposed by the family research council an online petition gathered more than  signatures in support of eas decision before the petition became compromised by automated spam signatures the automated signatures were discovered by reddit and chan users who accused ea of using the issue to link broader criticism of ea with homophobia when eventually added to the game the samesex romances were ridiculed for being confined to a single gay planet the consumerist rating as worst company in americaedit in april  the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the recordbreaking poll drew in more than  votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as att and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with  votes or  this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect  ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to eas win in the poll other explanations include use of dayone dlc and eas habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying were sure that bank presidents oil tobacco and weapons companies are all relieved they werent on the list this year were going to continue making awardwinning games and services played by more than  million people worldwide in april  ea won the consumerists poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect  for its ending dead space  for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity reboot due to its poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea’s business practices that so many people have — for the second year in a row — come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don’t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims  a singleplayer offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said dungeon keeper mobile app store vote manipulationedit in  ea released dungeon keeper mobile a freetoplay mobile variant of the popular s strategy game dungeon keeper the game was poorly received by both game critics and users critics noted that an ingame prompt claimed that star ratings from you help us provide free updates suggesting that the games creators would stop providing new content if players did not give the game sufficiently high ratings the rating system involved a redirect process to the mobile storefront on which the game was sold it was also pointed out that if players rated the game anything less than  stars the game would not redirect them and not actually cast their vote never indicating this to the user this led to accusations of ea fraudulently manipulating the games rating system and its subsequent score on mobile storefronts in june  electronic arts ceo andrew wilson made a public apology for the game stating that it was a shame that he regretted in july  the ukbased advertising standards authority banned a dungeon keeper mobile ad from broadcast stating that the advertisement deliberately misled consumers and made false statements about the games pricing and freetoplay nature later that same month frank gibeau head of eas mobile division stated that the games failure was attributed to audiences not being ready and that the game innovated too much these remarks

times times times times media money with julia boorstin electronic arts radical strategy for longterm growth julia boorstin  jboorstin wednesday  aug    pm etcnbccom shares brent lewin  bloomberg  getty images electronic arts inc ea signage is displayed outside of the companys office in vancouver british columbia canada electronic arts which reported slightly betterthanexpected earnings tuesday is radically shifting its strategy for “star wars the old republic” as a part of its big bet on free and digital gaming the company announced it will now give it away for nothing “the idea of giving away play for free is the trend seeing that we’re in the market place” electronic arts coo peter moore told cnbc wednesday “this premium trend — bringing more and more people in to play games knocking down the barrier in price — is an important part of our growth strategy” the company is hoping this strategy will convert some of those players to a premium subscription model andor get them to pay for upgrades with ingame currency as one of electronic arts biggest investments “star wars the old republic” continued to bleed subscribers losing another  to end the quarter with fewer than one million and leaving wall street disappointed show chapters ea posts lower q earnings    wednesday  aug    am et “if we can get two to three million people playing the game you then start to transition from getting your money upfront if you will by selling the game to an arpu — average revenue per user model” moore said “that is the longterm growth plan and we are very optimistic that will work” electronic arts didn’t launch a single packaged goods game in the most recent quarter— two thirds of the game company’s revenue was from digital offerings the company reported slightly better than expected earnings — a loss of  cents per share — and announced a  million share repurchase but the real headline was the company’s ongoing investment in all sorts of digital games—mobile social online and digital downloads and downloadable content however zynga’s disappointing results call into question the future of social gaming raising major concerns about slowing growth moore noted that ea still sees social games as a growing profitable sector even if growth is slowing he also made a point of distinguishing ea’s strategy from zynga’s “we are investing in brands in social and i think that’s the difference … we are a lot more diversified and we have the portfolio brand that consumers recognize around the world” he concluded by cnbcs julia boorstinjboorstin questions comments

in a note to employees ea ceo john riccitiello called this an incredibly important milestone for the company ea began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site pogocom in  in  ea acquired the londonbased social gaming startup playfish and in june  ea launched origin an online service to sell downloadable games

games the company behind hits such as plants vs zombies and bejeweled ea continued its shift toward digital goods in  folding its mobilefocused ea interactive eai division into other organizations throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale –  the beginningedit founder of ea trip hawkins in february  trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc where hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capitals spare office space to start the company on may   trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated us the company was not named amazin software but instead electronic arts seven months later in december  hawkins secured us million of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sevin rosen funds electronic arts original corporate logo – for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capitals office in august  during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october   by november employee headcount rose to  including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in  including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late  and helped the company sustain growth into us million in its third full yearcitation needed this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december  david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october  hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that the company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein  partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleepcitation needed hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordons suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film troncitation needed when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying were not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsedcitation needed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of eas trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with eas packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling ea routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous fullpage magazine ads their first such ad accompanied by the slogan we see farther was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers ea also shared lavish profits with their developers which added to their industry appeal the square album cover boxes such as the covers for s mule and pinball construction set were a popular packaging concept by electronic arts which wanted to represent their developers as rock stars in the mids electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga a premier home computer of the late s and early s in europe commodore had given ea development tools and prototype machines before amigas actual launch for amiga ea published some notable nongame titles a drawing program deluxe paint  and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for amiga platform other amiga programs released by ea included deluxe music construction set deluxe paint animation and instant music some of them most notably deluxe paint were ported to other platforms for macintosh ea released a black  white animation tool called studio and a series of paint titles called studio and studio  in  ea published a flight simulator game exclusively for amiga fa interceptor which received attention due to its vector graphics that were notable for  standards another significant amiga release also initially available for atari st later converted for numerous other platforms was populous  developed by bullfrog productions it was a pioneering and influential title in the genre that was later called god games in  electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other consolegame publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now defunct do company in  electronic arts won the european computer trade show award for best software publisher of the year –edit headquarters of ea in october  ea is headquartered in the redwood shores neighborhood of redwood city california following the retirement and departure of trip hawkins in  ea decided to replace its logo with a new one and larry probst took over the reins in  ea made a multimilliondollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the university of southern californias interactive media division on february   electronic arts announced that it would cut worldwide staff by  percent on june   ea purchased mythic entertainment who are finished making warhammer online after segas espn nfl k successfully grabbed market share away from eas dominant madden nfl series during the  holiday season ea responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the nfl and in january  a year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april   ea announced a similar year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of eas success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platformagnostic development and the creation of strong multiyear franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises—madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc—with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in  that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property in september  nokia and ea announced a partnership in

would reorganize itself into four labels each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing the citystate model the goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decisionmaking increase creativity and quality and get games into the market faster this reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by ea of smaller studios which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of ea titles in  at the dice summit riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent riccitiello said that the citystate model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent and cited maxis and bioware as examples of studios thriving under the new structure also in  ea announced that it would be bringing some of its major titles to the macintosh ea has released battlefield  command  conquer tiberium wars crysis harry

solitude microsoft windows playstation  xbox one controversiesedit studio acquisition and management practicesedit see also list of acquisitions by electronic arts during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example originproduced ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under eas ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early  ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture in  john d carmack of id software said that ea is no longer the evil empire ill admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studiosid have been surprised if you told me a year ago that wed end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them like other ea partners such as harmonixmtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isnt really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services—valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and were probably taking a third set ea was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after they released poorly performing games for instance origin though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet  was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted—countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of  percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisofts then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july  ea elected to sell its reduced  percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly € million us million treatment of employeesedit in  electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours—up to  hours per week—and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are  am to  pm—seven days a week—with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at  pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded us million as a result many of the lowerlevel developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by programmers was settled for us million since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address worklife balance concerns by focusing on longterm project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february  in december  an internal ea employee survey showed a  increase in employee morale and a  increase in perception of management recognition over a threeyear period in may  ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and ive been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact ive actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game qualityedit for  the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as  out of   points behind nintendo  but ahead of the other firstparty publishers microsoft  and sony  the closest thirdparty publisher is taketwo interactive publishing as k games and rockstar games at  the remaining top  publishers sega thq ubisoft activision square enix all rate in the mid s since  ea has published eight games that received universal acclaim in at least one platform metacritic score  or greater battlefield  crysis rock band fifa  fifa  mass effect  mass effect  and dragon age origins eas aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankingscom aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as  which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation visàvis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that eas innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snails pace while even the companys own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying were boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinseandrepeat theres been lots of product that looked like last years product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in  ea’s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic on december   ea was hit with a class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield  dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation  and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice responded by apologizing for the bugs and promising that they would halt all production of the release of new dlc packages until they fixed the various problems sports licensing and exclusivityedit on june   a lawsuit was filed in oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasnt on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee while ea argued the players likenesses was incidentally used this was rejected by the united states courts of appeals in  a further appeal to the us supreme court was unsuccessful in june  ea settled with jim brown for  on september   ea settled a series of wideranging class action lawsuits filed by former ncaa players accusing ea and others of unauthorized use of player likenesses in their football and basketball games ea settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount the settlement is reported to be around  million to be paid to between  and  players eula and drmedit in the september  release of eas game spore it was revealed that the drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machineactivation limit of three  instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazoncom with onestar ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of infringers to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was copied and distributed well before release on september   it was announced by torrentfreaks statistics that spore was the most torrented game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command  conquer red alert  would increase the installation limit to  rather than  on september   a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october   a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march   ea released a deauthorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to deauthorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june   ea announced a change in its approach to preventing copyright infringement of pc games while eliminating the drm that uniquely identifies a machine the plan described a replacement with a traditional cdkey check with an emphasis on downloaded content the plan moved toward software as a service in  ea received criticism regarding its persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity reboot advertisingedit in  ea arranged a fake protest outside the electronic entertainment expo to draw attention to the game dantes inferno ostensibly christian protestors bore placards objecting to the games themes involving hell and damnation and it was not clear until several days later that the event had been staged several christian bloggers criticized the event for perpetuating negative stereotypes about christians a  advertising campaign for dead space  featured older women reacting negatively to the game with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space  two hundred women had been selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games and their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in eas web and tv advertisements the campaign was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing outdated stereotypes against female and older gamers as of   of video game players were women and the average game player was  years old on february   the extra credits team at the time on the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dantes inferno medal of honor and dead space  releases they argue that eas decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a first amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry mass effect s ending was poorly received by both critics and fans due to the inconsistencies between statements by bioware staff during the games development and the form the endings ultimately took displeased by the ending one player took his complaint to the federal trade commission the agency created to protect consumers his argument was that bioware did not deliver on the promise of its game saying the end product did not match with the advertising campaign and pr interviews for the game the us better business bureau also responded to the controversy supporting claims by fans that bioware falsely advertised the players complete control over the games final outcome the uks advertising standards authority disagreed ruling that ea and bioware were not guilty of false advertisement since the endings were thematically quite different and the choices and readiness rating reflected in the ending content were significant enough to avoid actionable misleading of consumers under existing law according to a reddit administrator and a former moderator of the subreddit devoted to the  star wars battlefront moderators removed posts critical of the game at the direction of ea personnel in exchange for prerelease access to the game lgbt controversiesedit see also gender representation in video games § portrayal of lgbt characters ea has been noted for its inclusion of lgbt characters in games and was among the companies given a perfect lgbt workplace score by the human rights campaign in  the positive portrayals of lgbt characters in games by ea subsidiary bioware have motivated fan support and also backlash several employees involved in dragon age ii received hate mail and threats following its release bioware lead writer david gaider responded to a fan upset by the games bisexual romances denying the fans ability to speak for all straight male gamers and writing the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is if you ask me the one who deserves it least over the years from  through  various quotes both truly and falsely attributed to bioware writer jennifer hepler were circulated online by fans who considered her emblematic of their complaints after one quote from a  interview was used to link hepler with unpopular changes to dragon age iis combat systems hepler was harassed by telephone and online the issue tapped into longstanding discontent over games being simplified to appeal to broader audiences backlash was also related to heplers writing for anders the character that prompted the straight male gamer complaint according to susana polo in the mary sue heplers gender may have intensified the harassment she experienced but it was more directly the result of her being scapegoated for eas pivot towards casual gamers ea refused to abandon plans to add gay romances to star wars the old republic that were opposed by the family research council an online petition gathered more than  signatures in support of eas decision before the petition became compromised by automated spam signatures the automated signatures were discovered by reddit and chan users who accused ea of using the issue to link broader criticism of ea with homophobia when eventually added to the game the samesex romances were ridiculed for being confined to a single gay planet the consumerist rating as worst company in americaedit in april  the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the recordbreaking poll drew in more than  votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as att and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with  votes or  this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect  ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to eas win in the poll other explanations include use of dayone dlc and eas habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying were sure that bank presidents oil tobacco and weapons companies are all relieved they werent on the list this year were going to continue making awardwinning games and services played by more than  million people worldwide in april  ea won the consumerists poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect  for its ending dead space  for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity reboot due to its poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea’s business practices that so many people have — for the second year in a row — come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don’t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims  a singleplayer offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said dungeon keeper mobile app store vote manipulationedit in  ea released dungeon keeper mobile a freetoplay mobile variant of the popular s strategy game dungeon keeper the game was poorly received by both game critics and users critics noted that an ingame prompt claimed that star ratings from you help us provide free updates suggesting that the games creators would stop providing new content if players did not give the game sufficiently high ratings the rating system involved a redirect process to the mobile storefront on which the game was sold it was also pointed out that if players rated the game anything less than  stars the game would not redirect them and not actually cast their vote never indicating this to the user this led to accusations of ea fraudulently manipulating the games rating system and its subsequent score on mobile storefronts in june  electronic arts ceo andrew wilson made a public apology for the game stating that it was a shame that he regretted in july  the ukbased advertising standards authority banned a dungeon keeper mobile ad from broadcast stating that the advertisement deliberately misled consumers and made false statements about the games pricing and freetoplay nature later that same month frank gibeau head of eas mobile division stated that the games failure was attributed to audiences not being ready and that the game innovated too much these remarks

publishers on may   ea reported  billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending march  and on january   ea announced that it had exceeded  billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year in a note to employees ea ceo john riccitiello called this an incredibly important milestone for the company ea began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site pogocom in  in  ea acquired the londonbased social gaming startup playfish and in june  ea launched origin an online service to sell downloadable games

games the company behind hits such as plants vs zombies and bejeweled ea continued its shift toward digital goods in  folding its mobilefocused ea interactive eai division into other organizations throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale –  the beginningedit founder of ea trip hawkins in february  trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc where hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capitals spare office space to start the company on may   trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated us the company was not named amazin software but instead electronic arts seven months later in december  hawkins secured us million of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sevin rosen funds electronic arts original corporate logo – for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capitals office in august  during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october   by november employee headcount rose to  including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in  including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late  and helped the company sustain growth into us million in its third full yearcitation needed this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december  david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october  hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that the company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein  partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleepcitation needed hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordons suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film troncitation needed when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying were not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsedcitation needed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of eas trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with eas packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling ea routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous fullpage magazine ads their first such ad accompanied by the slogan we see farther was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers ea also shared lavish profits with their developers which added to their industry appeal the square album cover boxes such as the covers for s mule and pinball construction set were a popular packaging concept by electronic arts which wanted to represent their developers as rock stars in the mids electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga a premier home computer of the late s and early s in europe commodore had given ea development tools and prototype machines before amigas actual launch for amiga ea published some notable nongame titles a drawing program deluxe paint  and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for amiga platform other amiga programs released by ea included deluxe music construction set deluxe paint animation and instant music some of them most notably deluxe paint were ported to other platforms for macintosh ea released a black  white animation tool called studio and a series of paint titles called studio and studio  in  ea published a flight simulator game exclusively for amiga fa interceptor which received attention due to its vector graphics that were notable for  standards another significant amiga release also initially available for atari st later converted for numerous other platforms was populous  developed by bullfrog productions it was a pioneering and influential title in the genre that was later called god games in  electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other consolegame publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now defunct do company in  electronic arts won the european computer trade show award for best software publisher of the year –edit headquarters of ea in october  ea is headquartered in the redwood shores neighborhood of redwood city california following the retirement and departure of trip hawkins in  ea decided to replace its logo with a new one and larry probst took over the reins in  ea made a multimilliondollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the university of southern californias interactive media division on february   electronic arts announced that it would cut worldwide staff by  percent on june   ea purchased mythic entertainment who are finished making warhammer online after segas espn nfl k successfully grabbed market share away from eas dominant madden nfl series during the  holiday season ea responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the nfl and in january  a year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april   ea announced a similar year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of eas success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platformagnostic development and the creation of strong multiyear franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises—madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc—with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in  that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property in september  nokia and ea announced a partnership in

ea for several years previously departed for a while and then returned riccitiello previously worked for elevation partners sara lee and pepsico in june  new ceo john riccitiello announced that ea would reorganize itself into four labels each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing the citystate model the goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decisionmaking increase creativity and quality and get games into the market faster this reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by ea of smaller studios which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of ea titles in  at the dice summit riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent riccitiello said that the citystate model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent and cited maxis and bioware as examples of studios thriving under the new structure also in  ea announced that it would be bringing some of its major titles to the macintosh ea has released battlefield  command  conquer tiberium wars crysis harry

product design marketing and demographics  in the days and weeks ahead we will make further announcements on the reporting structure for the other businesses in the casual label including ea mobile

solitude microsoft windows playstation  xbox one controversiesedit studio acquisition and management practicesedit see also list of acquisitions by electronic arts during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example originproduced ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under eas ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early  ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture in  john d carmack of id software said that ea is no longer the evil empire ill admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studiosid have been surprised if you told me a year ago that wed end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them like other ea partners such as harmonixmtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isnt really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services—valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and were probably taking a third set ea was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after they released poorly performing games for instance origin though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet  was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted—countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of  percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisofts then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july  ea elected to sell its reduced  percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly € million us million treatment of employeesedit in  electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours—up to  hours per week—and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are  am to  pm—seven days a week—with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at  pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded us million as a result many of the lowerlevel developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by programmers was settled for us million since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address worklife balance concerns by focusing on longterm project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february  in december  an internal ea employee survey showed a  increase in employee morale and a  increase in perception of management recognition over a threeyear period in may  ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and ive been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact ive actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game qualityedit for  the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as  out of   points behind nintendo  but ahead of the other firstparty publishers microsoft  and sony  the closest thirdparty publisher is taketwo interactive publishing as k games and rockstar games at  the remaining top  publishers sega thq ubisoft activision square enix all rate in the mid s since  ea has published eight games that received universal acclaim in at least one platform metacritic score  or greater battlefield  crysis rock band fifa  fifa  mass effect  mass effect  and dragon age origins eas aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankingscom aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as  which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation visàvis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that eas innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snails pace while even the companys own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying were boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinseandrepeat theres been lots of product that looked like last years product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in  ea’s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic on december   ea was hit with a class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield  dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation  and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice responded by apologizing for the bugs and promising that they would halt all production of the release of new dlc packages until they fixed the various problems sports licensing and exclusivityedit on june   a lawsuit was filed in oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasnt on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee while ea argued the players likenesses was incidentally used this was rejected by the united states courts of appeals in  a further appeal to the us supreme court was unsuccessful in june  ea settled with jim brown for  on september   ea settled a series of wideranging class action lawsuits filed by former ncaa players accusing ea and others of unauthorized use of player likenesses in their football and basketball games ea settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount the settlement is reported to be around  million to be paid to between  and  players eula and drmedit in the september  release of eas game spore it was revealed that the drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machineactivation limit of three  instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazoncom with onestar ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of infringers to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was copied and distributed well before release on september   it was announced by torrentfreaks statistics that spore was the most torrented game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command  conquer red alert  would increase the installation limit to  rather than  on september   a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october   a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march   ea released a deauthorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to deauthorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june   ea announced a change in its approach to preventing copyright infringement of pc games while eliminating the drm that uniquely identifies a machine the plan described a replacement with a traditional cdkey check with an emphasis on downloaded content the plan moved toward software as a service in  ea received criticism regarding its persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity reboot advertisingedit in  ea arranged a fake protest outside the electronic entertainment expo to draw attention to the game dantes inferno ostensibly christian protestors bore placards objecting to the games themes involving hell and damnation and it was not clear until several days later that the event had been staged several christian bloggers criticized the event for perpetuating negative stereotypes about christians a  advertising campaign for dead space  featured older women reacting negatively to the game with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space  two hundred women had been selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games and their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in eas web and tv advertisements the campaign was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing outdated stereotypes against female and older gamers as of   of video game players were women and the average game player was  years old on february   the extra credits team at the time on the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dantes inferno medal of honor and dead space  releases they argue that eas decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a first amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry mass effect s ending was poorly received by both critics and fans due to the inconsistencies between statements by bioware staff during the games development and the form the endings ultimately took displeased by the ending one player took his complaint to the federal trade commission the agency created to protect consumers his argument was that bioware did not deliver on the promise of its game saying the end product did not match with the advertising campaign and pr interviews for the game the us better business bureau also responded to the controversy supporting claims by fans that bioware falsely advertised the players complete control over the games final outcome the uks advertising standards authority disagreed ruling that ea and bioware were not guilty of false advertisement since the endings were thematically quite different and the choices and readiness rating reflected in the ending content were significant enough to avoid actionable misleading of consumers under existing law according to a reddit administrator and a former moderator of the subreddit devoted to the  star wars battlefront moderators removed posts critical of the game at the direction of ea personnel in exchange for prerelease access to the game lgbt controversiesedit see also gender representation in video games § portrayal of lgbt characters ea has been noted for its inclusion of lgbt characters in games and was among the companies given a perfect lgbt workplace score by the human rights campaign in  the positive portrayals of lgbt characters in games by ea subsidiary bioware have motivated fan support and also backlash several employees involved in dragon age ii received hate mail and threats following its release bioware lead writer david gaider responded to a fan upset by the games bisexual romances denying the fans ability to speak for all straight male gamers and writing the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is if you ask me the one who deserves it least over the years from  through  various quotes both truly and falsely attributed to bioware writer jennifer hepler were circulated online by fans who considered her emblematic of their complaints after one quote from a  interview was used to link hepler with unpopular changes to dragon age iis combat systems hepler was harassed by telephone and online the issue tapped into longstanding discontent over games being simplified to appeal to broader audiences backlash was also related to heplers writing for anders the character that prompted the straight male gamer complaint according to susana polo in the mary sue heplers gender may have intensified the harassment she experienced but it was more directly the result of her being scapegoated for eas pivot towards casual gamers ea refused to abandon plans to add gay romances to star wars the old republic that were opposed by the family research council an online petition gathered more than  signatures in support of eas decision before the petition became compromised by automated spam signatures the automated signatures were discovered by reddit and chan users who accused ea of using the issue to link broader criticism of ea with homophobia when eventually added to the game the samesex romances were ridiculed for being confined to a single gay planet the consumerist rating as worst company in americaedit in april  the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the recordbreaking poll drew in more than  votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as att and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with  votes or  this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect  ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to eas win in the poll other explanations include use of dayone dlc and eas habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying were sure that bank presidents oil tobacco and weapons companies are all relieved they werent on the list this year were going to continue making awardwinning games and services played by more than  million people worldwide in april  ea won the consumerists poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect  for its ending dead space  for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity reboot due to its poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea’s business practices that so many people have — for the second year in a row — come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don’t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims  a singleplayer offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said dungeon keeper mobile app store vote manipulationedit in  ea released dungeon keeper mobile a freetoplay mobile variant of the popular s strategy game dungeon keeper the game was poorly received by both game critics and users critics noted that an ingame prompt claimed that star ratings from you help us provide free updates suggesting that the games creators would stop providing new content if players did not give the game sufficiently high ratings the rating system involved a redirect process to the mobile storefront on which the game was sold it was also pointed out that if players rated the game anything less than  stars the game would not redirect them and not actually cast their vote never indicating this to the user this led to accusations of ea fraudulently manipulating the games rating system and its subsequent score on mobile storefronts in june  electronic arts ceo andrew wilson made a public apology for the game stating that it was a shame that he regretted in july  the ukbased advertising standards authority banned a dungeon keeper mobile ad from broadcast stating that the advertisement deliberately misled consumers and made false statements about the games pricing and freetoplay nature later that same month frank gibeau head of eas mobile division stated that the games failure was attributed to audiences not being ready and that the game innovated too much these remarks

sequoia capitals spare office space to start the company on may   trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated us the company was not named amazin software but instead electronic arts seven months later in december  hawkins secured us million of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sevin rosen funds electronic arts original corporate logo – for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capitals office in august  during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october   by november employee headcount rose to  including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in  including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late  and helped the company sustain growth into us million in its third full yearcitation needed this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december  david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october  hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that the company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein  partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleepcitation needed hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordons suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film troncitation needed when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying were not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsedcitation needed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of eas trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with eas packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling ea routinely referred to their developers as artists and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous fullpage magazine ads their first such ad accompanied by the slogan we see farther was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers ea also shared lavish profits with their developers which added to their industry appeal the square album cover boxes such as the covers for s mule and pinball construction set were a popular packaging concept by electronic arts which wanted to represent their developers as rock stars in the mids electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga a premier home computer of the late s and early s in europe commodore had given ea development tools and prototype machines before amigas actual launch for amiga ea published some notable nongame titles a drawing program deluxe paint  and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for amiga platform other amiga programs released by ea included deluxe music construction set deluxe paint animation and instant music some of them most notably deluxe paint were ported to other platforms for macintosh ea released a black  white animation tool called studio and a series of paint titles called studio and studio  in  ea published a flight simulator game exclusively for amiga fa interceptor which received attention due to its vector graphics that were notable for  standards another significant amiga release also initially available for atari st later converted for numerous other platforms was populous  developed by bullfrog productions it was a pioneering and influential title in the genre that was later called god games in  electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other consolegame publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now defunct do company in  electronic arts won the european computer trade show award for best software publisher of the year –edit headquarters of ea in october  ea is headquartered in the redwood shores neighborhood of redwood city california following the retirement and departure of trip hawkins in  ea decided to replace its logo with a new one and

with the nfl and in january  a year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april   ea announced a similar year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of eas success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platformagnostic development and the creation of strong multiyear franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises—madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc—with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in  that it would concentrate more of its effort on

publishing the citystate model the goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decisionmaking increase creativity and quality and get games into the

summit riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent riccitiello said that the citystate model allows independent

acquisition and management practicesedit see also list of acquisitions by electronic arts during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example originproduced ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under eas ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early  ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture in  john d carmack of id software said that ea is no longer the evil empire ill admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studiosid have been surprised if you told me a year ago that wed end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them like other ea partners such as harmonixmtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isnt really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services—valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and were probably taking a third set ea was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after they released poorly performing games for instance origin though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet  was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted—countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of  percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisofts then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july  ea elected to sell its reduced  percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly € million us million treatment of employeesedit in  electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours—up to  hours per week—and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are  am to  pm—seven days a week—with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at  pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded us million as a result many of the lowerlevel developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by programmers was settled for us million since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address worklife balance concerns by focusing on longterm project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february  in december  an internal ea employee survey showed a  increase in employee morale and a  increase in perception of management recognition over a threeyear period in may  ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and ive been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact ive actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game qualityedit for  the games review aggregation site metacritic

in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankingscom aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as  which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation visàvis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that eas innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snails pace while even the companys own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying were boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinseandrepeat theres been lots of product that looked like last years product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in  ea’s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic on december   ea was hit with a class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield  dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation  and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice responded by apologizing for the bugs and promising that they would halt all production of the release of new dlc packages until they fixed the various problems sports licensing and exclusivityedit on june   a lawsuit was filed in oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasnt on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee while ea argued the players likenesses was incidentally used this was rejected by the united states courts of appeals in  a further appeal to the us supreme court was unsuccessful in june  ea settled with jim brown for  on september   ea settled a series of wideranging class action lawsuits filed by former ncaa players accusing ea and others of unauthorized use of player likenesses in their football and basketball games ea settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount the settlement is reported to be around  million to be paid to between  and  players eula and drmedit in the september  release of eas game spore it was revealed that the drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machineactivation limit of three  instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazoncom with onestar ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of infringers to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was copied and distributed well before release on september   it was announced by torrentfreaks statistics that spore was the most torrented game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command  conquer red alert  would increase the installation limit to  rather than  on september   a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october   a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march   ea released a deauthorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to deauthorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june   ea announced a change in its approach to preventing copyright infringement of pc games while eliminating the drm that uniquely identifies a machine the plan described a replacement with a traditional cdkey check with an emphasis on downloaded content the plan moved toward software as a service in  ea received criticism regarding its persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity reboot advertisingedit in  ea arranged a fake protest outside the electronic entertainment expo to draw attention to the game dantes inferno ostensibly christian protestors bore placards objecting to the games themes involving hell and damnation and it was not clear until several days later that the event had been staged several christian bloggers criticized the event for perpetuating negative stereotypes about christians a  advertising campaign for dead space  featured older women reacting negatively to the game with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space  two hundred women had been selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games and their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in eas web and tv advertisements the campaign was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing outdated stereotypes against female and older gamers as of   of video game players were women and the average game player was  years old on february   the extra credits team at the time on the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dantes inferno medal of honor and dead space  releases they argue that eas decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a first amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry mass effect s ending was poorly received by both critics and fans due to the inconsistencies between statements by bioware staff during the games development and the form the endings ultimately took displeased by the ending one player took his complaint to the federal trade commission the agency created to protect consumers his argument was that bioware did not deliver on the promise of its game saying the end product did not match with the advertising campaign and pr interviews for the game the us better business bureau also responded to the controversy supporting claims by fans that bioware falsely advertised the players complete control over the games final outcome the uks advertising standards authority disagreed ruling that ea and bioware were not guilty of false advertisement since the endings were thematically quite different and the choices and readiness rating reflected in the ending content were significant enough to avoid actionable misleading of consumers under existing law according to a reddit administrator and a former moderator of the subreddit devoted to the  star wars battlefront moderators removed posts critical of the game at the direction of ea personnel in exchange for prerelease access to the game lgbt controversiesedit see also gender representation in video games § portrayal of lgbt characters ea has been noted for its inclusion of lgbt characters in games and was among the companies given a perfect lgbt workplace score by the human rights campaign in  the positive portrayals of lgbt characters in games by ea

options for others is if you ask me the one who deserves it least over the years from  through  various quotes both truly and falsely attributed to bioware writer jennifer hepler were circulated online by fans who considered her emblematic of their complaints after one quote from a  interview was used to link hepler with unpopular changes to dragon age iis combat systems hepler was harassed by telephone and online the issue tapped into longstanding discontent over games being simplified to appeal to broader audiences backlash was also related to heplers writing for anders the character that prompted the straight male gamer complaint according to susana polo in the mary sue heplers gender may have intensified the harassment she experienced but it was more directly the result of her being scapegoated for eas pivot towards casual gamers ea refused to abandon plans to add gay romances to star wars the old republic that were opposed by the family research council an online petition gathered more than  signatures in support of eas decision before the petition became compromised by automated spam signatures the automated signatures were discovered by reddit and chan users who accused ea of using the issue to link broader criticism of ea with homophobia when eventually added to the game the samesex romances were ridiculed for being confined to a single gay planet the consumerist rating as worst company in americaedit in april  the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the recordbreaking poll drew in more than  votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as att and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with  votes or  this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect  ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to eas win in the poll other explanations include use of dayone dlc and eas habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying were sure that bank presidents oil tobacco and weapons companies are all relieved they werent on the list this year were going to continue making awardwinning games and services played by more than  million people worldwide in april  ea won the consumerists poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect  for its ending dead space  for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity reboot due to its poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea’s business practices that so many people have — for the second year in a row — come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don’t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims  a singleplayer offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said dungeon keeper mobile app store vote manipulationedit in  ea released dungeon keeper mobile a freetoplay mobile variant of the popular s strategy game dungeon keeper the game was poorly received by both game critics and users critics noted that an ingame prompt claimed that star ratings from you help us provide free updates suggesting that the games creators would stop providing new content if players did not give the game sufficiently high ratings the rating system involved a redirect process to the mobile storefront on which the game was sold it was also pointed out that if players rated the game anything less than  stars the game would not redirect them and not actually cast their vote never indicating this to the user this led to accusations of ea fraudulently manipulating the games rating system and its subsequent score on mobile storefronts in june  electronic arts ceo andrew wilson made a public apology for the game stating that it was a shame that he regretted in july  the ukbased advertising standards authority banned a dungeon keeper mobile ad from broadcast stating that the advertisement deliberately misled consumers and made false statements about the games pricing and freetoplay nature later that same month frank gibeau head of eas mobile division stated that the games failure was attributed to audiences not being ready and that the game innovated too much these remarks resulted in backlash from game journalist media and users alike see
