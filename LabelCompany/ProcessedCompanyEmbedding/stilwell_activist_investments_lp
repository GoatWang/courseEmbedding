nasdaq wayne savings sends letter to stockholdersbusiness wirefebruary  reblogsharetweetsharewooster ohiobusiness wirewayne savings bancshares inc “wayne savings” or the “bank” wayn the holding company parent of wayne savings community bank today sent a letter to its stockholders concerning the nomination of a candidate to the board of directors of the bank by stilwell activist investments lp and its affiliatesincluded below is the full text of the letter to wayne savings stockholdersfebruary  dear fellow wayne savings stockholderby now some of you may have heard that a hedge fund headquartered in new york city called stilwell activist investments has called for wayne savings to be sold to another bank and has nominated a lawyer from kentucky to join the wayne savings board of directorsimportantly you should know that wayne savings has always been and will always be open to constructive dialogue with our shareholders we carefully consider all of the input that you have we believe however that the stilwell fund’s actions to launch a disruptive proxy contest are both unwarranted and counterproductivethe bank is strong financially as of december   we are well capitalized by regulatory standards with a total capital ratio of  well in excess of the regulatory threshold in january  wayne savings received the highest possible rating  stars for financial strength and stability from the nation’s leading bank rating firm bauer financial in short wayne savings is a strong bank with a healthy balance sheetshareholders have been rewarded we believe that we best serve our shareholders by maximizing the intrinsic value of the company and do not place undue focus on the daytoday stock price fluctuations with that said we have delivered strong total shareholder returns over a period of many years total shareholder returns ¹                   one year period       three year period       five year period   wayn                snl us bank and thrift index                sp                   ¹ assuming stockholders reinvest dividends by purchasing additional shares we are also proud to say that wayne savings has had a history of returning capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and stock buybacks we have paid a quarterly dividend in every quarter of our existence this stands in contrast to many other banks that eliminated their dividends or failed altogether during the financial crisis in fact in the last five years we have returned two thirds of our net income to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchasesthe board continues to pursue enhanced value our board is focused on doing what is in the best interests of all shareholders an integral part of that is finding the right longterm leadership for our company and filling the chief executive officer role that was vacated just over one month ago despite any distractions the board continues to meet with and pursue potential candidates for the positionwe are fortunate to have the stewardship of the company’s president and chief executive officer david lehman mr lehman has served on the board since  and has over  years of experience in the financial services industry he knows our company knows our community – the focus of our business – and has been a key contributor to our successstilwell’s actions are counterproductive the stilwell fund has stated that the board “has not succeeded in building shareholder value” as we have pointed out above that simply isn’t correct through the dedicated efforts of our employees we have built a bank that has delivered positive returns to shareholders over many years and – essential to longterm future shareholder value – is financially soundmore importantly there appears to be a disconnect between what stilwell fund wants and the board’s goal to create longterm shareholder value the stilwell fund has entered into a compensation arrangement with its nominee whereby  of the stock options granted to stilwell’s nominee by the stilwell fund will only be exercisable if wayne savings is sold or undergoes a similar “changeincontrol” transaction within  years of the shareholder vote consider the stark conflict of interest even if longterm shareholder value is maximized by remaining independent the stilwell fund’s nominee will have this substantial incentive to push for a sale of the company neverthelessthe  annual meeting as in years past this year we will send you a proxy statement seeking votes for the company’s nominees for director we ask that you review our proxy materials when you receive them and sign date and mail the white proxy card that accompanies these materialsread moreit is possible that you will also receive a proxy statement and proxy card from the stilwell fund seeking the authority to vote your shares of company stock in favor of its nominee we urge our shareholders not to take any action in response to any other proxy materials until you receive and review the company’s definitive proxy materialsif you have any questions or would like us to contact you please do not hesitate to reach out to our investor relations department at   you can also call our proxy solicitor alliance advisors llc at  we welcome the thoughts of all of our shareholders while it continues to be our hope that the expense and distraction of a proxy contest can be avoided we are prepared to undertake whatever efforts are needed to do what is right we appreciate all of your ongoing supporton behalf of the board of directors of wayne
