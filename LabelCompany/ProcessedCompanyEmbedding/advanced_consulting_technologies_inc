nanotechnology company which enables electronic components to be effectively and economically waterrepellent and not detectable by users either visually or by touch most electronics in the world today are vulnerable to water damage accidental water damage can short out and often ruin the circuitry of cell phones laptops ereaders digital cameras electronic key fobs television remotes coffee makers and many other devices that are often used in the proximity of water other liquids and even simply humidity while some electronic devices are built and labeled as water repellent they are comparatively few in number and they often feature watertight external enclosures that house the electronic components inside act owns the intellectual property of more than  revolutionary coatings act is also able to provide expertise in the application of these coatings in a factory environment act participates as an integral team member in testing and adding this process to manufacturing lines for our customers act offers a number of nano coatings that can be applied to electronic devices in a way that makes them waterrepellent to ipx levels in other words a cell phone or notebook computer will work just fine after being dropped in a bucket of water this protection is undetectable to the human eye or touch as it is applied on a nano scale  millionth of a millimeter the coatings can be applied to devices in various stages of the manufacturing process including after the finished product is built act delivers unique value to electronic device manufacturers through its ability to adapt the coating and optimized application technology to the needs of each manufacturer in some cases highly economical dipping of components in a nano particleinfused bath is ideal while in other situations spraying or wiping is better act is skilled in all aspects of the technology and advises with each client to help decide where in the manufacturing process this coating should be added and
