federal reserve… the reformed broker peter boockvar dear federal reserve…posted december   by joshua m brown peter has something to get off his chest posted in full with his permission an open letter to the fed hope you enjoy – jbdear federal reserveas we approach your last get together of the year i first want to wish you all great holidays and a happy and healthy new year i also want to extend my utmost respect for the time you have given to public service in your contribution of what is the federal reserve system with the best intentions but as they say with the best intentions it leads to roads unforeseen to put it nice as it is year end it’s always a good time for reflection and let’s look in the mirror togetherthe predominant investing rallying cry over the last  years of the ‘greenspan now fed put’ and ‘search for yield’ without regard to risk is again showing its darker side this time in the energy patch we of course saw it first in technology land in the late ’s to be repeated in a different fashion in the mid ’s via credit and housing and now in the us oil and gas industry thanks to those two sayings the us economy has become the us ‘boom and bust’ economy your sole focus on consumer price inflation has again shifted your attention from the negative repercussions of excessive asset price inflation that inevitably always mean reverts this time an epic bond bubble is showing some big time cracks in corporate landwithout rehashing the two previous bubbles let’s talk about the new one and focus on the ‘search for yield’ without regard to risk syndrome that again created extreme asset price inflation and again got hold of parts of our economy via another one of your cycles of interest rates well below the rate of inflation the manhandling of longer term interest rates with qe and amazing american ingenuity and technology anyone with a drill bit and a land lease was able to get a loan as long as oil prices levitated north of  bloomberg estimates that since early  b loans and bonds were issued by the oil and gas industry give me yield or give me death was essentially the mantra for this and many other investments and the money kept flowing the drilling kept coming and all of a sudden the spurt in supply bumped up against a slowing global economy and then poof the bubble burst essentially in a crash with crude prices falling by  over the past  months not coincidentally either just as qe was endingwhich brings us to another one of your meetings this week where the debate now and for  is when and how do you normalize interest rates and whether your focus should be the better labor market and the improvement in wage gains in november or more so the sudden drop in commodity prices mostly driven by lower oil prices the irony of this discussion though hopefully won’t escape you cheap money that you created fueled a drilling boom that oversupplied a market that now has shrinking demand now with lower oil prices headline inflation and inflation expectations as a result you may actually use low inflation as an excuse to keep rates low for longer the same policy that previously created the boom and now the bust in your desire for higher inflation cheap money instead lead to malinvestment and over capacity that inevitably lead to a downside and lower pricesthose fiber optic cables would have been laid anyway those homes would have been built anyway and those shale wells would have been drilled anyway but the ‘fed put’ and ‘search for yield’ rallying cries brought so much of this activity together at once in their respective time periods that the boom it created inevitably lead to the busts that followed you know excessively easy monetary policy not only buys time it steals economic activity from the future buy and invest today maybe what you would have done tomorrow but tomorrow always comes why isn’t this lesson ever learnedi will sum up with this history is replete with the bad economic consequences of trying to manipulate human behavior with government induced price controls over the last  years especially it’s been control over the price of money and current policy is as if we have an economic five alarm fire i’m not calling for you to quickly normalize policy immediately i just believe that the process must begin however slowly as soon as possible and asset price inflation should no longer be ignored or only acknowledged with vague comments about overvaluation in select asset markets words and macro prudential regulation are not going to do it the path ahead will be disruptive but that can no longer be avoided as  years of zirp and a  fold increase in your balance sheet has already way overstayed its welcome the longer you wait the worse the consequences will be when you do again
