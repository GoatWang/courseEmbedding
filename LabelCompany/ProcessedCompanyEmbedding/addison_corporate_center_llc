million in rental income from the property for personal use andor use by other entities owned andor controlled by the company and its management teamit appears that these funds may have been redirected in fraud of creditors the suit saidabout  in monthly rental income from the property was supposed to be set aside to pay debt service and other expenses but there was only about  going into the reserve court papers saidsince the suit was filed in august chance said the property has been stabilized although investors still dont know where the alleged missing funds are they also havent

the master lease agreement with leaseco has been terminated and that cabot investment is no longer involved with the daytoday operations of the propertyapproximately  in rental income has also been set aside in an escrow account to pay off unpaid commissions although the rights to those funds havent been determined by the court valvano saidoutstanding utility expenses are now paid valvano saidthe big issues left will be trying to figure out where the alleged  million in missing funds have gone and keeping the property out of foreclosure the original mortgage from wachovia bank was
