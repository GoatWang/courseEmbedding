september  sourcessophie sassard min readlondon reuters  music streaming company spotify is close to agreeing a new licensing pact with warner music inc the last big music royalty deal it needs before pushing ahead with a us stock market listing four sources familiar with the situation said the parties are positive a deal could be signed by september as major issues such as granting lossmaking spotify a more favorable revenue split in return for making some new albums accessible only to its paying subscribers for a defined period have already been agreed the sources said however the precise revenue split and the size of a potential guaranteed upfront payment to the label home to artists including ed sheeran and muse have yet to be agreed said two of the sources the negotiations are at a crossroads said one of the sources asking not to be named because the talks are private adding discussions were taking place daily there are still a number of key points that remain to be agreed if we manage to come to terms on these points then it could lead to a very quick transaction if not any deal would remain at bay others saw a deal being done by late summer given the way talks are progressing i would be surprised if we dont have a deal in september said another source on the other side of the table spotify takes wing swedens spotify has grown in less than a decade into the worlds most popular streaming music service but its financial sustainability hinges on its ability to strike music licensing contracts at less onerous royalty rates basic features of spotify are free and supported by advertising while paying subscribers enjoy unlimited listening and other premium features it faces mounting competition from far bigger internet players such as apple aaplo and amazon amzno which can afford to subsidize their push into music by drawing on money they make in other businesses the streaming firm which was recently valued at  billion is pushing for a  revenue split but warner music is demanding it retains at least  percent of the royalties in line with the other labels according to the sources under the terms of their current agreement spotify pays  percent of royalties to warner warner is also pushing to receive a guaranteed upfront payment regardless of subscription growth said one of the sources the label owned by billionaire investor len blavatniks access industries is also asking for protection against the potential rise of unsigned artists who could over time reduce its revenue share a smartphone with a headset with spotify logo are seen in front of a displayed warner music logo in this illustration picture taken july  dado ruvicthis follows recent press reports that spotify was filling its playlists with anonymous or little known artists to reduce the influence of the majors said one of the sources warner would be ready to reduce its royalties rate from  percent to  percent provided these issues were resolved said the same person spotify declined to comment other deals earlier this year the swedish company struck a licensing deal with vivendis vivpa universal music group umg to pay the worlds largest label a lower royalty rate this was recently followed by a similar agreement with sony music spotify didnt disclose the terms of the deals but it was widely reported that the streaming firm had managed to lower the royalty rate from about  percent to  percent based on growing volumes of paying listeners slideshow  imagesin return the streaming service agreed to restrict new albums to paying subscribers for a couple of weeks before offering access to free users as of june spotify had  million paying users or  percent of streaming music subscribers worldwide according to midia research it has more than  million active users including free listeners by comparison apple had  percent or  million music subscribers in june up from  million in december while amazon held  percent or  million subscribers midia estimated heading for the market one of the sources said spotify which hired goldman sachs and morgan stanley to advise it on a stock market listing is still aiming to go public via a direct listing toward the end of this year or the beginning of the next spotify recorded revenues of  billion euros for  up  percent from  according to company filings in luxembourg in june operating losses grew  percent to  million euros but including financing costs its losses before tax leapt  percent to  million euros last year universal held a  percent share of global music label revenue sony music generated  percent and warner  percent independent labels made up the remaining  percent according to midia research the company has faced boycotts from some top music artists who have complained its free services undercut the value of their work but the major label licensing deals have gone some way toward easing these tensions according to analysts additional reporting by eric auchard in

one sentence a look back at early interviews with facebook and uber ceos illustrates an ingenious way to communicate hardtodescribe products by dave bailey dave bailey is a venture partner at downing ventures in london cofounder of cheeky weekend and product mentor for google launchpad davesuperman serial entrepreneur and venture partnerdavesuperman write a comment mark zuckerberg credit getty images as a founder i spent countless hours refining my elevator pitch and practicing it every chance i got i learned that leading with the need is an extremely effective way to position your product as solving an important problem for your customers its a shame that most potential customers dont hear about my product from me like  percent of startup founders i rely on word of mouth to promote my product the catch is that my customers havent learned my wellpracticed elevator pitch worse still they dont have a full  seconds to explain how the product works in detailim lucky if they take more than three seconds to describe it how customers talk about your product your product will only come up in conversations when its perceived as being relevant to that conversation heres a typical wordofmouth scenario something triggers your customer to remember your product for example perhaps somebody has described the need that your product addresses your customer will introduce your product tentatively with a question have you heard about product x without much setup your customer jumps headfirst into a simplified description of how it workstypically in a single sentence if the description resonates great if not your customer will justify why they think its relevant to the conversation and move on i wanted to know why some onesentence descriptions sound like a genius idea and others flop as i researched how the founders of successful startups presented their products before they were wellknown i discovered something interesting viral products tend to have a lead feature in this early interview before facebooks ipo mark zuckerberg describes facebook as something where you can type someones name and find out a bunch of information about them mark is describing one of facebooks featuresthe ability to view profiles of real people there is no talk of social networks or helping the world to connect to each other just a simple and practical description of a key feature of the product in  travis kalanick described uber at the  mark as a mobile app where you push a button and in five minutes a mercedes picks you up and takes you where you want to go travis doesnt lead with buzzwords like platform and marketplace instead he focuses on just one button and uses vividly specific language to make the outcome extremely appealing today uber has further simplified it to tap a button get a ride the format of both descriptions is the same you do x and y happens x is the input and y is the output this inputoutput pair matches our intuition about how software works simplifying the product as a straightforward input and desirable output creates the sense that its an ingenious idea facebook and uber have thousands of features yet mark and travis elevate a single feature above the others making the product easy to understand easy to remember and most importantly easy to talk about how to promote a feature to lead feature a products features are usually highly interconnected making it hard to know which one to choose ive found it helpful to think through the user experience chronologically find the first unique feature thats highly desirable to the user and describe it in terms of inputs and outcomes if you choose a feature without a clear input you risk confusing the user presenting a feature that other products have invites the terrorinducing question of why is it different from x for example facebook allows users to share photos with friends but if mark led with this feature it would beg the question why cant i just use email id argue that even the most complex saas platforms can be simplified with an illustrative lead feature but what if your product is the exception in that case its not a good idea to rely on word of mouth to grow your business if you find it hard to describe imagine how hard it will be for your customers in this case a salesforce might be a more reliable channel tactical or strategic its easy to mistake a oneline description as just another communications tactic however crafting this sentence is one of the most strategic decisions a founder can make if we want our product to be shared by word of mouth then we must accept that it will likely pass from person to person as a single sentence figuring out this sentence early in the process can focus our product development on the inputs and outputs that really matter and our marketing efforts on helping us enter the right conversations seize the opportunity to craft and test single sentences earlybefore you build something thats too hard to describe the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on mar   taylor swift returns her music catalog to streaming services  the new york times
