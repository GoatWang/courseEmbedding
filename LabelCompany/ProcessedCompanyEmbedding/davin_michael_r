michael davin michael r davin thank you scott and good morning everyone strong demand in our domestic business drove another quarter of doubledigit top line growth total revenue increased  to  million a record for the third quarter from the  million in the same period of last year north american product revenue was up  yearoveryear led by contributions from our picosure monalisa touch and icon products q mark the th consecutive yearoveryear quarterly increase for our domestic business this performance speaks to our commitment to delivering innovative high quality laser systems that are significantly improving esthetic health of consumers outside of north america product revenue was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of last year reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and recent on unrest in the middle east as well as a continued economic weakness in china on a constant currency basis international product revenue was up  yearoveryear looking at the proportion of revenue by region north america accounted for  of product sales in the third quarter compared with  in the same period a year earlier the higher percentage of business from north america contributed to an improvement in our adjusted gross margin which improved  basis points to  in the quarter on the bottom line our plan to increasing sales and marketing investments primarily related to the sculpsure launch impacted net income performance in q as tim explained at last month’s investor day in new york we expect to recover the operating leverage as we move forward with the sculpsure launch turning to recent developments the preliminary us release of sculpsure the worlds first hyperthermic laser for noninvasive fat reduction of the flanks and abdomen is underway we began initial shipments in q and weve trained sales personnel in a number of key territories as well as play systems with several industry luminaries the response from physicians and patients has been extremely favorable in recent weeks sculpsure was also demonstrated at the american society for dermatologic surgery annual meeting in chicago and the  meeting of the american society of plastic surgeons in boston internationally sculpsure was unveiled at this months th european academy of dermatology and venereology congress in copenhagen in addition training has been conducted at our direct sales offices in europe and australia this follows our recite in q of ce mark approval for sculpsure a key milestone in the commercialization of the product throughout the european union as we highlighted at our investor day our marketing strategy with sculpsure centers on delivering a worldclass platform directly to the physician our turnkey approaching includes resources and the field dedicated to marketing support to help practitioners to establishing grow their sculpsure practices as well as clinical specialists in the field who will provide ongoing clinical support to help and ensure that concerned customers are taking full advantage of sculpsure’s versatility and unique treatment options now let me update you on the progress of monalisa touch our fractional co laser therapy for gynecologic health q marked the third full quarter we have distributed the product in north america and the sales ramp continues to be positive as i mentioned on our second quarter earnings call our  dedicated specialty sales forces in place and we are very pleased with the success of recent marketing initiatives including webinars workshops and tradeshows and driving interest in the technology from the research perspective a scientific poster on monalisa touch was presented this month at the  annual meeting of the north american menopause society the poster presented the findings from a us study of  patients with genitourinary syndrome of menopause or gsm who are treated with a monalisa touch the study conducted by gynecologist eric sokol of stanford university school of medicine and mickey karram of the christ hospital in cincinnati concluded that the laser is an effective and safe method for the treatment of symptoms associated with gsm a total of  of patients reported that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their treatment while no patients reported that they were dissatisfied monalisa touch will also be the subject of symposium and an abstract presentation at a major gynecology meeting in las vegas next month the symposium will review outcome data from italian and us studies on the use of the monalisa touch laser therapy and discuss the effect of the monalisa touch laser treatment on a variety of gynecologic conditions another important and recent development for us was the china food and drug administration clearance of our  nanometer wavelength picosure for laser tattoo removal this clearance is part of our broader strategy to market and distribute picosure internationally for a broad range of applications including treatment of wrinkles and acne scars as well as the removal of pigmented lesions you will recall the  nanometer picosure received us fda clearance in late  for the removal of tattoos and benign pigmented lesions and subsequently received marketing clearance in canada australia korea and taiwan last year with the addition of the focus lens array our disposable energy delivery system picosure gained expanded us clearances for the treatment of wrinkles and acne scars so the takeaway here is that we continue to have multiple growth opportunities with the picosure product in summary we enter our seasonally strongest quarter with solid momentum the full us launch of sculpsure is on schedule for the first quarter of  which we plan to coincide with the rollout of the product to our european direct offices in france germany as well as australia the key objectives with respect to sculpsure for the year ahead include securing additional international registrations gaining expanded clearances for treatment areas in addition to flanks and abdomen pursuing aesthetic indications beyond noninvasive fat reduction and adding new distribution channels now let me turn the call over to tim for his financial review tim timothy w baker thanks mike and good morning everyone as mike noted our third quarter revenue increased  as compared to the third quarter of  to  million which marks a q record of cynosure product revenue rose  to  million or  of total revenue revenue from parts service and disposables increased  to  million primarily reflecting picosures focus lens array and consumables associated with the ellmen product line looking at product revenue by region north america increased  over the prior year to  million and accounted for  of total product revenue revenue from products sold outside of north america was essentially flat compared to q of  at  million or  of total product revenue primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as well as continued economic weakness in the emea and china on a constant currency basis international product revenue increased  from the third quarter of  net income for the third quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared with net income of  million and also  per diluted share for the prior year period excluding acquisition cost noncash unrealized foreign exchange measurement losses and amortization of intangibles nongaap net income for the third quarter of  was  million or  per diluted share using an effective tax rate of  this compared with  million or  per diluted share for the third quarter of  also using effective tax rate of  as mike mentioned the variance primarily reflects sales and marketing investments associated with the sculpsure launch please see this mornings release for a reconciliation of third quarter  nongaap result to the most directly comparable gaap results gross margin for the third quarter was  compared with  for the same period in  on an adjusted basis excluding noncash charges related to the amortization of intangibles gross margin was  in the third quarter of  compared with  in the same period a year earlier excluding amortization and acquisition cost operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were  compared with  in the third quarter of last year sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of  were  million with  of revenue reflecting the ongoing addition of sales and marketing personnel and marketing initiatives associated with the launch of sculpsure gaap operating margin was  for the third quarter of  compared with  for the third quarter of  excluding acquisition and amortization expense adjusted operating margin was  for the third quarter of  compared with  for the third quarter of  again reflecting investments in sales and marketing we expect to see improved operating leverage in q and into  for the third quarter of  we incurred approximately  million in noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangibles of which  million was charged to cost of goods sold we expect to incur similar amortization cost for the fourth quarter of  our balance sheet remains strong we generated  million in cash flow from operation resulting in cash and investments totaling  million at september  to compare with  million at yearend  we did not purchase any shares in the third quarter under our previously authorized share buyback program and at september  had approximately  million available under our  million share repurchase program day sales outstanding were  days at the end of q down from  days for q of  before we go to qa i want to let you know that mike and i will be participating in two upcoming conferences in new york city on monday november  we will be meeting with investors at the brean capital  life science summit and the following day we will be presenting at the safo  healthcare conference with that mike and i will be happy to take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of richard newitter with leerink partners please proceed with your question richard newitter hi guys thanks for taking the questions solid quarter i was hoping to maybe start on the ous just i know thats been a little bit of a trouble spot for you guys but you saw some improvement this quarter so i would love i think now you are into positive territory on a constant currency basis maybe you could just tell us a little bit about what you are seeing in some of the regions last quarter you said you had some macro issues how much of this is potentially some share gains and what should we expect for this business going forward michael r davin yes rich obviously we are still striving for a better performance in the international markets but we believe much of the performance is in relationship in macro environments but we just really don’t have any control over the situation especially china and in the middleeast our largest distributor actually comes out of the middleeast and our largest subsidiary is our china business our four different china offices there so i don’t believe there has been a lot of positive news coming out recently in those two geographical areas that lead us to believe that there is going to be a significant improvement in business but we even made some changes ourselves whether its been our strategy and how we are going to go after the business in those regions or recent clearances for example in china the picosure clearance that we received right at the end of the quarter we believe will be a nice stimulus for new growth which would be completely new to that region now having the first ever picosure device cleared in china as it relates to middleeast we believe things will calm down there a little bit and weve had great meetings with the leadership and our distributor there and so they are seeing a little bit of improvement and historically q has done a strong quarter there europe we would say is stable and we hope to see a stronger quarter coming out of q but a lot of that again is going to depend on what happens from the macro perspective richard newitter okay so still challenged but clearly you guys are at least for cyno making some progress got it okay if i could just turn just quickly to fx tim what was the overall fx impact to worldwide sales what was your constant currency growth for the overall top line and what if any impact was there to eps timothy w baker so overall it was about  million on the revenue line from fx perspective again on the fx again not as impact because you have got again our subsidiaries all operating and local currency from pl perspective so on the eps line its fairly neutral but on the top line its  million of which  related to product sales laser product sales richard newitter okay very helpful then just one quick one tria i think last year you guys had a particularly tough comp because you had some tria revenue can you just tell us maybe your underlying performance might have actually been understated this quarter could you break that contribution out in the prior year quarter and what your growth would have been excluding that timothy w baker well ill let you do the math but last year q  we had  million tria settlement which obviously did not repeat this year so you have a  million onetime pick up in q and q of  related to the tria settlement richard newitter okay so maybe you guys even did closest to midteens growth when you back that out timothy w baker yes richard newitter okay and then just lastly on us north america coming in at  thats obviously an incredibly strong performance once again can you give us any granularity on the contribution to that growth monalisa clearly continues to gain attraction based on our checks can you give us any directional color on how much of the growth is coming from monalisa versus some of the maybe the ellmen versus kind of your core business michael r davin yes rich as you know we dont breakout revenue by product but we are very pleased not only with qs performance in north america but the year i think the year we’re up  in north america for the first nine months which was excellent and we do believe its across the board as i mentioned whether its icon’s performance picosures performance certainly monalisa touch as well as the ellmen contributions as tim mentioned conbio continues to do well for us we just have a very diversified product portfolio right now with several different levers that are doing extremely well in north america and as you know north america received clearances for these devices usually well ahead of our international markets and thats why we are very pleased to get the clearance for picosure in china but i just think overall a great contribution from our north american distribution and being very focused on the complete product portfolio im getting real nice performance across the board operator our next question comes from the line of difei yang with brean capital please proceed with your question difei yang good morning thanks for taking my questions so for the pending european launch of offshore how should we think about the potential uptake curve is there anything that we should think about european market dynamics might be different from north american market michael r davin yes so as i mentioned we trained our direct offices on sculpsure at the european academy of dermatology meeting which was in copenhagen in the middle of october the training went very well so our direct offices in germany spain uk and france and we also had our australian office there for training as well anticipating australian clearance hopefully fairly soon the training was very well and our folks in europe are engaged now in building the infrastructure similar to what we are creating here in the us from the marketing initiatives as well as the clinical initiatives and distribution initiatives they are very excited to have the product and what we are hearing from luminaries in europe is they really buy into the hyperthermic approach versus other approaches that are on the market today and really understand the physics behind using a hyperthermicbased device and they love the versal applicator system we believe the market is also very very large the one difference there that we dont see as much of here in the united states is there are number of competitive products especially from criogen ph perspective there is probably four different criogen products in the market there but we dont really see those products here in the united states so we believe that also offers us leverage with having the hyperthermic device having the versal applicator system having the shorter treatment time to physician against what we believe is a fairly confused market in the europe with a number of not only of criogen devices but other types of devices that have been introduced by small companies to address body contouring so our offices are very excited about the launch as we mentioned we really wont to see any traction as it relates to the release of the product there until q difei yang thank you for the additional color just a followup with regards to the us market for noninvasive fat reduction we have a number of different approaches and from the initial launch do you hear from the position that they tend to like different modality of the machines in their office or do they tend to just make a decision go with one technology michael r davin no i mean we are very early as we mentioned in the investor day in terms of the penetration of technology as it relates to the addressable market in north america and definitely from a global perspective weve really believe there has been one company that has the majority the market share and there has been other product that have been introduced to the market but for variety of reasons they haven’t been that successful so i believe now that our solution is available and a number of our doctors that whether its luminary related or some of our early shipments they either own other technology or they don’t but some of them do own the leading technology on the market and they are excited about offering what sculpsure brings to their patients from a differentiation perspective especially the versal applicator system where they can treat multiple anatomical areas at one time and they also see enormous value in the shorter treatment time where they can really drive throughput not only for noninvasive body contouring procedures but they are able to free up treatment rooms for other cosmetic indications such as fillers injectables skin rejuvenation so we are very early in the game we don’t believe at all that physicians will be centric to one technology we believe the market and the opportunity is so significant that they will have multiple different types of technology to address this high volume indication difei yang okay thank you and one last question when do you think  i assume would be sometime next year that you might be able to guide us with regards to how sculpsure is doing on the uptake side will that happen sometime in  michael r davin yes as traditional with cynosure you in past flagship product launches we will keep everybody informed on our course of action which we are really not deviating with sculpsure versus any other product we launch and that’s to see the market with our key opinion leaders to continue to drive excellent clinical data as it relates to the product we expect they have the very exciting american society for laser medicines and surgery meeting for sculpsure which will held in boston this year and late march and april we are getting our distribution well positioned and trained globally and so we will keep everybody updated the new infrastructural investments we are making from a marketing and clinical perspective and so we will keep you posted from that perspective in terms of breaking out the financials as it relates to sculpsure we will handle sculpsure in a traditional manner as we have every other flagship product weve launched over the past tenyears difei yang okay thank you and congrats on a great quarter scott solomon thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of john block with stifel please proceed with your questions john block great thanks and good morning guys maybe be just two or three first on monalisa we believe the result have been very solid in aiding the north america results can you comment on your ability to possibly secure the worldwide rights for that product and in a  north american reps for monalisa what are the thoughts about expanding that really at a higher level how do you balance the incremental dollar between sculpsure and monalisa michael r davin right now we have the exclusive distribution john in north america and we are pending the heath canada clearance for the product and as it relates to other opportunities outside of north america we believe there are some opportunities where we will be able to distribute the technology from the supplier but right now we are dedicated right now in selling at just in the united states and we are anticipating health canada soon but yes there is an opportunity to have additional international market opportunities and we are in discussions as it relates to that opportunity with the supplier as it relates to the  specialist we really just completed the hiring of those folks at the end of q so this is really two quarters that they have been in the field we have done this before in creating a bifurcated distribution whether it was only introduced to pinpoint veronica ph mycosis or our specialty sales force our minimally invasive products with cellulaze and with smartlipo so we will size accordingly i think probably there is an interest to while i know images to explore developing that distribution even greater based on the success we are having but we believe right now we are sized appropriately but as we look to  there is a good possibility that we may add additional feet on the street dedicated to this opportunity john block okay perfect that was very helpful and then just to shift gears to sculpsure for a second can you just talk about the additional indications for sculpsure and maybe any timing or color there i guess where im go with it i believe in seeing the system in boston the current system can be used off label for thought but how about some momentum just when i look at that system are you going to need a new hand piece or an on addon to treat something like submental michael r davin yes so we are looking at a number of options as it relates to this technology not only for treating other anatomical areas but also for broadening the technology for the use in enhanced body contouring indications so we are not going to get into what those are for obvious reason but one of the beauties of a hyperthermic device versus other technology in the market that’s extremely limited in its capabilities to be diversified is that we can modify the technologies so that can do other things and certainly our years history of using hyperthermic approaches or laser based devises we are well aware and our knowledge of years of being the leader in minimally invasive fat removal with smartlipo we have a lot of experience and knowledge on potential other opportunities for this device so we are exploring those right now aggressively from a research prospective and development prospective as it relates to other anatomical areas we are pursuing rest of body clearance we also know that submental is a very important area of treatment and yes we are defiantly exploring that opportunities as well with the current platform john block great and last one i promise and then i’ll just jump back in the queue tim for you just on the share report i think you said nothing was done in the quarter i believe just  million on the prior that expires in november if i’m correct and then you just any thoughts you have  not asking  guidance but any cadence to leverage i mean just when we think about how you are bringing on the spend and ramp in some of these new product like sculpsure thanks guys timothy w baker so john relative to the side back you are we have  million left i believe it does not expire in november it goes at least throughout the next year we have not purchased anything yeartodate in this year as pricing at this levels but there is  million still available and i think it goes to august of next year in terms of the spend as we talked about at the sculpsure investor meeting in september we did talked about kind of initial investment and looked at a sales and marketing as a percentage at revenue at  target for this quarter which came in at  so we are a little better than that but i’ll talk you about in terms of the investment in terms of marketing spend and hiring these additional personnel as mike talked about putting these direct resources in the field whether it would be sales resources marketing resources clinical resources our whole approach is to bring these recourses to the customer and that takes that short term investment upfront so we do see that happening now we saw that this past quarter we do see that continuing in q but as we mentioned in september we do expect to see that begins to leverage as early as q as we increased the shipment level of sculpsure leading to the full launch in q but just even on incremental sculpsure revenue we anticipate in q we think we will see some revenue leveraging that down to more on that  to  on sales and marketing so we do expect to see leverage fairly quickly and improving even more as we go out into  john block great thank you scott solomon thanks john operator our next question comes from a line of suraj kalia with northland securities please proceed with your question suraj kalia good morning gentlemen congrats on a nice quarter once again scott solomon thanks suraj suraj kalia so michael a couple of question for you and then i’ll go over to tim nine months into the rollout of monalisa touch michael and i know you guys don’t give specific can you give us some directional color just for us to get a handle on the adoption rate yes we are getting the anecdotal information from the field but can you give us some idea in terms of these when you centers have shown interest these many procedures per center just some color to give us a qualitative aspect on monalisa touch in the us michael r davin sure suraj and as you the introduction in monalisa touch is a complete departure from our traditional business which is a cosmetic industry and so we are very excited to have this be our first fore into women health and that’s really what this about its womens health so if you just look at the opportunity that monalisa touch potentially could address which is really vaginal atrophy there is  million american women that are postmenopausal of which  or greater experience some form of vaginal atrophy and so the addressable market is very large but keep in mind there are a number of products on the market today estrogen replacement therapy other products like asaphena and other drugs out there that are providing a solution to women to address this indications so monalisa touch now falls from a device prospective into a category of an opportunity for physicians who use this device to treat vaginal atrophy so we are very early in the game were pleased not only with how the product is doing from a sales perspective but we are more importantly pleased with how well its doing from a clinical prospective and the satisfaction i mentioned earlier from the physicians and a patients is extremely high i guess the only caution i have out there is there is not a lot clinical data that’s been driven by united states physicians as it relates to using this technology to treat this indication and most of the data is coming out of europe although the data is very credible coming out of europe from very wellknown euro gynecologist in that country cynosure is very focused on driving clinical studies with us kols key opinion leaders to once again to demonstrate the validity of this technology from a clinical prospective so with a marathon amount of sprint the market is huge if you look at the number of gynecologists in the united states is well over  gynecologist although  of them work at hospital ad not private practices this is a private practice procedures so we have a complete business plan around this we are very focused on the longterm strategy we are very pleased of where we are but we really are nine months into the distribution and we will continue to give you color on the investments we are making to drive a clinical validation to continue to develop key opinion leaders weve placed a number of systems in academic institutions with high profile euro gynecologist and gynecologist to help us better to understand how broad is technology can really be and the treatment of this high volume indication for womens health so thats just where we are right now we will continue to keep you posted in the coming quarters suraj kalia okay and michael again for sculpsure admittedly its very early in the launch can you give us some color that the initial interest is it from accounts that are already strong in crude sculpt or is the initial interest from de novo greenfield accounts that are either have experience in some sort of hyperthermic device and its venturing out into noninvasive fat reduction michael r davin yes once again the market we believe is huge if you just look at north america as we said on the investor day we believe the core market of dermatologist and plastic surgeons which is  now there is less than  penetrated and then the noncore physician market which is almost  physicians with less than  penetrated if you look at cynosures performance over the last several years  of our revenue comes from the noncore market maybe look at our global installed base its almost  devices one of the advantageous we have is our ability to go directly to our very satisfied installed base and position this technology to them they know cynosure has an outstanding reputation of introducing safe and effective and clinically validated technology to them in the past for a variety of high line indications and they expect that exact same deliverable from cynosures to them with sculpsure so were leveraging all of that we are going directly after our installed base another thing most of that do not have another product because they have been waiting for cynosure to introduce a product some do have other products but are very intrigued by what hypothermic is going to bring to their practice so across the board a lot of interest in the technology we are thrilled to finally get this product rolling into the market we are very excited about q being our first full launch into the markets as we discussed earlier and we will keep you posted as things develop suraj kalia fair enough mike one question for you and one last question for tim ill hop back in queue so mike in q and forgive me if my numbers are a little off here ous revs as reported were down  yearoveryear if i remember correctly fx impact was negative  or so this quarter my math at least the reported ous revs are down  so fx it looks like had a negative  impact i guess the question i know it was asked earlier let me rephrase do you think we are at the point where ous is stabilizing for cynosure because if you keep putting up such strong us growth even if ous stabilizes the net impact on your pl is going to be pretty significant so can you give us some color whether we are definitively at that point where things are stabilizing ous michael r davin well i defer to tim on the numbers who threw out there because im not the expert there but assuming you are accurate with the numbers you have put out from an fx impact on the business looking ahead though i mentioned earlier not having control over the macro situations in these markets we do believe we are well positioned from an infrastructural standpoint from regulatory clearances that we not only receive but we will be receiving going forward our offices are well established in those markets for years  of our revenue comes from our direct offices where we have real control over the messaging and the distribution and our business strategy as you know in the past if you look at even  and  the majority of our revenue is coming out of our international offices so one of the beauties of being multinational and being diversified is you are going to have these ebbs and flows from a macro perspective where certain regions or continents are going to be stronger than others we are hopeful as we go into  that the overall macro environment gets better but we don’t have any control over that but we do know one thing we are going to continue to get registrations for products we are going to get sculpsure out into those markets next year and there are other opportunities to get registrations for products where we are direct that are going to drive new revenue opportunities that we don’t currently have but on the macro side as you know as well as i do we just have to see how things play out so they could have detriment on the business if we continue to see some of these fluctuations that we are seeing in currency or unrest that we just have no control over suraj kalia fair enough and tim one quick one i promise ill hop back in queue my apologizes i missed part of this i know there was commentary about us product revs being  of product sales can you help me reconcile the gross margin being relatively flat because obviously there is an impact from fx product mix so on and so forth if you could just give a little more granularity there would be greatly appreciated congrats again thanks for taking my questions scott solomon thank you timothy w baker sure as we mentioned yes product sales in north america is  of total laser product sales for the quarter  being international we did see an uptick of  basis points in our margin i think overall i think we would see stable pricing in the us markets we are currently seeing some pricing pressures in those international markets as you just went over with mike but overall we are seeing a positive trend in our margin each quarter we are seeing sequentially going up    basis points we think that will continue as again when we rollout these new products and as the international markets strengthen maybe one point back on the international is we are seeing  the nice part about our diversification strategy is that we obviously are in a number of international markets and we are seeing bright spot there too it’s not all dark internationally i mean our asia pac subsidiaries as well as our asia pac distributors showed good growth yearoveryear and actually for the quarter our middle east distributors for the quarter showed good growth yearoveryear so we do see some good pockets and some stabilization there are clearly some weak points particularly in europe or european subs and some direct european distributors but overall we are seeing some nice stabilization and bright spots in some of the other parts of the word scott solomon thank you operator our next question comes from a line of anthony vendetti with maxim please proceed with your question anthony v vendetti thanks so maybe just a follow up on that tim and then some broader question so gross margins as you said you going up  to  basis points do you expect that to continue is that due to pricing power that you have with the new products or just in terms of they are just higher margin product monalisa touch sculpsure picosure timothy w baker yes i think its all of the above i think its product mix and obviously brining a new products like monalisa like picosure even icon we are still getting very good pricing and icon is marked leading in product and as we introduce sculpsure we expect that to be a accretive to our margin clearly with the pacs coming into the play which will obviously accretive to our margin and the system itself will be accretive to our margin so we think we have a some nice catalysts out there in terms of product introductions and pricing of those products as well as back to international markets we are seeing some bright spots there which are recovering some pricing so based on that mix we expect to see that be incremental to our gross margin so we think we will continue to improve gross margin again we are doing a  to  basis points each quarter over the last three quarters so we expect that trend to continue anthony v vendetti okay and then just broadly on sculpsure i know in the introduction on your september  analyst day you talked about offering a discount for the pacs for the consumable piece as an initial promotion is that promotion through the end of the year and then what has been at least in the initial launch and i know its a soft launch right now or prelaunch what has been the asp for sculpsure on the system timothy w baker so in terms of the promotion on the pacs or the prepromotion in pac is  per applicator we are to your point anthony offering a  per applicator through the end of this year so that promotion will continue to the end of this year as it relate to asp we don’t obviously disclose asp but i will tell you is a number of customers are very excited about the promotion program we have a lot of impound interest and we are very pleased with the reception of this promotion program that we have offered and a lot of our existing customers are very excited about it and we are getting a lot of a good interests on it and we expect to see that to continue to the end of the year anthony v vendetti okay and then just mike i know we spent some time this year talking a lot about monalisa touch and i know its a new market for you and going to a lot of these different conferences i know the market is large but would you characterize the initial launches as better than internal expectations and just if you can give a little more color on monalisa touch pricing list asp and then i know like you said you don’t give out that product sales but is it in this quarter or at least through the year would you its exceed internal expectations michael r davin yes so monalisa touch as i mentioned we are to remind everybody just nine months into the launch of the product typical with cynosure launch a number of initiatives that we engage in from a marketing and distribution prospective those are in place and going well the list price on the box is a  typical of our north american sales force they are doing a great job in driving the value proposition of what this product offers the physician and so our asps are strong once again we don’t disclose asps but they are strong and we are very pleased with once again this being a new category for us so there is a kind of a shift in the mindset and how we market a product like this dealing directly with a gynecologist in a procedure that is more specific to their medical discipline than cosmetics and so there is a learning course its going very well and we want to continue to stay the course with our strategy which is a longterm approach to enter this market and to gain market share but more importantly as i mentioned physician and patients are thrilled with the results and that as you know is going to drive the momentum of this opportunity going forward anthony v vendetti okay and then just another question on sculpsure so fda approval i think  early fda approval which has been for several months now its caught everyone quite surprise at least it was earlier than i think maybe even you expected certainly than i expected and it seems like the full launch is first quarter  particularly in europe obviously you are taking orders now in the us is there any reason to believe that fourth quarter which is obviously the strongest quarter of the year wouldnt be a strong quarter in the us for sculpsure michael r davin antony as you know yes first of all we were very pleased with how quickly we received the fda clearance and it was well ahead of schedule and kudos to our regulatory team and our clinical team in driving that process but as i have mentioned several times we have always been on a parallel path with the introduction of sculpsure to the market from a development strategy as well as from a regulatory strategy so the development strategy is still on schedule and we have not alluded to international  the first full quarter really being international focus in terms of product revenue we are speaking about the full launch really being engaged in the first quarter of  so we saw some revenue in this quarter we definitely saw nice order flow this quarter weve made a distribution very aware and customers aware that we are still on the same production schedule with full ramp on production in q whether that’s us or whether that’s international so we are taking orders with the expectation of shipments really not ramping up until q anthony v vendetti okay and then and just lastly probably more of a tim question so organic revenue growth if we just look at organically i know there were some question in the beginning if we strip out some of royalties or one time payments or stuff like that if we just look at organic revenue growth whether its organic product revenue growth or total organic revenue growth what would be the right number for that tim timothy w baker yes i think you got to as look at our  define our business right our business is bringing in new technology brining new products and if we take out one timers like tria last year in q you take that out and our overall revenue growth was up  yearoveryear instead of the  as reported so you can take out those type of thing i mean i think in the end of day our business is about introducing new technologies and broadening our markets so there wasn’t really an acquisition ellman was really immaterial we had some ellman last year q which we disclosed in our filings last year it was about  million of revenue last year in ellman again that business is a nice business for us but it’s not a material business to our product line so i think if you look overall it is an organic growth rate right now when you look at our  because that’s our business and that’s the products that we are selling so i think you have to look at the business more holistically and again you can take out one timers like the tria which again obviously helps us to the  but we think overall that is our business anthony v vendetti okay and then just lastly tim on the difference between gaap and nongaap i don’t think there were any charges this quarter so the differences is the stock based comp or is there anything else in there timothy w baker no difference is amortization of the intangibles that we have every quarter since the palomore deal and the unrealized measurement gains and losses on fx so stock based comp is included in the numbers as we reported adjust anthony v vendetti okay but there were no charge no onetime charges timothy w baker no correct anthony v vendetti okay great alright thanks scott solomon thanks ant operator our next question comes from the line of zach ajzenman with griffin securities please proceed with your question zachary r ajzenman thanks good morning first question assuming the difficult environment in china would continue how long would it take picosure ramp to begin to nursely ph offset the weakness in that region michael r davin yes it is difficult question i don’t first of all to mind you and others say clearance we received for picosure in china was for the removal of tattoos we believe the broader opportunity in that market asia pac and china obviously included if the skin rejuvenation pigmented lesion market and so we are limited in terms of how we can position picosure to go after the higher volume indications in china which would be the nonpigmented lesions and skin rejuvenation we are in the process of driving that process for those clearances but we don’t have as of yet so we are somewhat limited with the tattoo removal clearance although with the clearance at least having the device cleared we are able to go after certain aspects of the market there more of the private sector market and position the technology for tattoo removal but physicians can also use the technology off label but we cannot market it as such so it will definitely be a stimulus for the chinese business but it’s not going to be as significant as the stimulus we will see once we get the skin rejuvenation clearances zachary r ajzenman okay got you one on sculpsure i don’t want to beat the dead horse but the sales and marketing as a percentage of sales this past quarter was a little light relative to the guidance provided at the investor day meeting were there personnel and marketing spend related to sculpsure that were pushed out or the company is pulling the range elsewhere michael r davin no i think zach we are pretty much right on we had shown as  on the kind of the overhead chart that we showed but we are talking about is a range of  to  and we came in at  so no just really rounding on the dollars no change no slowdown we did the marketing spend in q that we anticipated we hired  people related to sculpsure in the quarter as anticipated so i think everything rolled out as we talked about in september just rounded down at  versus  zachary r ajzenman okay got you and just a couple of more beginning in q of this year icon began to be specifically included in the prepared remarks of the driver what are some of the variables that to help us to better understand how or why it’s become notable one referencing healthy traction here in north america michael r davin yes icon if you go back from you acquired palomar one of the main interest from a product perspective of that acquisition was the icon platform which is also the starlux platform and slux ph platform so it’s had a legacy reputation and icon being the successor of really being a very versatile platform to treat a variety of cosmetic indications especially centered around skin rejuvenation because of its multiple delivery systems where we are seeing excellent traction of that product is in the noncore physician market that maybe for the first time wanting to acquire a technology for treatment of cosmetic procedures in their practice and they like the versatility of this platform where it allows them to treat a variety of cosmetic indication so its getting real good uptake in the noncore physician market which we’re also just seeing growth in naturally because of introduction of the affordable care act and once again reduction in insurance paid medicine fees to these physicians so overall its performing extremely well in the noncore physician market as we would have anticipated based on the unique nature of that platform and its versatility to treat a wide range of indications zachary r ajzenman got you and last one just on the capital structure  million of cash in equivalents or about  of the market cap can you update us on some of the most recent thoughts and views on how you guys are thinking about deploying that capital michael r davin yes you know in the past our main use of the cash has been stock buyback weve acquired our equity back and as tim mentioned we have a plan thats open right now with still  million in the balance and we will continue to review that opportunity at the board level and certainly buy our equity back at certain levels and then the other use of cash is spend in relationship to mergers and acquisitions as you know weve acquired four companies in the last four years were still very actively pursuing opportunities from an ma perspective and we will keep you posted as those things develop but thats really been the other use of our cash so to this point we dont see any changes as it relates to how we will use our cash zachary r ajzenman all right thanks guys michael r davin okay operator our next question comes from the line of jim sidoti with sidoti  company please proceed with your question james sidoti good morning can you hear me michael r davin yes jim timothy w baker hey jim james sidoti hey it’s been a long call but i just want one followup on that last question between monalisa sculpsure the rollout of picosure in china do you think you have enough on your plate right now that you can continue to grow at your historical rates without acquisitions or do you think you will continue to pursue acquisitions even though the new product pipeline is so right now michael r davin thats a great question jim and i would say my years of being here this is if not the most exciting one of the most exciting times in cynosure so it relates to our product portfolio the unique nature of our product portfolio and the opportunities that product portfolio provides to our global market in terms of our presence around the globe in terms how we are channeling this technology to go after a driving revenues so weve a lot going on and obviously sculpsure were very excited about the launch of that product and we believe the opportunity there is enormous so were going to stay very focused on the organic opportunities but as you know as we came out of the recession in  the strength of our balance sheet allowed us to acquire some very attractive technologies and to be able to channel those into our company and through our distribution and drive some of the growth that weve certainly been experiencing over the last couple of years and at a high level that’s still part of our strategy to continue to look at ma although we do believe our industry is fairly consolidated so we have a little different perspective now on maybe how we will use that cash and maybe entering into different verticals and different opportunities versus the traditional opportunities weve look at in the past but your point is valid and were very committed to staying focused on these multiple levers that we have to continue to drive the growth for cynosure and if the right opportunity comes along from a merger or from an acquisition perspective were ready in position to be able to make the move james sidoti all right thank you guys scott solomon you bet jim thanks operator our next question comes from the line of emmanuel de figueiredo with lbv asset management please proceed with your question emmanuel de figueiredo yes hello can i ask a question on china and hong kong and if you can give a bit of granularity on what you saw in q and what your people are telling you for the balance of the year michael r davin sure so what weve seen in china is more from the macro perspective is there has been a slowdown obviously in the growth of the economy there has been a devaluation of the currency which naturally i believe creates some anxiety amongst the consumer and therefore buying decisions are slowed down or all of our procedures are cash reimbursed and thats pretty much the case as well in china and so i just think there is an uneasiness right now on what is the long term outlook for the chinese economy and that will obviously put pause in places as it relates to peoples buying decisions whether its physicians or patients pulling back a little bit and being more conservative as it relates to the spending discretionary income for these types of procedures so i think allinall we’re still very bullish on the china market we opened our fourth office this year we’re excited about getting the pico clearance we’re excited about further expanding that product’s clearances going forward and we think that will be a great stimulus for growth in the china market we’re excited to get sculpsure approved into that market one of the other challenges of china today though is the regulatory process has been significantly increased in terms of the term it takes to get the product approved through the chinese fda so that will slow down a little bit the entry of new products for the market from a registration process but overall we’re still very bullish on china its just the macro environment has created a bit of a pause and a slowdown we believe in the buying decisions and also the appetite of the consumer to pursue cosmetic procedures so they better understand how the economy is going to play out in the future emmanuel de figueiredo but can you confirm that you are still experiencing constant currency growth there or its gone negative timothy w baker no we are seeing constant currency growth small numbers singledigits and obviously much less than we had seen over the last three or four years so growth is clearly slowing but we are still in a positive trend emmanuel de figueiredo great and just two followups on monalisa the first one is when do you think realistically  i mean at the moment you have a monopoly in this pathology but when do you think realistically one of your competitors will come with another laser and what sort of patent protection you have michael r davin yes actually we wouldn’t say its a monopoly there are competitive devices out there today there are three that i know of that are available on the market outside of monalisa touch and so i think the market is very large and similar to the noninvasive body contouring there is room for more than one player and our strategy we believe is one and which is maybe a little different in the way the others are approaching the opportunity and we are going to continue to drive that strategy and we are going to continue to invest in better understanding how this technology can have broader opportunities as it relates to addressing these very important women’s health indications but there is competition out there today and so we are up against that has as we speak emmanuel de figueiredo okay and my last one is on monalisa you have repeatedly said its only been nine months but looking into  would it be reasonable to assume that you could grow this  or you think thats completely off wrong i should be more conservative timothy w baker you should be more conservative emmanuel de figueiredo okay thank you scott solomon youre welcome operator our next question comes from the line of andy sobiech ph a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified analyst thank you im going to try to keep these real quick just a couple tim for you can you give us any estimate for the incremental cost in sales and marketing associated with sculpsure for q above the expense that was incurred in this quarter timothy w baker sure so at our investor presentation in september we laid out kind of what we saw as incremental cost for q q and q of  so in q we looked at about a million dollars of marketing spend plus about  in headcount hire and thats about where we came in for q we are anticipating additional  million in marketing with additional million dollars of headcount cost as we ramped up these people and then going into q we looked at  of headcount and  of direct marketing programs so  so we looked at it kind of over q q and q incremental spending of  million up and above our normal spend rates but as we mentioned earlier we expect to see that begin to leverage as early as q as we begin to roll some sculpsure shipments out the door unidentified analyst yes and that bring me to my second question for you the systems that were place with luminaries those were basically evaluation units i understand maybe a half of dozen or so did any of those convert to revenue or will they convert to a purchase in the current quarter michael davin yes andy its michael typical whenever we launch a new product its very common for us to seed luminaries and i could say those were not for revenue but they are in exchange for indiscernible equity mainly driving clinical studies for us to further expand the clinical validation as a platform some research projects that we are working on right now to look at additional indication also we place units for training and for educational purposes so the devices that are out there as it relates to that category of luminaries there was no revenue recorded there was no revenue generated from those units unidentified analyst thank you for clarifying that im going to pass it along it’s been a long call operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the floor back over to mr davin for closing comments michael r davin thank you operator thank you for joining us this morning we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress have a great day
