affiliationshaitian luyi tanemail authorhong huangarticlefirst online  august   citations  downloads abstractthis paper is a theory development to amit brander and zott  journal of business venturing   on the nature of venture capital firms in their paper the authors argue that venture capital firms exist because they fill a market niche by developing the ability to overcome extreme information asymmetry embedded in highrisk entrepreneurial firms however this theory encounters difficulties in explaining a variety of organizational and behavioral divides among venture capitalists in different contexts and over time in this paper we apply the institutionbased view to reveal the nature of venture capital we argue that it is the venture capitalists’ capability to capture economic rents from the institutional environment that distinguish them from other financial intermediaries we show the connection of our perspective with the conventional view as well as the usefulness of this theory in explaining the development of the venture capital industry in chinakeywordsventure capital institutions rentseeking strategy china the authors wish to thank dr seunghyun lee and the two anonymous

under  usc §e of us provisional application ser no  entitled “systems and methods for enabling remote device users to wager on micro events of games in a data network accessible gaming environment” which was filed on nov   and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety technical held embodiments are generally related to sports and event betting including parimutuel and nonparimutuel betting embodiments are also related to online gaming embodiments are additionally related to systems and methods that allow users utilizing remote devices to wager on micro events of any type in a data network accessible gaming environment facilitated by one or more network servers background of the invention betting on sports and other events is a multibillion dollar business casinos for example have large sports and event betting parlors for attracting bettors these parlors display the bets that a person may make on various sporting or types of events bets are placed on most major sports including professional and college football soccer baseball basketball auto racing and ice hockey as well as cricket and rugby further bets are placed on various sports tournaments including the ncaa mens and womens basketball championships and world cup soccer also bets may be placed on other types of events including a selection of the winner of a reality television show eg the survivor reality show election results weather events when the first person lands on mars the winner of the next united states presidential election or any other type of event in general gambling is the wagering or betting of money or something of material value referred to as “the stakes” on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional money andor material goods typically the outcome of the wager or bet is evident within a short period the term “gaming” in this context typically refers to instances in which the activity has been specifically permitted by law the two words are not mutually exclusive ie a “gaming” company offers legal “gambling” activities to the public this distinction is not universally observed in the englishspeaking world however for instance in the uk the regulator of gambling activities is called the gambling commission not the gaming commission also the word gaming is frequently used to describe activities that do not involve wagering especially online while almost any game can be played for money and any game typically played for money can also be played just for fun some games are generally offered in a casino setting gaming can also be accomplished for nonmonetary prizes such as coupons “points” that can be redeemed for merchandise or discounts and other promotional or recreational purposes fixed odds betting and parimutuel betting frequently occur at many types of sporting events and political elections in addition many bookmakers offer fixed odds on a number of nonsports related outcomes for example the direction and extent of movement of various financial indices the winner of television competitions such as big brother and election results interactive prediction markets also offer trading on these outcomes with “shares” of results trading on an open market one of the most widespread forms of gambling involves betting on horse or greyhound racing wagering may take place through parimutuel pools nonparimutuel betting arrangements or bookmakers may take bets personally parimutuel wagers for example pay off at prices determined by support in the wagering pools while bookmakers pay off either at the odds offered at the time of accepting the bet or at the median odds offered by track bookmakers at the time the race started parimutuel betting from the french language pari mutuel or mutual betting is a betting system in which all bets of a particular type are placed together in a pool taxes and a house “take” or “vig” are removed by the gaming sponsor or organizer and payoff odds are calculated by sharing the pool among all winning bets in some countries it is known as the tote after the totalisator which calculates and displays bets already made parimutuel andor nonparimutuel betting systems are utilized in gambling events such as horse racing greyhound racing jai alai etc and most sporting events of relatively short duration in which participants finish in a ranked order a modified parimutuel system has also been adapted for use in some lottery games betting on team sports has become an important service industry in many countries for example millions of britons play the football pools every week in addition to organized sports betting both legal and illegal there are many sidebetting games played by casual groups of spectators such as ncaa basketball tournament bracket pools super bowl squares fantasy sports leagues with monetary entry fees and winnings and inperson spectator games like moundball arbitrage betting is a theoretically riskfree betting system in which every outcome of an event is bet upon so that a known profit will be made by the bettor upon completion of the event regardless of the outcome arbitrage betting is a combination of the ancient art of arbitrage trading and gambling which has been made possible by the large numbers of bookmakers in the marketplace creating occasional opportunities for arbitrage one can also bet with another person that a statement is true or false or that a specified event will happen a “back bet” or will not happen a “lay bet” within a specified time this occurs in particular when two people have opposing but strongly held views on truth or events not only do the parties hope to gain from the bet they place the bet also to demonstrate their certainty about the issue some means of determining the issue at stake must exist sometimes the amount bet remains nominal demonstrating the outcome as one of principle rather than of financial importance a multiplayer video game is one within which more than one person can play in the same game environment at the same time unlike most other games computer and video games are often singleplayer activities that pit the player against preprogrammed challenges andor ai artificial intelligencecontrolled opponents which often lack the flexibility and ingenuity of regular human thinking multiplayer components allow players to enjoy interaction with other individuals be it in the form of partnership competition or rivalry and provide them with a form of social communication that is almost always missing in singleplayer oriented games in a variety of different multiplayer game types players may individually compete against two or more human contestants work cooperatively with a human partners in order to achieve a common goal supervise activities of other players or engage in a game type that incorporates any possible combination of the above multiplayer games typically require the players to share resources of a single game system or use networking technologies that allow players to play together over greater distances brief summary the following summary is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the disclosed embodiment and is not intended to be a full description a full appreciation of the various aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein can be gained by taking the entire specification claims drawings and abstract as a whole it is therefore one aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide systems and methods that allow users of remote communication

competitive entertainment event occurring in a gaming environment via access to a network server over a data network it is still a further aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide for a method for microbetting including identifying a microoutcome to an event or series of events occurring during a macro event such as a football game utilizing a display associated with a remote device selecting the microoutcome within the larger macro event utilizing a user interface associated with the remote device and placing a microbet on the microoutcome within the macroevent at a server through a data network utilizing the remote device a microoutcome is an outcome other than the final result of the macroevent that occurs during the macroevent but can be indisputably calculated either before or after the final result of the macroevent an example of a microoutcome would be the results of a play within a game with a statistically tracked outcome such as a pitch to a batter in a baseball game strike ball hit by pitch hit single double triple home run error fielders choice etc a batters completed atbat during a baseball game hit flyout groundout hit by pitch error strike out foul out etc or a fielders participation in a play put out or error a microoutcome would be the subject of a microbet some microoutcomes can be cumulative microoutcomes such as how many interceptions a quarterback will throw in a quarter a half or the entire game how many rushing yards eg − a running back will achieve in a defined period or the entire game or even whether a candidate will win particular precincts within a congressional district and by how many votes to be a microoutcome the outcome must be less than the final complete outcome of the event and verifiable by an official statistic kept by a third party not participating in the betting itself it is yet another aspect of the disclose embodiments to provide a method for microbetting including identifying a microevent with multiple potential microoutcomes occurring during a sporting event utilizing a display integrated within a portable wireless handheld device selecting the microevent utilizing a user interface associated with the portable wireless handheld device and placing a microbet on the outcome of the microevent at a server through a data network utilizing the portable wireless handheld device it is also an aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide a system for betting on microoutcomes occurring during a macroevent and microoutcomes of the macroevents such a system can include a server for brokering wagers on microevents occurring during macroevents and at least one remote device in communication with the server requesting placement of wagers on microevents occurring during a macroevent it is another aspect of the disclosed embodiments that remote devices include desktop computers laptop computers settop boxes internetenabled high definition televisions sets hdtvs and portable wireless handheld devices such as smartphones pdas personal digital assistants and proprietary portable devices rented to users at a venue it is still another aspect of the disclosed embodiments that

computing device fig  illustrates a highlevel flow chart of operations depicting logical operational steps of a method  for enabling one or more remote device users to wager on games in a data network access to a gaming environment in accordance with the disclosed embodiments as indicated at block  an operation can be implemented to identify a microevent with an event utilizing a remote computing device such as for example the remote computingcommunications device  depicted in fig  once the microevent has been identified then the microevent eg a player swinging a bat in the context of a particular inning of a baseball game can be selected utilizing such a remote computing device as described at block  thereafter as illustrated at block  a microbet ie a wager bet etc can be placed with respect to the micro event through a network such as network  utilizing the remote computing device  data indicative of the microbet is transmitted from the remote computing device  for placement of the microbet via one or more servers eg server   etc in communication with the network  in general the method  depicted in fig  allows a user of the remote computing device  to wager on one or more microoutcomes discreet and cumulative that result from the conduct of a macroevent via access to network servers  andor  etc over the data network  fig  illustrates a highlevel flow chart of operations depicting a method  for authentication of a user of a remote computing device in accordance with the disclosed embodiments as illustrated at block  a secure identification can be established to permit a user of the remote computing device  access to one or more of the servers   etc through the network  via the authentication module  next as depicted at block  the userauthorized party is provided with secure and remote access to one or more of the servers   etc for placing bets via the remote computing device  the user of the remote computing device  can then actually enter his or her secure identification via the remote computing device  as described at block  remote access can then be granted to the user if his or her identification information is confirmed as depicted at block  remote access can to one or more of the servers   etc via the network  include for example access to statistics and event data as indicated at block  such information can be utilized by the user in consideration for placing his or her microbet with respect to a microevent via the remote computing device  note that although betswagers can be placed by remote device users on the outcome of a macroevent anytime before or during but before the conclusion of a macroevent the users are not able to bet on microevents outcomes or cumulative microoutcomes occurring during and within the macroevent the disclosed embodiments thus provide systems and methods for enabling of microbetting microevents with microoutcomes can occur several or more times for example during an overall sporting macroevent or game or be calculated at the conclusion of segments of the macro event eg quarters halves etc or the entire macro event for example each swing of a baseball bat by a baseball player in a professional baseball game is a microevent that can itself be a part of or contribute to a microoutcome the microoutcome in such a case is the result of the pitch or the overall at bat a wager can be whether the pitch is a strike a ball or a walk this might be the smallest possible microoutcome at that moment in the macroevent another type of microoutcome that is larger than the outcome of a single pitch within the macroevent baseball game would be whether the player currently at bat for example walks strikes out is hit by a pitch flies out grounds out hits a single double triple home run or inside the park home run reaches on a fielders choice or reaches on an error a microoutcome bet could even be placed that not only will the batter ground out but that he will ground out to a particular fielder utilizing the approach described herein microbets in baseball can be placed for example on cumulative microevents such as how many errors a team will commit in a game how many hits the team will have how many pitchers they will use etc the only limitation would be that the microbet would have to be verifiable by reference to the macroevents official statistics so that the dispute of a microoutcome would have a neutral reference point in an election macroevent for example the microoutcomes eligible for microbets might be on the winner in an individual precinct state or other counted and reported area the margin of victory etc odds can be assigned to each of these potential outcomes either on a parimutuel or some other basis such as historical averages bets placed on a microevent can be against the house or can be against other players participating in a social microgaming environment hosted by a server the following nonlimiting scenarios provide examples of microevents a number of scenarios are possible and any macroevent or series of events with official statistics tracking microoutcomes within the macroevent are eligible for this system of gaming in one scenario for example person x watches a football game in real time utilizing a remote computing device  and places a bet that the quarterback on football team a will throw microoutcome on the next play the odds are given on the display based on parimutuel calculations based upon the microbetting positions of other similarly situated users the displayed odds are  person x bets  and the quarterback does not attempt a pass person xs account is debited  and the balance in his account remains available to place another microbet on any microevent or microoutcome that may follow person x then places a microbet that on the next play team a will suffer an interception because of the microbetting positions of other users the odds of this outcome are displayed as  these actions continue throughout the game until the end of the macroevent game or person xs account is empty of available betting funds microbetting allows person x to take positions counter to prior bets betting a quarterback will throw  touchdown passes in one cumulative microbet and in another microbetting he throws none bet repeatedly on discreet microevents outcomes within the game and continuously “play” the macroevent with the participants through microbetting both in real time or on microoutcomes tracked by official statistics eg how many catches a receiver will have in a game how many penalties a team will suffer how many rushing yards a back will gain etc this level of participation means the player does not have to wait for long periods to track hisher progress in the event in another scenario for example person y places a bet utilizing remote computing device  on a particular player during a baseball game for example person y places a bet that a batter from team a hits a home run during the game a cumulative microbet however person y notices that the batter from team b is playing well person y is allowed to also place a bet on a batter from team b since it has become obvious that during the game that particular batter is playing well and may score a home run as long as the game is continuing and the odds are being updated the microbets remain available another bet during a baseball game would be if person y places a bet on how many runs will be scored before each particular inning or even in each inning during the game person y is able to place multiple bets that do not rely on the overall score of the game but components of the game such as a players performance eg hits runs rbi errors etc in yet another scenario for example during a basketball game person x places a bet via the remote computing device  on the amount of points a particular player will score a cumulative microbet as the game progresses person x can place bets on other players in addition to a players performance person x can place a bet on the score of the game or developments in the game in general whether a coach will receive a technical foul in still another scenario for example during a game of golf person y places a bet on golfer a who is predicted to win the tournament however on the very first hole golfer a hits a triple bogey as a result person y decides to place a microbet that golfer a will hit a shot out of bounds or that golfer a will miss a ′ putt throughout the particular game in which bets are being placed microbetting via the remote computing device  allows the gambler to feel as if theyre “in the game” and even after losing early bets can win their money back by placing different subsequent bets fig  illustrates a block diagram of a wagering system  that includes the commitments or exchange of credits coupons or electronic cash for a microbet in accordance with the disclosed embodiments as indicated in fig  the remote computing device  can communicate with network  which can also communicate with a coupon source  thus the computing device  can retrieve and store electronic coupons for use in wagering and placing microbets as disclosed herein note that the coupon source  can be configured as a web site from which coupon and credit data may be retrieved such a web site can be associated with a transaction broker  andor a thirdparty provider  andor a wagering manager  note that the wagering manager  can be associated with or include the use of a coupon manager  and a credit manager  a security module  permits access andor communications to the wagering manager  similarly a security module  permits access andor communications with the thirdparty provider  which in turn can communicate with a provider database  a security module  can communicate with a transaction broker  that in turn includes or is associated with a user profile database  referring to fig  a video display screen  is shown integrated within a remote device  ideally the video display screen  can support the viewing of a macroevent activity  as well as micro event gaming data  on the video display screen  the video display screen can also be touchsensitive to provide a touch screen interface for users to place bets when the remote device is a handheld device with large screens associated with remote devices  macroevent video can be shown simultaneously with microbet wagering data such as tallies histories and pending microbets as an example a pictureinpicture display can enable simultaneous viewing of disparate data macroevent video and wagering data it is an aspect of the disclosed invention that a video display on the remote device provide wagering data and input fields accessible by a remote device user and a user interface on the remote device enable user interaction with wagering input fields by a remote device user fig  illustrates a highlevel flow chart of operations depicting a method  for wagering in accordance with the disclosed embodiments as illustrated at block  an operation can be implemented in which a macroevent such as a sporting event is analyzed and microevents within the macroevent are analyzed for potential microbets note that a microevent can be an event as “small” as for example the next pitch in a baseball game ie the macroevent is a strike or a ball ie the microoutcome the player in a basketball game ie the macroevent makes a free throw ie the microoutcome the next play in a football game ie the macroevent is a pass or run ie the microoutcome or an individual participant reaches certain cumulative microoutcomes eg yards gained passes completed hits points etc in a set period during or at the end of the entire macroevent eg baseball game football game etc following processing of the operation depicted at block  potential microbets eg an individual bet or a group of bets on one or more microoutcomes can be determined and each microbet is associated with a particular microoutcome within the macroevent or with for example the cumulative performance of one or more participants in the macroevent or segments of the macroevent thereafter as described at block  the odds can be calculated with respect to each of the potential microbets determined ie from block  next as depicted at block  the microoutcome andor the microevents can be displayed eg a live video feed video replay etc via a display such as for example the video display screen  shown in fig  the user interface  etc as indicated at block  the microbets eg a series of potential microbets can also be displayed via such a display and in association with such video of the macroevent andor including the particular microevents discreet andor cumulative associated with respective microbets additionally as illustrated at block  for each microbet particular odds based on a set amount can be displayed via a display such as the display screen  the user interface  etc next as indicated at block  a particular microbet andor multiple microbets can be selected via for example a user interface such as for example the user interface  thereafter as depicted at block  a test can be processed to determine if a selection of a microbet or a group of microbets has been made if so then as indicated at block  the microbets can be automatically entered and processed via for example a server eg server  server  etc and results then generated if it is determined however that a selection has not been made then as indicated at block  additional or alternative choices eg othernew microbets associated with particular microoutcomes can be offered for selection based on the foregoing it is clear that a microoutcome can result using discreet verifiable actions as small as whether the next pitch in a baseball game is a strike or ball the player in a basketball game makes the free throw the next play in a football game is a pass or run the next play in a football game gains more or less than  yards results in a fumble interception or penalty etc also the user can be presented with a display via display screen of multiple choices of microbets each of which displays the odds if he or she wins for example in a football game macroevent the display screen  can display the game eg video and above that video a series of potential microbets eg pass run turnover touchdown gain  gain less than  lose yards sack etc for each potential microbet the user can view his or her odds if the user bets  for example or some other set amount for instance it might be  to  that an interception will be thrown but  to  if it will be a running play the user can “click” ie select the microbet or multiple microbets he or she desires and as long as this bet is entered in the server eg server  server  etc before the play is displayed the user is “in the action” so to speak if the player does not like any of those bets he or she can click or hit a graphically displayed button displayed via the display screen and be given additional choices the priority of available microbets can be established in several ways including prioritizing based on the popularity of the bets with the current participants the lowest or highest odds prioritized the participants history or customized to the participants preferences the disclosed embodiments thus relate to methods and systems for providing microbet options for each microevent and a running tally thereof for example each play in a game provides an opportunity for a new set of microbetting choices the disclose embodiments are thus not focused on the concept of the user betting prior to the macroevent that a particular player will achieve some result eg hit a home run during the game but rather allows a user at any time during the game and prior to the microoutcome that the microoutcome will occur in addition the user can place a microbet that the batter currently up to the plate will hit a home run or a triple or a double or a single or walk or get hit by a pitch or reach on a passed ball or fly out or ground out these real time microbets are available with real time parimutuel or nonparimutuel odds as an at bat is a microevent that will result in a microoutcome that is objectively verifiable by reference to statistics kept by a neutral third party the user literally can place for example hundreds of verifiable bets on microoutcomes during a macroevent via such an approach there are already bets that can be placed before an event starts on game scores scores after quarters halftime scores scores after a certain number of innings etc there are already bets available on whether for example a particular baseball player will hit a home run in a game there are no bets available however where even after a macroevent starts a particular baseball player will hit a home run much less a system where a bet can be placed in real time on whether a certain microoutcome will occur during a specific at bat or even a particular pitch this is a key difference between the disclosed embodiments and prior art implementations the disclosed embodiments thus provide for a “betplay as you watch dynamic parimutuel or nonparimutuel game” where each possible situation or microevent in a larger game enables multiple betting options on microevent outcomes even after the macroevent starts such an approach is outlined herein with respect to fig  fig  illustrates a highlevel flow chart of operations depicting a method  for placing a microbet with respect to multiple betting options eg parimutuel andor nonparimutuel in accordance with the disclosed embodiments the operations indicated in fig  thus relate to a method  for microbetting as illustrated at block  an operation can be implemented for displaying video one or more macroevents via a display screen associated with andor integrated with a remote computing device such as for example the remote computing device  discussed earlier herein thereafter as indicated at block  an operation can be implemented for identifying one or more microevent within the macroevent or macroevents displayed via a display screen of for example the remote computing device  next as depicted at block  an operation can be implemented for generating multiple and parimutuel betting options with respect to varying microoutcomes within the identified macroevent or macroevents note that although the discussion herein refers to “parimutuel betting” it can be appreciated that nonparimutuel betting options can be implemented in accordance with alternative embodiments thereafter as described at block  an operation can be implemented for placing via the remote computing device one or more microbets among the multiple and parimutuel or nonparimutuel betting options with respect to the microoutcomes descrete and cumulative via a data network in communication with the remote computing device then as depicted at block  the microbet or microbets can be transmitted from the remote computing device for placement via one or more servers eg servers   etc in communication with the network thereafter as illustrated at block  an operation can be implemented for displaying the data indicative of the multiple and parimutuel or nonparimutuel betting options via the display screen of the remote computing device in association with the video of the macroevent or macroevents displayed via the display screen fig  illustrates a highlevel flow chart of operations depicting a method  for configuring a control function  see figs  for setting microbets in accordance with the disclosed embodiments fig  illustrates a block diagram of the control function  for setting microbets in accordance with the disclosed embodiments note that as indicated in fig  particular submodules software modules are shown with respect to the control function  which is also preferably implemented as a software module these submodules include for example a module  for setting when a microbetting opportunity begins and a module  for designating when a microbetting opportunity ends module  can “reset” a microbetting opportunity as discussed further herein and modules  and  respectively implement parimutuel or standard eg nonparimutuel betting it can be appreciated of course that other types of submodules may be utilized in the context of control function  to provide other control functionalities fig  illustrates a block diagram of application programs  including control function  in accordance with the disclosed embodiments note that in a preferred embodiment the application programs  shown in fig  can include for example the control function  module along with the modules    etc as shown in fig  as indicated at block  in fig  the overall process of method  begins then as indicated at block  the control function  eg a software module andor a hardware module can be established and then as illustrated at block  the control function  can be configured to set when a microbetting opportunity begins eg module  in fig  similarly as depicted at block  the control function  can be configured to set when the microbetting opportunity ends eg module  in fig  next as illustrated at block  the control function  can be configured to include a reset operation eg module  in fig  then as illustrated at block  the control function  can be configured to include selection of a betting type including for example parimutuel or standard betting operations eg modules   in fig  for a microbet to take place the control function  or control mechanism can be utilized to designate when a microbetting opportunity begins and ends for example if one is betting in baseball on the outcome of a pitch there has to be some way for the better to know when he or she can place the bet and when the bet is no longer available one possible solution involves having a person controlling the availability of the betting by hitting a “reset” so that the current series of microbets are “set” and no more bets can be placed this could involve an active human controller utilizing a control mechanism such as the control function  in the aforementioned baseball example there would be a series of bets offered for a certain situation such as an at bat the series of bets would be for example “hit ball strike error hit by pitch wild pitch passed ball foul ball foul out ground out fly out bunt pickoff attempt pickoff or walk” these betting options can be displayed on a display screen and become available for selection via a “reset” by the human controller when the pitcher becomes available for example the human controller can “hit” or select a graphically displayed “set” button thereby freezing all bets the outcome of that pitch microevent occurs and a reset button can be hit allowing the next set of microbets to become available for this type of microbetting eg what happens in an individual at bat on a per pitch basis the action does not need to be parimutuel though it can hence as indicated in block  of fig  various types of betting schemes eg parimutuel nonparimutuelstandard etc can be available the particular type of event prediction can be accomplished by for example simply utilizing odds calculations and the house can therefore take the risk that someone gets lucky the pricing of the bets can just be set via the control mechanism  so the odds are that in the long run for example the house will win such features would find particularly useful application in the context of for example a casino sports book a sports book manager or sports book personnel can for example sit in a sports book booth and control the availability of microbetting on a game being televised in the sports book and the gamblers sit there and bet on every play as they watch in some situations “little” booths may be in the sports book where a better can watch a game and on a screen next to it microbets are constantly made available with respect to that game the gambler or user thus watches on one screen and bets on the other fig  illustrates a block diagram of a multiple display screen system  which can be utilized for placing microbets in accordance with the disclosed embodiments the multiple display screen system  can be implemented as a device or system which contains two display screens or display areas such as displays  and  display screen  can display a microbetting gui  and display screen  can display live video or nonlive video of a macroevent or multiple macroevents note that although two display areas  and  are shown in fig  and together form a dual display screen system it can be appreciated that multiple display screens may be implemented in accordance with alternative embodiments it may be a violation of nfl and other sports copyrights to have the bets literally overlayed on the same screen as the available microbets to overcome this possibility the multiple graphic display system  can be implemented to provide for a graphic display of the bets that are synchronized to the televised game but not on the same screen such a system can enable a better to watch the game on his or her television or computer and then on another screen either a picture in picture dual windows or two different devices and have his or her microbetting opportunities appear for selection one day the sporting leagues might allow microbetting as an overlay but until they do the system  can be implemented which allows the microbetting gui  to be simply synchronized to the macroevent itself so people can bet while just listening and synchronized to the video of the macroevent but does not have to appear on the same screen fig  illustrates a highlevel flow chart of operations depicting logical operational steps of a method  for online competition and microbets thereof in accordance with a the disclosed embodiments note that as utilized herein the term “online” generally refers to being connected to a computer network or accessible by computer such as for example an “online database” or an “online community” or an “online social network” method  and systems thereof allow a group of people to play one another online for a “pot” as in for example video porker in the “real world” six eight or ten people can sit at a poker table and gamble with one another utilizing the approach of method  and systems thereof a set number of people can select to meet with one another online to compete on a macroevent using the microbetting approach described herein for example suppose that eight dallas cowboys fans would meet online to microbet while watching the cowboys play the redskins the participants can pick a controller set or rotating among them under some rule scheme pick the microbets they wanted to make available for all or part of the session perhaps allowing the rotating controller to pick the microbets to be made available and then play one another until some set endpoint the endpoint can be for example when one person wins all of a preset pot when the macroevent is over or some other criteria to determine an end this again would be appropriate for building an online community for a casino sports book or the betters can enter a “controlled” game where the “house” is the controller and all of the players simply played the house or the house controlled and took a vie on each round of bets in exchange of performing the controlling function for the participants note that the term “house” in this context refers generally to the management of a gambling house or casino thus as indicate at block  the process of method  begins next as depicted at block  an operation can be implemented in which a particular number of players is allowed to meet online with one another examples of online meetings include those offered by internet social networks and so forth thereafter as illustrated at block  an operation can be implemented to select a particular macroevent for microbetting via the microbetting approach disclosed herein next as described at block  the participants in the online meeting can select a controller eg a human controller of the control function  described earlier andor control functions eg control functions offered by the control function  next as depicted at block  an operation can be implemented to select microbets to be made available for microbetting next as illustrated at block  one or more microbets can be made online by one or more of the participants during the online game or competition until the endpoint described earlier it will be understood that the circuits and other means supported by each block and combinations of blocks can be implemented by special purpose hardware software or firmware operating on special or generalpurpose data processors or combinations thereof it should also be noted that in some alternative implementations the operations noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the figures for example two blocks shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order an option can be introduced to prevent cheating with respect to the disclosed embodiments such an option involves randomizing or somewhat randomizing available microbets for example in the context of an interactive casino sports book a number of terminals may be available for microbetters to sit and watch the microevent eg a cowboys vs redskins football game in such a situation the casino controller can hit “reset” after every microevent to lock in the results of the prior microbets and also bring up a choice of new microbets the controller however would have a choice of what microbets to offer the betters the choice could be for example a set of defensive bets eg tackle for loss sack interception fumble blocked kick etc or offensive bets eg run pass touchdown etc or neutral bets eg penalty time out injury stoppage etc to keep a player eg tony romo from cheating with a microbetter eg knowing he is going to pass on the rd play the controller—either a person or a computer—can randomly change the selections of what microbets are available from play to play or even do so nonrandomly such as when the situation is rd and  make sure the microbets available are different from the last time the situation was third and  thus by changing the microbets available in a manner that the players and betters would not be able to predict takes almost any chance of cheating out of the game it will be appreciated that variations of the abovedisclosed and other features and functions or alternatives thereof may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications for example it can be appreciated that the betting approach disclosed herein does not have to be parimutuel but can also be implemented as betting in which odds are set by a controller eg sort of “house odds” that is “parimutuel” is just one particular betting approach but not the only betting system or approach that can be utilized in accordance with the disclosed embodiments also that various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives modifications variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those

  us pat no  issued mar   the disclosures of which are incorporate herein by reference background of the invention  field of the invention the invention relates to systems for creating catalogs of goods and services over a communications network more specifically the invention is directed to a method and system for aggregating content for an online catalog system  description of the related art the internet is a worldwide network of computers linked together by various hardware communication links all running a standard suite of protocols known as tcpip transmission control protocolinternet protocol the growth of the internet over the last decade has been explosive fueled in the most part by the widespread use of software viewers known as browsers and http hypertext transfer protocol which allow a simple gui graphical user interface to be used to communicate over the internet browsers generally reside on the computer used to access content on the internet ie the client computer http is a component of tcpip and provides users access to files of various formats using a standard page description language known as html hypertext markup language and more recently xml extensible markup language and xhtml extensible hypertext markup language a reformulation of html into xml the collection of servers on the internet using http has become known as the “world wide web” or simply the “web” as known and appreciated in the art there are presently millions of web pages with various content tools have been developed to allow the user to search these web pages to obtain the various web pages having the various content of interest one way to locate the desired web pages is to use a “search engine” which will search for web pages having a particular keyword or key words search engines typically have three components a crawler such as a robot bot or automated site searcher an index and a software program which presents the results of the search to the user the crawler automatically “crawls” from web server to web server and the sites hosted therein to gather urls and other information such as the text of the page that the search engine can use in the searches for keywords when the information gathering by the crawler is completed the information regarding the web pages is stored in the search engines databases and indexed when a user seeking information from the web types in a keywords in a search field of the search engine the search engines software program then utilizes algorithmic functions and criteria to find keyword matches in the information stored in the databases some programs search all of the text of each page while other programs merely search the urls andor titles of the pages the software program then sorts through the results of the search and provides a prioritized results to the user based on relevancy of the web page various search engine software programs differ in their methods used for determining a web pages relevancy for example the software may view the “meta tag” of the page include a counter for counting the number of keyword occurrences on the text of the page andor consider the web pages popularity as well as other factors such as whether the webmaster of the web page has made special arrangements to have the web page displayed as a result of the search one of the primary applications of the web has been shopping ie the purchase of goods and services ie products virtually every major commercial “bricks and mortar” merchant has established a web site for the showcase and sale of their products further many manufacturers sell products directly over the web finally a plethora of online merchants not previously existing in the bricks and mortar world have come into existence as a result virtually every product is available for purchase over the web from a plurality of merchants this situation has increased the efficiency of markets by permitting shoppers to readily compare products and terms of sale from plural merchants without the need to travel physically to the merchant locations however in order to compare products and terms of different merchants one must “visit” the various merchant web sites individually first this requires knowledge of the urls for each merchant web site or the use of a search engine which can be cumbersome and inaccurate it is possible to open the various sites in different browser windows for better comparison however the various formats of each merchant web site render it tedious to compare products and terms directly when a purchase decision is made the purchase or purchases must be made through the individual merchant web sites further ordinarily the shopper is required to log in to each merchant web site by entering a username and password for example prior to making a purchase and then proceed to the next site for example if the shopper decides to buy three items from three different merchants three log in procedures and three buy procedures ie procedures for effecting a purchase on the merchant web sites must be manually executed respectively through the three merchant web sites and their proprietary interfaces it is well known to integrate a plurality of web sites into a single environment known as a “shopping portal” shopping portals ordinarily include a web server presenting an integrated interface displaying plural products from various merchants accordingly conventional shopping portals facilitate comparison shopping and thus increase market efficiency in order to provide an integrated shopping experience it is known to prepare a catalog of product offerings from various merchants organized in a taxonomy of product categories however since various merchants and other parties having product information records all store information in various data formats and layouts collection of information for a product catalog is a tedious and labor intensive task requiring a great deal of manual operations summary of the invention an aspect of the invention is a method of creating a product catalog stored on computer readable media by aggregating product information from a plurality of product information sources having disparate formats for product information and storing the information in a taxonomy the method comprises processing plural product information records from the product information sources into one or more groups based on which product information records are likely to correspond to the same product correlating a unique product id corresponding to the product associated with each of said groups to identify the product comparing each identified product to categories of a taxonomy to determine a category for the identified products in the taxonomy and determining attributes for each categorized product based on the product information records corresponding to each group creating product specifications based on the determined attributes and storing the product specification in the corresponding determined categories of the taxonomy brief description of the drawing the invention is described through a preferred embodiment and the attached drawings in which fig  is a block diagram of a computer architecture in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention including a plurality of manufacturers servers fig  is a block diagram of a portion of the architecture of fig  schematically illustrating the communication channel connections for an automated purchase procedure fig  is a block diagram of the cookie handling procedure of the preferred embodiment fig  is a schematic representation of the internal automated purchase procedure of the shopping server of the preferred embodiment fig  is a block diagram of a method in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention for processing the gathered product property information from the plurality of manufacturers servers fig  is a block diagram of a method in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention for validating the product offerings of online merchants and for creating a new product record based on the determined product properties fig  is a schematic illustration of a catalog taxonomy of the preferred embodiment fig  is a schematic illustration of a property definition tool of another preferred embodiment and fig  is a flowchart of the operation of the property definition tool of fig  detailed description of the preferred embodiment a preferred embodiment of a computer architecture for providing an integrated online shopping experience and product catalog generation is illustrated in fig  commerce system  includes client computer  executing browser application  that supports the http protocol client computer  is connected typically through an isp internet service provider to internet  serving as a communication channel for example client computer system  can be coupled to the isp via a conventional dial up connection using a modem or through a broadband connection such as isdn integrated services digital network a cable modem or a dsl digital subscriber line connection shopping server  is also coupled to internet  in a known manner shopping server  executes a web server control application  known as an http server application stored in a memory device for example public domain web server software applications from ncsa or apache can be used shopping server  also executes agent server control application  the function of which is described in detail below utilizing a secure connection for privacy a plurality of merchant servers  provide online shopping using conventional commerce server control applications ie software that runs some of the main functions of an online storefront such as product display online ordering and inventory management merchant servers  and commerce server software are well known and thus are not described in detail herein further merchant servers  can store product information records including information about product offerings in the preferred embodiment each of client computer  shopping server  and merchant servers  are capable of communicating using a secure connection protocol such as ssl or shttp for clarity non secure connections  and secure connections  are illustrated separately however typically these connections will be effected over the same physical connection or communication channel such as internet  further shopping server  and merchant servers  can have many web pages stored in memory devices thereof as files in html format andor other formats shopping server  also includes product catalog  and shopper database  stored in a memory device thereof as described in detail below client computer  can request a display of a web page stored on shopping server  by issuing a url request through internet  to shopping server  for example a user of client computer  ie a shopper can select a product or plural products for purchase by navigating web pages stored on shopping server  and populated with product information from product catalog  product catalog  can be in the form of a database and can include product descriptions pricing and other product information for plural merchants and culled from merchant servers  using automated web crawlers as described in detail below the product information in product catalog  should be updated periodically to correspond with current product information on merchant servers  however as will become apparent below the product information need not be updated in real time the product information from product catalog  can be searched and displayed by product type part numbers price keywords or product features in any desirable manner using an interface of shopping server  as presented to the shopper by browser application  on client computer  the product information in product catalog  relating to products from plural merchant servers  can be displayed side by side in the browser window of client computer  to permit the shopper to comparison shop and choose products from any one or more of merchant servers  based on the product information for example the user may search for all instances of a particular item by product name or part number and may select for purchase the instance from the merchant having the lowest price upon logging in to shopping server  by entering a username and user id as identification data for example a user can be identified and thus can avoid the need for reentering previously registered data and preferences fig  schematically illustrates the communications channel connections of the preferred embodiment during an automated purchasing procedure for the sake of clarity the remaining description refers generally to only one merchant server  however it should be understood that the procedure described below can be accomplished for plural products from plural merchant servers  when a user selects a product for purchase by clicking on a “buy” button for example secure connection  is established between client computer  and agent server application  of shopping server  agent server application  then opens parallel secure connection  with the commerce server application of merchant server  secure connections  are illustrated as direct connections between computers for clarity however it should be understood that secure connections  can be ssl connections over internet  or any other type of communication channel also as illustrated in fig  first “cookie”  ie a file containing information such as identification information to be used by a server is established on shopping server  and second cookie  is established on client computer  first cookie  allows merchant server  to track status of its order acceptance process and second cookie  allows shopping server  to track status of its order placement process with reference to fig  first cookie  contains information identifying the order acceptance session between shopping server  and merchant server  ie a merchant session id the identifying information can be any character string or code by which merchant server  can identify the order acceptance session similarly second cookie  contains a “nonce” ie a onetime random string or other information identifying the order placement session between client computer  and shopping server  shopping server  maintains record  such as a database or a lookup table that associates the nonce of second cookie  with the corresponding transaction record  see description of fig  below by pointing to the transaction record  for example changes in transaction reporting from merchant server  are recorded in transaction record  because the two are synchronized by virtue of pointers from the nonces to transaction record  transaction record  also contains the corresponding merchant session id accordingly when the shopper resumes an idle session such as by confirming an order through client computer  shopping server  examines second cookie  and identifies the corresponding order placement session and status and is thus able to resume the session in a secure manner further shopping server  will locate the corresponding first cookie  and present it to merchant server  to resume the corresponding order acceptance session keep in mind that there typically are a plurality of order placement and corresponding order acceptance sessions occurring simultaneously the cookie management procedure described above allows all sessions to be correlated properly and thus permits a seamless shopping experience shopping server  uses information stored in shopper database  to act on the shoppers behalf during execution of a buy procedure of merchant server  shopper database  can include any appropriate information about registered shoppers such as their name address shopping preferences credit card numbers merchant account information such as a username and user id for the shopper at each particular merchant and the like of course all data in shopper database  can be collected during a registration procedure and encrypted for security in a known manner fig  illustrates the purchase procedure ie the function of agent server  of shopping server  in greater detail keep in mind that the purchase procedure ordinarily begins after the shopper has logged in to shopping server  or otherwise identified themselves uniquely the first phase of the purchase procedure permits the shopper to search products in catalog  browse for products in various ways and select one or more products for purchase from one or more merchant servers  after logging in main process  of agent server control application  generates buy form  for display to the shopper in the event that the shopper desires to change information in buy form  for the current purchase procedure the shopper can merely edit buy form  for example the shopper may wish to change the shipping address or shipment method of course the shopper profile can be edited to change the default shopper information in shopper database  buy form  is automatically prefilled with default shopper information corresponding to the shopper if such information exists as a shopper profile in shopper database  if such information does not exist for the shopper the shopper can be prompted to enter the information and the information can be used in the current purchase procedure main process  also creates transaction record  which keeps track of all transaction information including transaction status for the current transaction procedure such as credit card information billing addresses and the like from shopper database  and merchant skus of selected products shipping options and the like from product catalog  also main process  spawns buy process  and points buy process  to the corresponding transaction record as the shopper selects various products and options using the browser interface of client computer  transaction record  is updated note that at any given time there can be plural purchase procedures for plural shoppers each having a respective buy process  and corresponding transaction record  buy process  will continue to run in parallel with main process  until the purchase procedure is completed buy process  continually updates transaction record  based on shopper selections meanwhile main process  polls transaction record  for updated status in this manner main process  is updated with the status of each purchase procedure when the first phase of the purchase procedure is complete ie the shopper has selected all desired products and options from all desired merchants main process  presents confirmation page  to the shopper through the browser interface of client computer system  for verification of an order by the shopper confirmation page  is generated by communication between shopping server computer system  and the appropriate merchant server  using secure connection  between shopping server computer system  and the appropriate merchant server  in particular shopping server computer system  uses the information in transaction record  to verify pricing information shipping information and other details of the desired purchase with merchant server  by automatically going to each merchant checkout page or other information page and retrieving the updated information buy procedures of merchant server  are integrated into buy processes of shopping server  to allow buy process  to automatically navigate merchant server  back end test scripts or the like can be used to determine the particular buy procedure steps of merchant server  if account information for a particular merchant exists for the shopper in shopper database  that account information is used when executing the buy procedures with the merchant server  if not a new account is created for the shopper with the merchant and the account information is stored in shopper database  for subsequent use since shopping server  uses merchant account information that corresponds to the shopper the shopper can retain preferred buyer points and other benefits and discounts as if shopping directly at merchant server  keep in mind that in the preferred embodiment up to the time of generating confirmation page  communication has been between client computer system  and shopping server  using information from product catalog  which might not be entirely updated due to the fluid state of online commerce accordingly confirmation page  includes realtime pricing and shipping information obtained from merchant server  for each selected product in transaction record  upon receiving shopper confirmation of the order summarized in confirmation page  all transaction information in transaction record  is saved and second cookie  is saved to allow the procedure to restart later on with the same user session buy process  remains idle while waiting for the shopper to confirm the order by selecting a button on confirmation page  or taking other action in the second phase of the purchase procedure the purchase transaction is completed in particular second cookie  is used to resume the previous user session on merchant server  subsequently the order is executed on merchant server  using information in transaction record  to run a buy procedure and thus execute a buy process on merchant server  the order is then confirmed on shopping server  transaction record  is updated and receipt page  is generated showing the transaction information and confirmation numbers and the like from merchant server  once again it is important to note that products can be selected from plural merchant servers  and in such a case plural buy procedures will be executed and confirmed on the respective merchant servers  using the appropriate shopper account information automatically for each merchant server  it can be seen that the purchase procedure discussed above permits shopping server  to act on as an agent behalf of the shopper in interactions with merchant servers  however some merchants do not feel comfortable with shoppers using an agent web site in particular many merchants rely on advertising affiliate programs and the like in their business model and thus can only accomplish their business objective if the shopper “visits” ie directly views their web site and its buy pages in particular during shopping accordingly a proxy server mode of shopping server  can be used to offer many of the advantages of the integrated purchasing procedure disclosed above while satisfying vendors that desire to have the shopper visit their web site buy pages internet proxy servers are well known the phrase “proxy server” refers generally to a server that sits between a client application such as a web browser and a web server to intercept requests the proxy server then serves up substantially the same content as the web server to which the request was directed while also performing an auxiliary function such as filtering data monitoring data or serving up a cached copy of the web page in the preferred embodiment this general concept is expanded and applied to an integrated shopping environment in proxy server mode parallel secure connections  are set up between client computer and shopping server  and between shopping server  and merchant server  as illustrated in fig  the first phase of the purchase procedure is accomplished in the same manner as described above with respect to the standard mode to utilize proxy server mode merchant database  preferably includes form maps for mapping fields in the order forms of merchant server  to fields in shopper database  an external editing tool can be provided to develop the form maps in a known manner for example the editing tool can be configured to read the html forms and parse out the data fields these data fields can then be correlated to corresponding fields in custom database  during the second phase of the purchasing procedure when client computer  requests a web page from merchant server  shopping server  in proxy server mode handles the request and filters out the hrefs ie html document references and posts ie html form submissions to point to shopping server  instead of merchant server  when merchant server  sends a blank form to client server  the form is intercepted by shopping server  and the form is filled out with information from shopper database  when client computer  posts a form back to merchant server  shopping server  reproduces the post keeping intact all changes in the form content made by the shopper first cookie  and the second cookie  track the sessions as described above in proxy server mode when the shopper selects a buy button from confirmed page  or another page displayed on client computer  the shopping cart page or other buy page of merchant server  is displayed the shopper manually executes the buy procedure of merchant sever  using the interface of merchant server  as displayed on client computer  this manual procedure is accomplished for each merchant server  requiring the proxy mode accordingly in proxy server mode the shopper views all the buy pages and executes the buy procedures on merchant server  however shopping server  mediates and assists in filling out forms other aspects of the purchase procedure using proxy server mode can be similar to the purchase procedure described above without proxy server mode the invention facilitates online commerce by permitting an integrated buying experience from plural merchants the invention can be implemented over any type of communications channel such as the internet a local area network lan a wide area network wan direct computer connections or the like using any type of communication hardware and protocols any type of hardware or combination of hardware can be used for the various clients and servers accordingly the term “computer” as used herein refers to any type of computing device or data terminal such as a personal computer a portable computer a dumb terminal a thin client a hand held device a wireless phone or any combination of such devices the various clients and servers can be a single computer at a single location or multiple computers at a single or multiple locations for example a server may be comprised of a plurality of redundant computers disposed in colocation facilities at various locations to facilitate scalability any appropriate server or client software can be used and any communication protocols can be used communication can be accomplished over electric cable fiber optic cable any other cable or in a wireless manner using radio frequency infrared or other technologies any interface can be used for selecting products for purchase the various information can be stored in any format and thus the term “database” as used herein refers to any collection of information such as a database file a lookup table or the like as noted product catalog  can include product descriptions pricing delivery dates and other product information for plural merchants such product information may be culled from product information records of various sources by using automated crawlers as described below and updated periodically to correspond with current products available on merchant servers  the term “crawler” as used herein refers to any software that performs searches of content over a network and can include “bots” “robots” “automated site searchers” and the like referring again to fig  commerce system  includes client computer  executing browser application  and shopping server  which executes agent server control application  client computer  and shopping server  being connected to internet  which serves as a communication channel in addition in the preferred embodiment plurality of manufacturers servers  are also connected to internet  via non secure connections  in this regard shopping server  may be used to aggregate product information from a plurality of sources connected to internet  regarding products of a product category and store the aggregated information in product catalog  in the form of a taxonomy however it should be noted that the aggregation of product information may be attained using a computer that is separate from the computer running agent server central application  and the resulting information can be made available to the computer running agent server central application  fig  illustrates an example of taxonomy  of product catalog  taxonomy  includes st tier categories  nd tier categories  rd tier categories  and product specs ie specifications  and  note that taxonomy  is defined by a treelike structure in which categories include attributes that define a spec for products within the categories product spec  and  inherit the attributes of the parent category and can include values for the attributes and applicable units of measure the plurality of sources may include a plurality of merchants information sources and manufacturers product specification sources that are hosted in merchants servers  and manufacturers servers  respectively it should be appreciated that in the preferred embodiment the plurality of merchants information sources are merchants web pages  and the manufacturers product specification sources are manufacturers product specification web pages  additional sources of product information records can be various product literature sources which may be product literature web pages that review and provide additional information regarding a product or products of a product category in fact the manufacturers product specification sources can be considered to be merely a subset of the product literature sources also when manufacturers sell products directly over internet  manufacturers servers  are one in the same as merchants servers  in accordance with the preferred embodiment the shopping server  is operative to provide at least one crawler for visiting the plurality of sources hosted by for example merchants servers  and manufacturers servers  to aggregate product information from these plurality of sources regarding various products of a product category the crawler may include product literature crawler  that gathers product phrase information from the manufacturers product specifications web pages hosted by manufacturers server  the crawler may also include product offerings crawler  that gathers product phrase information and pricing information of each of the products in the product category from the merchants web pages hosted by merchants servers  of course it should also be noted that product literature crawler  may also visit merchants web pages and product offerings crawler  may also visit manufacturers product specifications web pages moreover a single crawler may be provided to perform the functions of both product literature crawler  as well as product offerings crawler  any type of number of crawler can be used in the preferred embodiment product literature crawler  andor product offerings crawler  may gather information form product catalog  regarding a manufacturers identity and product model as well as the product phrase information which preferably includes a phrase and at least one characteristic of the phrase from each of the plurality of sources by utilizing computational linguistics it should be understood that the term “phrase” which is gathered by crawlers  and  refers to an alphanumeric character string or strings present in a source such as manufacturers product specifications web pages  merchants web pages  andor product literature web pages not shown the term “characteristic” refers to some attribute of the alphanumeric character string in the web page for instance the characteristic of the phrase may be its frequency location font size font style font case font effects and font color of the phrase in the web page as well as the frequency of collocation phrases immediately next to each other and cooccurrence of phrases phrases within a predetermined words of each other moreover the term “computational linguistics” is used herein to refer to a crossdisciplinary field of modeling of language utilizing computational analysis to process language data such as any of the above noted characteristics of the phrase in the preferred embodiment crawlers  and  and the computational linguistics used thereby are software programs designed to execute the functions described thus by utilizing computational linguistics product literature crawler  andor product offerings crawler  gathers product phrase information which may be processed and used in the manner described below in accordance with the above discussion fig  illustrates the method of the preferred embodiment of the present invention where product literature crawler  obtains product phrase information utilizing computational linguistics module  the obtained product phrase information ie the phrase and the characteristic of the phrase are then stored in product phrase database  for further analysis commerce system  of fig  via shopping server  or by other means such as another computerserver is operable to further analyze the product phrase information using statistical analysis module  to thereby provide a ranking of the product phrases in any given product category these ranked product phrases will typically represent commonly found product properties of a given product or product category and are also stored in the product phrase database  in addition as will be described in farther detail below the preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes property definition tool  to analyze the stored product phrase information to thereby determine whether each of the product phrase information in product phrase database  is in fact a product property it should be understood that the term “product property” or “product properties” can be a word number phrase or combination thereof that descriptively characterizes the product or product category property definition tool  of the preferred embodiment is a software algorithm running on shopping server  or another device illustrated as steps in fig  thus for example product literature crawler  may examine the content of web page  of manufacturers server  such as a computer manufacturer or other server having a product literature source to obtain product phrase information provided on the web page including the phrase and the characteristics of the phrase as well as information provided in the web pages url address and any meta tags this product phrase information can then be stored in product phrase database  for further analysis in this example the computer manufacturers home web page will likely have a meta tag including the phrase “computer” as well as the phrase “computer” throughout its home web page which may or may not have special characteristics such as formatting and positioning which distinguishes the phrase from the remainder of the text on the web page because of the use of computational linguistics module  product literature crawler  is able to recognize and obtain such information regarding the phrase “computer” such as its presence in the home web pages meta tag frequency in its home web page and its other special characteristics to thereby statistically discern that the home web pages relates to computers and that the web pages linked to the home web page will also likely relate to computers and consequently determine that this phrase is a product property in particular a product category more preferably product literature crawler  may also crawl through a substantial portion of the linked web pages prior to determining whether the phrase is a product property to ensure accurate determination for instance product literature crawler  may crawl through the plurality of web pages linked to the home web page to gather product phrase information and in the present example will further likely identify presence of the phrase “computer” as well as other phrases known to be associated with a given product category such as phrases “mb ram” which is a collocated phrase “mhz” “floppy” andor “gb” etc based on analysis of the frequency and characteristics of such phrases by statistical analysis module  the phrase “computer” can be determined to be a product property that defines a product category in this regard separate category database  may be provided with various product categories and the likely associated key word phrases which may be cross referenced to ensure the accuracy of the product category determination furthermore in addition to or as an alternative to category database  a human verification process may be provided to further ensure accuracy of the product category determination in addition the plurality of web pages linked to the home web page will also typically include alphanumeric character strings ie data strings that identify other important characteristics of the product or product category again it should be noted that such significant character string will often be distinguished from the remaining text of the web page by its location on the web page formatting or other characteristic of the character string for instance the character strings may be positioned near the top or the left hand side of the web page and have a larger font size than most of the other character strings on the web page in this regard such significant character strings may have a prominent font size font style such as bold or font effects such as italicizing andor underlining etc referring to the present examples of computers important attributescharacteristics of computers such as its speed and capacity are likely to be indicated by a numeric string followed by phrases such as “mb ram” “mhz” “gb” etc because of the use of computation linguistics module  product literature crawler  is able to recognize and obtain the phrase and characteristics of the phrase such as its frequency location font size font style font case font effects font color collocation or cooccurrence as product phrase information such information can be retained in product phrase database  and statistical analysis module  can then be used provide a ranking of the phrases in any given product category and also stored in product phrase database  in particular statistical analysis module  will recognize that a particular phrase was emphasized by the presence of one or more characteristics and consequently provide a higher ranking for the particular phrase than other phrases that do not have a characteristic associated with it in the preferred embodiment of the illustrated invention the ranked listing of the phrases in product phrase database  can then be further analyzed by property definition tool  to determine whether the phrases in the product phrase information are in fact relevant product properties that descriptively characterize the product or product category it should be noted that preferably property definition tool  is executed by a human editor so that common sense judgments can be made relative to the ranked phrases which were generated utilizing a computer and statistical analysis module  however a computer or other logic device may be used to automatesemiautomate the function of property definition tool  as can be seen in fig  the determination of whether the phrases in the product phrase information are product properties is executed in step  preferably by a human editor if the phrase is determined to be not a relevant product property the phrase and the product phrase information is discarded and the next phrase is analyzed if the phrase is determined to be a product property ie the phrase descriptively characterizes the product or product category a determination is made as to whether the phrase is a numeric character string as shown in step  for instance in our example of computers exemplary numeric phrases would be the numbers quantifying ram hard drive capacity processor speed etc if the phrase is numeric a range and interval may be entered if appropriate and recorded for the corresponding numeric phrase in step  for instance relative to ram the computer model may be available with    or  mb of ram in this case the range would be  to  mb and the interval would be  mb then a determination is made as to whether the numeric phrase is evaluative as shown in step  ie the numeric phrase is indicative of a quality of the product andor impacts the desirability of the product as can be readily appreciated the number associated with ram is evaluative because the amount of ram directly impacts the capacity and desirability of the computer if the numeric phrase is evaluative the direction of evaluation is determined as shown in step  ie whether a higher value is better or a lower value is better again referring to our example computers with a higher amount of ram are more desirable than computers with less ram and thus a higher value is better and the direction of evaluation is better as the numeric phrase value increases the direction can be determined manually by a human editor or automatically via a computer or other device by correlation to price for example of course in certain product properties that are numeric and evaluative a lower value may be better for instance a lower value in the weight of a notebook computer would be more desirable than a higher value correspondingly the direction of evaluation facilitates ranking of each of the phrases as shown in step  thus the numeric phrase “” would be ranked lower than “” etc at least with respect to the product property of ram if the numeric phrase is not evaluative the human editor may enter a ranking for the numeric phrase based on hisher product knowledge and experience in step  and the next phrase may be analyzed of course because such a numeric phrase is not evaluative the ranking for the phrase will likely be low as compared to evaluative numeric phrases referring to the above step  if the phrase is not numeric a determination is made whether the phrase is discrete in step  and the enumerated value names for discrete phrase is entered in step  for instance relative to the present example the phrases “cdrom” “cdr” and “cdrw” are all discrete phrases that are also properties of a computer it is then determined whether the discrete phrase is evaluative in step  as can be appreciated these discrete phrases are evaluative in that they are indicative of a quality of the product andor impact the desirability of the product since each of these cd memory devices provide different level of functionality to the computer as known in the computer arts in this regard property definition tool  then enters the direction of evaluation as shown in step  and enters the ranking of the discrete phrases and correspondingly ranks the products as shown in step  in the present example the phrases “cdrom” “cdr” and “cdrw” are in the order of desirability in a computer as appreciated in the computer arts once again the order or ranking can be determined manually or automatically moreover if the discrete phrase is not evaluative then a ranking for the discrete phrase is entered in step  and the next phrase is analyzed of course because such a discrete phrase is not evaluative the ranking for the phrase will likely be low as compared to evaluative discrete phrases lastly if the phrase is neither discrete nor numeric then the phrase is designated as freeform text as shown in step  a ranking is entered as shown in step  and the next phrase is analyzed such freeform text would be relatively rare since the phrase was deemed to be a product property in certain products however such freeform text may be desirable and add value to the product or undesirable and diminish the value of the product for instance an autograph or inscription on a product may be considered as freeform text which would add value to the product in the preferred embodiment of the present invention illustrated in fig  once the analysis as shown in property definition tool  is completed on the product phrase information stored in product phrase database  the resulting product properties ie phrases that descriptively characterize the product or product category are stored in a product property database  in addition by executing property definition tool  these product properties that are stored in product property database  and are also ranked in order of significance in the product or product category thus in the above examples of computers product property database  will have a record of product properties such as mhz mb ram gb cdrom cdr cdrw etc as well as many other product properties and attributes relevant for evaluating a computer moreover through the execution of property definition tool  these product properties are ranked as well as will be discussed in further detail below these stored product properties of the product property database may then be retrieved and used to create catalog  for use in evaluating products that are available from various merchants on their respective merchants web pages to thereby provide a single shopping interface which seamlessly integrates plural online merchants to thus facilitate comparison shopping in an online environment of course it should noted that whereas the above aspects of the present invention have been described as applied to computers the present invention is not limited thereto and computers were merely selected as an example of how product literature crawler  and property definition tool  may be used in this regard it should be appreciated that the present invention may be applied to all different products and services that can be effectively marketed on a networked environment such as internet  thus the present invention may be applied to all goods as well as many services including insurance financial services rentals lodging transportation vacation packages etc in a manner similar to that discussed above fig  shows a block diagram of a method in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention for validating the product offerings of online merchants and for creating a new product record based on product properties as can be appreciated the lower portion of fig  provides an abbreviated illustration of fig  which was discussed in detail above which primarily explained the method for determining product properties as gathered from manufacturers product specification web pages  and other sources by product literature crawler  in a similar manner product phrase information may be gathered from the merchants information source such as the merchants web page  by product offerings crawler  which may also be generated by shopping server  thus like product literature crawler  product offerings crawler  gathers product phrase information from merchants web page  including a phrase and at least one characteristic of the phrase utilizing computational linguistics module not shown again the characteristic of the phrase may be its frequency location font size font style font case font effects and font color of the phrase in the web page as well as the frequency of collocation and cooccurrence of phrases in addition because each merchant will likely offer various models of more than one manufacturer product offerings crawler  also obtains information regarding product model and manufacturers identity moreover because each of the products may be purchased through a particular merchant at a specified price as designated by the particular merchant merchant identity information such as the merchants url and price information for each of the offered products are also gathered by product offerings crawler  so that information regarding the product price and the identity of the merchant offering the product at a given price are all correlated to one another all of the above described gathered information is stored into product offerings database  the details of how the manufacturers identity product model product phrase information merchant identity information and the pricing information are all gathered is substantially similar to the method described above relative product literature crawler  of fig  and thus are omitted here to avoid repetition however based on the teachings above it should be clear to a person skilled in the art how such information can be gathered utilizing product offerings crawler  and be saved in product offerings database  and used to create product catalog  thus in correspondence with the computer example used above products offerings crawler  may visit various web pages of computer merchants to gather all the required information regarding every make and model of computers offered in computer merchants web page  as well as the merchant identity information such as the merchants relevant url this information is stored in product offerings database  in a uniform format for further processing in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present method as shown in fig  once the above noted information is gathered and stored in product offerings database  it is validated using validation tool  to match the various merchant offerings to the product information stored in products catalog  in shopping server  shown in fig  as described previously the products catalog  on shopping server  stores product information such as product descriptions pricing and other product information for plural merchants which may be culled from merchant servers  using automated product offerings crawler  shopping server  accesses and presents the product information stored in products catalog  to client computer  to thereby provide a single shopping interface with seamlessly integrated plural online merchants to thereby facilitate comparison shopping in an online environment for each given product offering in product offerings database  products catalog  is searched to determine if there is a corresponding match present in products catalog  as shown in step  if there is such a match the validation is deemed to be completed for the particular product offering and another product offering in product offerings catalog  is selected for validation via validation tool  it should be noted that validation tool  may preferably be executed by a human editor who accesses via a computer or other means product catalog  however validation tool  may also be executed by a computer or other automated device if however a corresponding match in products catalog  is not found product record creation tool  may be executed to update products catalog  with the new product offering found in product offerings database  in this regard product property database  as described previously is accessed to provide the ranked product properties of a product or product category to product record creation tool  these ranked product properties which were obtained via product literature crawler  can be then used to create a record on products catalog  for the new product offering found in product offerings database  thereby ensuring the obtaining of the important product properties for the new product offering it is again noted that the product record creation tool  may preferably be executed by a human editor however product record creation tool  may be executed by a computer or other automated device correspondingly referring again to the computer example the ranked product properties which were processed via product definition tool  and stored in product property database  can be provided to product record creation tool  so that all of the important product properties for the new product offering are obtained and entered into product catalog  when a new record is created these product properties will include mhz mb ram gb cdrom cdr cdrw etc as well as many other product properties and attributes stored in the product property database  which are relevant for evaluating a computer of course again it is noted that application to computer sales were merely selected as an example and that the present invention may be applied to all different products and services that can be effectively marketed on a networked environment such as the internet  thus in this manner the present invention also allows new product offerings available in the marketplace to be easily integrated into the products catalog  thereby periodically updating products catalog  to ensure accurate offering of newest products and prices to client computer  however as can now be appreciated because the updating is attained via product offerings crawler  the product information is not updated in real time but rather periodically in the background of shopping server  the product information on products catalog  can be used to display products available for purchase by product type part numbers price keywords or product features in any desirable manner using an interface of shopping server  as described previously the product information can be displayed side by side in the browser window of client computer  to permit the shopper to comparison shop and choose products from any one or more of merchant servers  based on the product information once the shopper has selected all desired products and options from all desired merchants the shopper can complete the shopping and “check out” as described previously by confirming the order which verifies pricing information shipping information and other details of the desired purchase it is again noted that in the above described embodiment property definition tool  validation tool  and product record creation tool  are preferably executed by a human editor utilizing a computer or other device so that their execution is semiautomatic because of the present invention provides these distinct tools with distinct functions human editors having different skills and knowledge can be utilized for each of the tools for instance it takes a relatively lower level of skill and knowledge to execute validation tool  and product record creation tool  whereas it takes a higher degree of skill and knowledge to execute property definition tool  therefore this embodiment allows efficient human resource management since the tools and their respective functions are preferably separated and more experienced human editors can be assigned to execute property definition tool  and the less experienced human editors can be assigned to execute the other tools of course it should also be appreciated that in alternative embodiments the above noted tools may be combined in part or in total and can also be executed automatically via computer or other device so that use of human editors is not necessary another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in fig  the embodiment of fig  includes a property definition tool that is adapted to aggregate product information from plural sources such as merchant servers  and manufacturers servers  to produce a product catalog  in a highly automated manner property definition tool  can be in the form of software running on a general purpose computer such as shopping server  in the embodiment of fig  property definition tool  includes clusterer module  categorizer module  name selectorcleanser module  image selector module  property scraper module  supplemental keyword generator module  property aggregator module  description generator module  allied products discovery module  and postprocessing module  fig  illustrates a flowchart of the high level function of property definition tool  of preferred embodiment each step of fig  will be described in greater detail below in step  clusterer module  analyzes merchant offerings from plural product information records such as records stored on merchant servers  and clusters ie groups them according to which are most likely to be the same product and assigns or creates a upid universal product id for each of course the product information can be gathered from product information records using a crawler such as literature crawler  described above in this embodiment the crawler can retrieve product information records in their entirety for automatic processing by property definition tool  in step  categorizer module  places each upid into a category in a product catalog taxonomy based on a comparative analysis of that product with other products already classified in categories of the taxonomy the determination of product catalog taxonomies is generally well known in step  name selectorcleanser module  selects the best among multiple variant names for the product found in the product records of a group and then cleanses the name of any superfluous inserted or concatenated text that is commonly found in the name field of products it also then builds an optional longer name that is of a consistent style and has only the most relevant content for the specific category in question in step  image selector module  chooses the most preferable product image from all various product information records in a group based on size type quality proportion reliability of source and other factors in step  property scraper module  scrapes normalized attributes values for each product from every available product information record and supplies confidence ratings to every act of scraping that it performs in step  supplemental keyword generator module  repeats a process similar to that of step  but with reference to openended keywords for each group rather than for normalized attributes in step  property aggregator module processes the output of property scraper module  by employing a weighted voting engine to merge the many scrapings and determine a final value for each attribute of each product also in step  the supplemental keywords are normalized based on one of various algorithms in step  description generator  composes short texts describing each product such texts are nonevaluative and are based on templates using the attribute values attained in steps  and  for example this can be accomplished by randomly selecting one of a number of description templates that can be instantiated by reference to the most important properties of the product and then executing minor word or phrase variation to avoid monotony a final step ensures proper sentence formatting punctuation and capitalization in step  allied products module  recognizes related allied products such as accessories parts connectors etc and the bundles or kits that can be comprised of a set of allied products any items falling below confidence thresholds can be handled specially either manually or automatically in various ways allied products module  is described in greater detail below clustering accomplished by clusterer module  is the process of grouping together various merchant offerings which have no readytohand upid and creating a new upid for each group this process results in a oneproducttomanyprices relationship numerous features can be extracted from merchant offer records manufacturer records distributor records and other records describing products collectively referred to as “product information records” herein in order to enable clustering clustering can be run per manufacturer ie the “primary key” of the process can be the manufacturer name thus the first problem to be solved is determining that different forms of reference to the same manufacturer are indeed the same the risk of accidentally clustering products of different manufacturers is slight but when it does happen it can be a very critical error and therefore it is important for the system to avoid this error the system does so largely by discovering patterns in manufacturer part numbers and model identifiers note that this presumes that the manufacturer is already separated out of the product name which is not always the case—some product information records include the manufacturer or brand name as part of the product name field hence a first pass may be required to populate the manufacturer name field for use in clustering once the manufacturer or brand name is discretely obtained clusterer module  is given this name as a data string that it uses in a substring search in order to select all product information records where the manufacturer name begins with this substring for example clusterer module  may be started over the space of product offerings with manufacturer names starting with “bell” this will define the data set for the process as selected product offerings with manufacturer strings such as “bell atlantic” “bell industries inc” “and bell microproducts” these names are normalized removal of irrelevant parts such as “inc” and “corp” and further words are removed from the end until the minimum manufacturer name is found from the catalog that matches one manufacturer name from the catalog as an example there can be plural different names among data providers today that are all ways of saying “sony” and thus it requires more work in order to decide which of the plural “sonylike” manufacturer names should be used as “canonical” the system may use any manufacturer aliases from the various data sources and in addition aliases may be inferred as the catalog is “bootstrapped” and products are created and merchant offerings are mapped to the new products either manually or through upc matches which dont require manufacturer name merchants after defining a data set for a particular pass clusterer module  begins the clustering step there are a number of well known standard ai “clustering” algorithms any one of which could suffice for the baseline clustering however successful clustering of products often requires augmenting the baseline clustering with numerous elements and adjustments as explained below a simple outline of a baseline clustering procedure would be as follows a if there are not yet any clusters ie product groups then the first product becomes the first cluster b otherwise search through the clusters for a close fit c if there is a close fit combine it d if there is no close fit it becomes its own cluster there are several approaches for determining “close fit” the following sections explain examples of such approaches the first approach in determining what products are the same ie should be in the same group is examining manufacturer part numbers if available or upc or model ids and normalizing superficial variations in their nomenclature in so doing clusterer module  makes several passes and may merge together what were initially separate clusters as it narrows down the possibilities this narrowing down is in many cases a virtue of cluster module  “teaching itself” what the letternumber patterns appear to be inductively in various product families around the industry and using this knowledge to rule out bad data indeed clusterer module  operates differently in many respects because of the fact that bad data is common as opposed to how it could work in an ideal world where all data sources were pristine an example is that one manufacturer may give a part number to all of its video camcorders that starts with the letters “vcm” followed by one more letters and then three numbers however some merchants errantly insert their internal sku into the manufacturer part number filed in fact a very common problem because the internal sku of the merchant does not fit the numberletter pattern above and in fact is very far from it the system programmed to look for part numbers in the anticipated format would assume that the string having the internal sku is an error and proceed to examine other parts of the record where some other data might be found to enable the clustering of the offer in question for example despite the bad manufacturer part number the product name might be in perfect shape and a perfect match with many other offerings in the database clusterer module  should also be able to adapt the numerous ways merchants have of modifying the upc of a product few of them leave it as is some remove a leading zero or add a digit or two on the end that has their own internal meaning or remove the checksum digits through automated trialanderror clusterer module  attempts to deconstruct and reconstruct a particular merchants pattern of tweaking the upcs this is made possible by having at least one source where the definite and complete upc is known and then applying numerous known heuristic techniques to see which transformation rules will successfully reproduce the definitive upc from the merchants idiosyncratic upc this can be done using hidden markov models for example or using just standard logic programming a hidden markov model hmm is a well known variant of a finite state machine having a set of states q an output alphabet o transition probabilities a output probabilities b and initial state probabilities pi the current state is not observable instead each state produces an output with a certain probability b usually the states q and outputs o are understood so an hmm is said to be a triple a b pi hmms are known for use in speech recognition and other applications there are many other functions of clusterer module  that are discussed below after clustering is complete in step  of fig  autovalidation can be performed wherein additional merchant offers that appear over a period of weeks and months can be matched using the same methods generally as the original clustering in step  when present a model id or product name is often the best clue to whether items in separate product description records are the same and thus should be clustered together in the same group by clusterer module  however there are many ways in which this can fail which need to be accounted for the first is merely punctuation and capitalization such as the difference between “ sony md minidisc player” “ sony md ” “ sony md  mini disc personal player” another is that the model id may be concatenated together with extraneous terms such as “ sony black md ” “ sony silver md bb” where ‘bb’ stands for “bass boost” and is simply a feature that all such models possess and does not truly indicate its being a different product by contrast the difference between black and silver does indicate a significant difference as many persons who are shopping for a silver model would not want to have a black one and in some cases merchants may even charge more for one color than for another of what is otherwise the identical device while only elementary logic is required in order to handle and resolve difference in punctuation special handling must obtain for items such as color size and extra features of the product or even kits such as “ special sony md premium kit with mini speakers and leather case” in this case the difference in price the presence of “kit” the mention of items which the product database shows to be separate categories of products in and of themselves speakers case are all clues that there is a high probability of this offer being a “bundle” of products that includes the md and is not merely the md by itself in many cases a fuzzy string match can provide some clue as to whether offers might be the same and is critical in taking care of spelling errors in the source data eg “ sony minidisc player md” “ sony minidiscc sic player md” as a first pass fuzzy match on the entire string can easily round up a first batch of candidates for clustering for example the following list might be chosen from countless thousands of offerings as an initial cluster on fuzzy match alone “sony md minidisc player” “minidisc player md from sony” “sony new md music disc player” “m symphony synth from moog” “sony md personal music device” “sony inch minitv” note that all these have a significant overlapping portion of text content note however that “symphony” and “sony” have a  fuzzy match— of the  characters in both words combined are the same and in the same order this shows how inevitable it is that some fuzzy match candidates are still going to be wrong nonetheless that cluster module  has only  products to process not  is an immensely great narrowing down what remains is to identify the difference between md and md as being significant in order to separate the first item in the list above from the rest of items in the list and then to determine that the presence of “synth” or “moog” and “tv” invalidate the th and th items respectively clusterer module  should also ignore certain words note in the foregoing example the words “new” and “player” do not really add anything “new” is an example of an exceptional word that is so often used in the marketing of all kinds of products that it must be handled separately from the way a random word is handled specifically it needs to be ignored for all purposes except separating new from used or refurb products “player” on the other hand is helpful in an early pass to develop an initial cluster however the system must not assign such a great importance to it that the presence vs nonpresence of this single shall count as a different product this can be well grounded in the fact that “player” is a “generic noun” to refer to an entire category of products other examples are “tv” “cd” “video” and the like in particularly late stages of clustering step  generic nouns can be ignored because it is simply optional whether marketers include them or not in product names this does not take away from the fact that they are important clues in making a first pass at what should be included in the initial cluster numbers such as the “” and “” in “md” and “md” can obviously be critical to separating two models of products from one another as a general rule there being a different number in a model name or product name should be taken to indicate that it is a different product however there need to be exceptions to this as well for example “ hasbro wayne gretzky  action figure” “ hasbro wayne gretzky inch action figure mighty ducks” here the difference between “” and “” could make clusterer module  assume these are different products when in fact they are the same the best way to resolve this is for the system to know which attribute for a particular category might be expressed in numbers and also might be concatenated as part of the product name in this case sports action figures have jersey numbers as a possible attribute “” and they also have a height in inches “inch” by having the system check for these parameters it can be prevented from assigning a drastically lower probability of match merely due to the appearance of different numbers within the product name string in the absence of finding such parameters the system would lower the probability estimation of the products being a match whenever there are differing numbers present within the product name this is notwithstanding that additional numbers in the names can still rule out the clustering such as the difference between the “” and “” in the following “ hasbro wayne gretzky  action figure series ” “ hasbro wayne gretzky inch action figure mighty ducks series ” in determining which names are more likely to be significant for separating clusters ie forming groups of items corresponding to a specific product a differential frequency analysis can be performed between merchants that are specialized on certain categories and merchants that broadly cover many categories similarly between offerings already catalogued in a certain category and the entire catalog the result of this analysis is a list of terms for each category that are very much more frequent in that category than generally in the entire corpus this is useful in categorization of new items discussed later but also for clustering as words or phrases that are very common within one category are usually ones that the system can look upon as not indicating a difference between products in that category take for example the word “saber” this will be an infrequently mentioned word in the entire corpus but very frequently mentioned in action figures given the predominance of star wars action figures that “come with a light saber” now suppose the system sees two offerings as follows “ obi wan kenobi ″ nabo garb with light saber” “ obi wan kenobi ″ naboo garb” ordinarily the presence of “saber” in one but not the other would weigh rather heavily toward counting the items as different however the systems recognizing how common it is for “saber” to be mentioned in this category raises the likelihood that the word is merely an optional descriptive phrase and not special to one action figure versus another again this is probabilistic and merely one of many factors that can be assessed another pragmatic check which can help the system in clustering step  is checking prior probability eg examining how many strongly similar products are in the marketplace as evidenced by the content of the available product information records or other information if the number is high then the system should be suspicious even of minor differences in product names however if the number is low the system can be more tolerant of minor variations for example if there are only one or two “abraham lincoln action figure” products in the database then the probability of an offering constituting an additional product are relatively slim by contrast seeing that there are over  different “luke skywalker action figure” products in the database suggests that a new luke skywalker offering with minor differences in the name might very well be a new and different model in other words the odds of a luke skywalker action figure being wrongly clustered initially are very great—there is only a in chance that it belongs to any given group meanwhile if there are only  abe lincoln action figures then there is immediately a  chance of an offering belonging to on or the other cluster this can factor into the confidence of any clustering calculation in determining the number of groups the merchant coverage may be considered such that  the largest selection of similar items offered by a single merchant serves as a minimum number of groups for that family of items and  the diversity of product coverage of various merchants can be extrapolated to provide a further clue as to the correct number of groups for example if the system is addressing many hundreds of offerings that look something like “luke skywalker action figure” then supposing one merchant along offers  different “luke skywalkers” the system can presume on faith that this one particular merchant does not duplicate too many offers in its data set that at least  clusters are needed for this family of products further more if there are among products already upidized approximately  unique offerings per every  offerings altogether meaning for example that kb kids might have  such action figures where  of the  are unique in being offered by kb kids only and that this sort of ratio is the average such ratio found among all merchants whose luke skywalker action figures have already been upidized then the system can use this information in order to extrapolate over the remaining set of merchants which have not yet had their offerings of such products upidized as to how many estimated new unique products might be present assuming the same historical diversity ratio obtains all these measures are effectively “pragmatic” or “heuristic” measures which can be implemented as weights upon the confidence level of various tentative clustering combinations—a combination which accords well with the aforementioned measures ie falls close to extrapolated figures will have a higher confidence level than one which departs widely from such measures in many cases where names descriptions and specs make it hard to for clusterer module  to determine whether two products are the same the prices themselves are an important and possibly decisive factor for example if one offering is  and the other is  then despite superficially similar descriptions they are very unlikely to be the same product however there are several caveats first the clusterer must be careful to parse and analyze for any exceptional circumstances such as closeouts or clearance sales refurbished items and recertified items such as returned products in an opened box in some cases these items can be much lower in cost another difference that must be factored in is the typical differential in merchant pricing many firsttier merchants charge routinely up to  or even more than some discount merchants another consideration is the price competitiveness and consistency in the category in some categories the system can determined from items already catalogued that the price fluctuation among merchants is typically greater than that of other categories if after taking all these factors into consideration the price difference is still very great then the likelihood of the offerings being of the same product is lowered accordingly aside from merchant pricing most merchants also list the msrp of a product—usually to boast the apparent “savings” derived as the difference of the merchant price and the msrp since merchants usually adopt the same msrp from a manufacturer or distributor merchants will tend to be the same as each other in what they construe to be the msrp even more so than in the actual merchant prices themselves so when this information is available it can also be weighed in by clusterer module  in fact even more heavily than is the similar of merchant pricing like many other factors it should not be merely a boolean test but a weight because sometimes the data will be faulty eg through a merchants typo or merely through one merchant having an outofdate msrp while another merchant reflects the more uptodate msrp the dilemma in finding these parameters is that clustering ideally takes place prior to categorization this requires a tentative guess as to the categorization of the product despite that categorization is not final until the clustering is final thus a dialectical or iterative process flow between the algorithms of clusterer module  and categorizer module  is sometimes desirable or even inevitable clusterer module  might revise the cluster membership in light of a tentative categorization but following this the categorization must be checked again in which case categorizer module  might revise its category “guess” as a result of the cluster having changed this iterative processing must continue until both the result of clustering step  and categorization step  have stabilized and both have surpassed their required confidence thresholds the combination of both their outputs with the highest minimum confidence score between both clusterer module  and categorizer module  will prevail in other words if clusterer module  has cluster c or c and categorizer module  is outputting category a or b the following matrix of outcomes could result c  c  a    b     clustering confidencecategorization confidence assuming a confidence threshold for both clusterer module  and categorizer module  of  the system would go with cluster c and category b as the minimum confidence in that scenario is —better than in any other scenario and above thresholds for both of course other algorithms can be used to correlate the results of clusterer module  and categorizer module  generally the system assumes that the more words that are different in two product names the less likely they are to be the same product however the system needs to be able to construe synonyms hyponyms and hypernyms in an intelligent manner for example consider “sony md minidisc player” “sony inc md music listening device” on the surface there seem to be more words that are different than are the same however “player” is a hyponym of “device” conversely “device” is a hypernym of “player” meanwhile “sony” and “sony inc” would be treated as synonyms these words can be assigned partialcredit for a match these facts in combination with the matching model number are likely to be sufficient for cluster module  to confidently cluster these offerings further a product often comes in two or more variants for example a toaster oven may come in black and white and its model id might be any one of the following “pgb” where b signifies black “pgw” where w signifies “white “pg” where text description following mentions black or white or both other examples are rightlefthanded golf clubs etc these can show up as something similar to “titleist pro  driver r” “titleist pro  driver l” generally these variants though somewhat superficial from some points of view are nonetheless separate and individual part numbers from the manufacturer and are of no small significance to certain shoppers therefore they are given unique product ids they can however be related as part of a single product line or as configuration variants of a basic model eg when the righthanded golf club is considered the basic model the lefthanded is a variant or when the black toaster oven is considered the basic model the almond colored one is considered a variant etc whether products should be in any sense clustered is partly a matter of the purposeathand while generally clustering refers to the assigning a singlemodel ie product to its various price offerings by grouping together product information records corresponding to the product however there are meaningful configuration variants that while technically counting as different models are often thought by consumers and even retailers as being “essentially” the same model but just in varying styles etc likewise product models can be part of a series and multiple product series can be part of a product family etc clusterer module  therefore can provide plural levels of superclustering andor subclustering one among many possible semantic labeling schemata for these levels is as follows  product line  product family  product series  model  configuration of model the asterisk  indicates the baseline clustering performed by clusterer module  at the level of merchant offers can occur procedurally before any superclustering levels – and subclustering level  an example of all five levels would be the fujistu lifebook p with  mb ram the fujitsu brand has the “lifebook” product line in which is the “p” family of notebook computers as opposed to the“s” family within which is the “” series as opposed to the  series within which is the “” model as opposed to the  and  models and which can optionally come brand new with  mb ram as opposed to having  or  mb ram the same fundamental methods of clustering are used at any levels merely with a different set of differences in naming and specifications that either are or are not considered to be significant for the level in question categorization step  includes the process of assigning each upid to a proper category within taxonomy  this can be accomplished chiefly by two processes first the attributes and attribute value sets defined for each category in a known manner along with their aliases synonyms hypernyms etc can be examined second actual product information records already classified in each category can be examined any number of ai machinelearning algorithms can be used for the classification including but not limited to casebased reasoning genetic algorithms neural nets etc what is importation is the feature extraction that precedes the invocation of the machinelearning module and not so much which particular kind of machinelearning module is used in the feature extraction process of categorization step  each matching item that is found in the product information records whether an attribute name value unit of measure a brand name keywords and phrases found in product descriptions etc counts in favor of the product being in that category conversely items found that seem to conflict bring about major deductions in probability scores ultimately a final score is reached for each upid against each category the hope is that a confidence threshold will be surpassed on one and only one leafnode category in the minority of cases where this result does not obtain a manual or other external validation is can be used or the categorization can be deferred usually for marketing reasons resellers produce very long very “ugly” names for their products this is especially true in the online world where resellers are trying to please the search engines web crawlers as much as they are human beings—meaning they want to include every conceivable relevant piece of text in the product name otherwise they are afraid they might not get the search results ranking on google or yahoo search that they are hoping for the result is that a ideal product name such as “sony md minidisc player” is often listed in a product record as “new sony md md md minidisc player personal music listening device with rebate and free leather case now for grads and dads” fortunately not all names are this long and extraneous in nature however name cleansing step  is still required in many cases the first obvious step in determining an attractive name screen to be used for the upid product record is to eliminate those that are very long in favor of those that are not the other kind of undesirable name is that which tries to overload the name field as a miniproductspec table all in on such as “sony md hr battery  watt output headphones  oz” “consider this along with “sony corp md minidisc personal music listening device” here the length of the name alone does not help since both are nearly the same length yet the latter is greatly preferred over the former for cataloging purposes by noting that the former contains many attribute names and attribute value strings from the product record we can assign “demerits” to that name ie make it less likely to be selected as the product name by name selectorcleanser module  also marketers have a habit of overloading the name field of product information records to carry many other elements of information besides the name of product there is virtually no limit to this in terms of vocabulary however certain linguistic cues can be semantically related to marketing either through a manual list or through statistical accounting of which words are more commonly included in the marketing “fluff” that clutters product names the statistical approach is attractive in that is more automated this procedure requires some sample data to have been tagged as having “marketing language” in the names together with a contrasting set of data that shows the same product names without the marketing language a differential analysis with wordphrase frequency word contiguity and other standard statistical nlp methods can be applied to determine a good probabilistic profile of what constitutes marketing language for each category of product once name selectorcleanser  has narrowed down possible names to a simple concise clean product name it is also desirable to generate an optional longer name that is canonical canonical means that it follows a consistent form across categories which is to mention only a the most important variant configuration elements such as color righthanded and b the most important attributes such as the resolution of a digital camera having a reliable consistent style of long name lets those who utilize the catalog enjoy maximum flexibility in surfacing a short name or a long name as best fits their applications in step  image selector module  chooses the most preferable image from all various sources based on size type quality proportion reliability of source etc various rules and thresholds can be used to select the most preferable image for example the image may have to be of a certain minimum resolution and size alternatively image selector module  can be programmed to use the image from product information records from a list of preferred sources eg merchant servers  in order of availability in step  property scraper module  parses and analyzes the product information records such as web pages or pdf documents form a source such as a merchant manufacturer distributor reviewer or the like to extract the product spec information from that source in a normalized form property scraper module  can then discard or leave the text of the product information record in question property scraping step  can be accomplished as follows first dom document object modeling can be accomplished to separate the main product spec portion of the page from any crosssell or upsell merchandise and from any linked accessories etc next different sentence phrase and table structures can be parsed to spot individual specs on the page one at a time negation and other functions can be handled separately so that property scraper module  does not mistakenly construe these as being builtin to the product resolving of synonyms and aliases to normalize the jargon used among various product information records for both the attribute names and the values can also be accomplished bonus keywords or specs that do not fit predefined specs for the category of product in question including a gathering of any novel specs that would otherwise “fall between the cracks” can be retrieved a confidence level can be assigned to each act of scraping based on things like whether the attribute name and value were both found or just the value string was found or based on whether there some extraneous words found in between the attribute name and value or whether there were line breaks or adjacent cells in a table all of these items introduce some risk that the spec is somehow modified qualified or disclaimerized and therefore might possibly not be exactly the spec which it appears to be also the scraper may pick up conflicting information on the page eg they sell one size but later explain it is available in many so this lowers the confidence and higher confidence is given to the text that seems more likely to be correct ie the one that is more closely collocated with the other specs on the page the weighted combination of all these methods results is a confidence score for each individual spec value from each product information record that is scraped it is often important for the system to perform recognition and conversion of units of measure to a standard for each spec handling both synonyms eg “lbs” to “lb” and conversion eg “ lb” to “ kg” in the event that the attribute name cannot be found the units can sometimes reliably identify a correct value eg  megapixel camera does not need the word “resolution” in order to deduce that “ megapixel” is the resolution due to the uniqueness of the “megapixel” unit withing that category numbers must be parsed in all variously expressed styles including fractions roman numerals and those formatted with commas numeric ranges need to be recognized both as a possibility in the attribute setup ie having a composite attribute composed of “min” and “max” atomic attributes different types of verbiage may indicate a range such as a comma separated list of values eg for   or  players a hyphenated minmax range etc textualtype attributes may have different rules in specs a booleantype attribute noyes will require the attribute name to be present and not require the word “yes” correctly determining the “no” value is a bit more tricky as it requires the system to look for other negating language usually other than a simple “no” eg “optional” or “not included” in other cases particularly with attributes that allow multiple values or where the language of the values themselves is distinct enough not to require qualification by inclusion of the attribute within the product name field or within a definite description in the product text eg “this hdtv television    ” clearly indicates to the reader that “hdtv” refers to the “compatibility” attribute the source document from a particular product information record is often html xml pdf or another tagladen document type this is both a benefit and a detriment to property scraper module  in that these tags can both indicate and obscure the specs that are being sought therefore multiple passes utilizing different methods of handling the tags can be used as explained below one method is to simply ignore the tags by parsing them out this method simple though it may be actually yields a great deal of specs for example if an action figure product page on a website reads “height inch” it may read in the html sources as “height tcfont helveticabi inches” in other words there are intervening tags whose purpose is to align the information within a table change the font from one column to the next etc by merely tossing out the tags within one row of the table while keeping the information that it is within a single row the scraper sees “height ” and suddenly the spec is very near to being scrapable however in many other cases the tagging must be parsed and analyzed rather than merely discarded in order to yield the desired result take the same example as above where on the row above we might have “phantom series ” and on the row below have “vehicle included” by maintaining or parsing the rowdelineation tags property scraper module  knows that “phantom series ” is one row and “height ″ “is one row and ” vehicle included” is another if all the tags were ignored then property scraper module  would lose this row delimiting and would have the continuous string “phantom series ″ height  vehicle included” this would be harder to parse and analyze and there is probably some risk that the system might think the action figure is  inches in height and comes with a inch vehicle thus it is critical to actually parse the tags and thereby maintain the document structure there are a myriad of other ways in which the tagging is informative another case is where the system is trying to determine where the list of specs ends in a block of text often the product information record will for example switch fonts or text style or paragraph indentation when the specs are coming to an end and when a list of crosssell products is about to begin it is vital that this transition be noted so that the crosssell products are not accidentally construed as features of the main product itself eg construing a memory card that is an optional accessory for a digital camera as something that comes with the camera many product information records produce tables that do not unfortunately put the attribute name and value close to each other at all an example is the following pick the p series configuration that is right for you fujitsu pseries model ram wifi included os price p  no xp home  p  no xp home  p  yes xp pro  in this example multiple variant models are listed together in a single table and the header row must be parsed and one column at a time must be scraped in order to gather the specs correctly for each model some tables found in product information records are even more complicated in that they express multidimensional combinatorial specs a very common example is the combination of pants waist and inseam sizes that are usually available in some but not all possible combinations here is an example waist size inseams available colors avail ″–″ ″–″ black navy tan forest ″–″ ″–″ black navy tan forest ″–″ ″–″ black navy odd and even sizes available even sizes available note that not only must the table be parsed but the annotations must be understood in order for the scraper to actually assemble the following “canonical” table waist size inseams available inches inches colors available –      black navy tan forest –         black navy tan forest –         black navy the system must be configurable to force some attribute values to default to “no” or “none” when there are multiple sources which are silent about the attribute and not a single source has mentioned it this is needed because of the tendency marketers have of not mentioning when their product lacks a feature and mentioning it only when their product does have the feature for example only a few of the higherend digital cameras might have an interchangeable lens it is virtually guaranteed that if a product page makes no mention of this feature at all then the camera does not have one however no marketer will miss the opportunity to boast of their camera having this type of lens if it does therefore the system can detect this pattern and begin to default to “no” on the attribute “interchangeable lens” when it has found multiple reliable sources that fail to mention the feature for a particular camera supplemental keyword generator  analyzes every product information record with reference to openended keywords for each category rather than for normalized specs these follow from the dom analysis in that the system recognizes strings or tokens which it appears the product information record is putting forward as a spec and yet do not fit neatly into any predefined specs within the system this catches so special oneoff specs that otherwise would fall between the cracks for example among  different babycar seats there may be just one or two which say “onehand harness release” where this feature is not a recognized and normalized spec within the category attribute listing nonetheless that it is presented by a couple of product information records right along with the other specs for the same car seat enables the system to as it were add the phrase as an “appendix” of sorts to the normalized specs this is a very powerful feature for  categories where there are many esoteric and unique features that are not worth normalizing or  helping the system administrators stay on top of new emerging specs that appear as manufacturers add new features to their products the administrators will be alerted and review cases where a large number of overlapping supplemental keyword specs have been added for a particular category to see if the case constitutes a new spec that should be added in a normalized manner property aggregator module  of the preferred embodiment is a voting engine which assigns some product information records a greater weight than others and then attempts to merge the scraped specs from all product information records for a particular product to arrive at a final set of specs this resolves contradictions which are very commonly found among multiple sources the property aggregator assigns great significance to finding multiple attestations for a spec—defined as having multiple sources of data that have a different format therefore apparently not being mere clones of one another yet agree on the essential content of the specs in question the weights can be automatically set or manually set the automatic setting is a result over time of how often the product information record has been countermanded in the final result it is possible for a weighting to set either globally over the entire product information record or just for one category or just for one attribute in one category or just for one value of one attribute in that category or just for one manufacturer of products in that category also there is a separate weighting for image reliability globally per category per manufacturer and per manufacturerincategory chief components of the allied products module of the preferred embodiment are  a product relations tool for manually defining accessory relations between products and categories with constraints and for viewing or manually overriding specific products assignments as allied products that have been made automatically and  an allied products engine including logic and algorithms for combing the raw source data whence affiliated product relations will be automatically “discovered” all of the following relations are definable categorytocategory relation stipulates that products within category a are allied to products within category b a property constraint is optional for example compact flash cards may be allied to the category of pdas with the constraint that the memory module type for a pda must be “compact flash” in order for the relation to obtain categorytoproduct relation stipulates that a category of products are allied to a particular product an example would be “xbox cartridges” which taken as an entire category are allied to the particular product “xbox game console” producttocategory relation stipulates that a particular product is allied to an entire category of products with an optional constraint eg that a particular leather case is allied to the entire category of “digital cameras” with the constraint that their property of “form factor” be indicated as “compact” producttoproduct relation—stipulates that a particular product is related to another particular product eg that a particular model printer cartridge is allied to a particular model photoprinter a software tool can be provided that allows all the foregoing relations to be defined manually with or without constraints optionally marked as “potential” a software tool can be defined to allow a user to designate the allied product type as one of “accessory” or “part” or “supply” etc also there are “highlighted” types within each type—those which human editorial knowledge dictates as being of special interest in the absence of manually highlighted relations for each product the discovery engine autohighlights the highest scoring relations eliminating closely resembling products using category and fuzzy name comparisons in order to give variability in the top  highlighted relations eg you might want to simply highlight the size variations of the same compact flash card even though they may have the highest score a software tool can be provided to allow a potential relation to be negated ie for a user to indicate that a category should not be considered allied to another this is to help the discovery engine avoid erroneous or wasteful processing this is achieved by making a potential categorycategory relation with a manual score of  allied products module  includes algorithms to identify which component of various product information sources is the “allied products table” within the web page or other source for example which part of the html template of a merchants web page is reliably found to be its accessory listing this is accomplished by visiting the merchant pages and looking for references to current high scoring and manual relations then identifying and recording the area in the page where these links are found subsequent visits to the merchant sites can use this information to adjust the scoring accordingly depending on where links to possibly related products are found on the page the allied products module  follows links found in the various allied products tables and checks for products in known categories when the scanner has found n repeated instances of products in the same category for products in the category it is currently scanning it will autocreate the appropriate categorycategory relation marked as “potential” and notification can be provided to the appropriate category manager through email or another communications channel the allied products module  generally operates in accordance with the following algorithm to effect allied products step   for each product in a category a get all merchant offers for each merchant this part is multithreaded i load and parse the merchants web page also cache the page ii look for links on the page to “related products” iii if there are links on that page that lead to auxiliary accessory pages then follow the link and go back to ai iv reverse look up product references and relate them back to the catalog compute a product relation score and record the mapping and the score  calculate a final product relation score each of these algorithm steps will now be explained in detail a main challenge of the allied products module  is to be able to realize when a merchant is referring to a product on its web page due to variability in the expression of product names the only reliable way to specifically identify a product is through “merchant skus” or the unique product identifier that the merchant uses to refer to a product in order to be able to recognize that a link on the merchants page actually refers to a product already in the catalog it is necessary to perform the step of “merchant sku discovery” the first time that the allied products module  searches the url of a merchant it looks to see if it has done this before if it has not the program loads all of the urls from the merchant that are present in catalog  the urls are compared to each other and the variable part is determined to be a sku these skus are recorded for each merchant with mappings back to product ids in catalog  along with the delimiting characters that help to isolate the merchant sku from the url when a url is encountered on the merchants page the url is dissected using the delimiters and each substring the url is searched for in the list of skus previously recorded from the merchant if a match is found then the allied products module  knows that the url refers to a product in the catalog often when the allied products module  processes a merchant page or other product information source to look for related product links the merchant has decided to put the list of products on another page eg httpwwwbuydigcomshopphpprodidcnpsaadvcnet in such a case the allied products module  must analyze the language in links like this and follow them in order to find the product relations the allied products module  can use a minilexicon and can include the confidence that this link actually refers to accessories for the given product to the eventual scores for each resulting product reference sometimes links to accessory listings may actually be small images ocr can be used in a known manner to get the text out of the image many factors go into calculating a product relation score for relations that are discovered for each merchant these can include providing a higher score based on whether the related product was manufactured by the same company if the link includes language such as “    for    ” then the remaining part of the text is examined to see how well it matches and the score is increased or reduced accordingly this must take into consideration references such as “for palm  series” in which case it must be determined that a palm  should get a bonus as the word “series” indicates that the  is part of that in contrast if the link said “for palm  only” then the presence of the word “only” would indicate that a palm  relating to this product should get a lower score this kind of analysis requires identification of model ids and recognition of different types of includingexclusion language as well as series specification and matching of model ids if the link includes a generic reference to entire categories or products then a bonus is given if the category verbiage matches eg “viking mmcmmb multimedia card for a mp player pda or digital camera” when the pda category is scanned for example this requires good lexicon synonym coverage for category names parsing html document from the merchant and when a link is found the “group text concept” occurring prior to the link is searched for for example the heading before a set of related product links may be “addons” or “accessories for the xxx” etc this is difficult as there are a number of ways a merchant may do this in html placement text characteristics and language are all considered when looking for what these product links might refer to when the group text concept is found the score is increased if the language indicates that the list of links constitutes related products the score is reduced for other types of relations such as “other people who bought this product also bought these    ” sometimes these “headers” are actually small images so using ocr to get the text out of the image must be used in these cases discarding references to the products within the same category considering the price of the related product as generally an accessory of a major product will cost less than a major product such as a digital camera or notebook computer once all of the relations have been gathered for a product from all of the merchants then the overall relation scores are calculated the following can be factors in the computation all of the merchant references are gathered and higher scores are given to related products that were referred to by more than one merchant this is not entirely reliable as not all merchants may carry the product being scanned for example there may be only  merchant in our list of merchants for a given product the merchant rating set manually by the catalog editor for how well it specifies related products increases or decreases its contribution to the overall score for a given relation the potential categorycategory relations are taken into consideration and also contribute to modifying the score both positively and negatively depending on the score of the potential relation that was previously discovered when a whole category of products has been scanned the following can be considered in order to determine if the whole category itself can be allied to some products or to some other categories category counts—the total number of related products in each category are counted up categories with more related products in them are more likely to be validly related on the whole as an allied category of products so the scores are adjusted accordingly based on the category counts for example in the category of “handheld device cases” nearly every product within this category will already have a relation or many relations to other products this fact indicates strongly that the entire category itself ie “handheld device cases” has a better chance of being itself validly related to some products as an allied category of products give score penalties for the related category being a “miscellaneous” type of category—although such a category may contain some products that would have valid relations generally the miscellaneous category on the whole is not relevant to any particular product give a score penalty for relations from sibling categories since so long as the category tree is well conceived such relations are usually bad eg a desktop related to a notebook the catalog editor may mark certain categories as being better or worse for the likelihood of having related products and the system will use that information to adjust the scores these are the potential categorycategory relations if the scores pass a scanning threshold then they are saved to the database where the scores may be manually overridden if need be there are actually two thresholds a “scanning threshold” and a “publish threshold” if the “scanning threshold” is met the relation is saved even though it may not get published the idea here is that a good relation may get a low score for some reason but that the user may manually override the score if the relation is deemed worthy of publishing a final pass for each product is to “highlight” the top  or top n products the highlighted related products are composed of the highest scoring products as well as the products that are not too similar looking in order to give a good variety to the user when the related products page is first viewed the allied products module  takes the relation with the highest score then moves onto the next one checking the category that it is in and similarities in the product names if the products go over a similarity threshold then the second product is not highlighted and the system moves onto the third highest scoring relation and so on a catalog editor may manually highlight products and these take precedence sometimes many relations are found that are very similar making the browsing of these products tedious the allied products module  provides clustering information that allows the application such as a web browser to optionally show the highest scoring relation in a cluster and not show others but instead show a “more like this    ” link the clusters are created using the opposite logic of the highlighting phase and score relations on their similarity including the category manufacturer fuzzy product name match particularly differences that focus on varianttype language including differing by one attribute etc manually created cluster patterns price etc once the allied products list is created and saved product information records can be retrieved from merchants for products in accessory categories marked in the taxonomy product links or language that would signify what productsmodels this is allied to can be located by doing a look up in a product database and assigning confidence levels to the results using known sophisticated parsing techniques the results from all merchants can be aggregated a voting mechanism can be applied and another list can be created both of these lists of relations can be used to derive an aggregated score if the score is greater than a predetermined threshold then the producttoproduct link can be created in the table this can include an inference to other product relations because of the main product being in a product line eg one case may fit all palm m series on secondpass scanning only “potential” relations will be considered the engine will ignore links not found to abide by these potential relations but will archive the items thus ignored when a certain mass of such items has been accumulated or when a specified time period has elapsed the firstpass scanning will be repeated during the aforementioned procedures of clusterer module  categorizer module  property scraper module  property aggregator module  description generator module  and allied products module  any number of products or offerings or relations or bundles can and will fall below required confidence thresholds post processing module  handles such products these can either be deferred and saved until more data is available for the automated system to work from or they can be retained in an incomplete and merely quasi“upidized” form alternatively they can be moved over to a tool for human editors to patch them up as much as possible eg a product may not have had enough information to classify a tv between crt tvs and portable tvs with enough confidence and so an appropriate error status would be set drawing a human beings attention right to the attribute that is in question so that it can be filled in previous tests of the entire procedure outlined in this documented have resulted in at least  automation ie labor reduction compared to using the “bruteforce” method of manual data entry and as high as  in some categories while maintaining comparable accuracy and actually superior normalization to manual methods this is from a test of over twenty diverse product categories ranging from action figures to heart monitors to baby car seats furthermore it should also be noted that one embodiment of the present invention has been described above where the internet is the networked computer environment and the crawler is a web crawler moreover in the embodiment described above the manufacturers product specifications web pages are deemed to be the manufacturers product specifications source and the merchants web page are deemed to be the merchants information source however the present invention is not limited thereto and may be applied to other types of networked computer environments and other sources as well the present invention can be implemented over any type of communications channel such as the internet a local area network lan a wide area network wan direct computer connections or the like using any type of communication hardware and protocols any type of hardware or combination of hardware can be used for the various clients and servers accordingly the term “computer” as used above refers to any type of computing device or data terminal such as a personal computer a portable computer a dumb terminal a thin client a hand held device a wireless phone or any combination of such devices the various clients and servers can be a single computer at a single location or multiple computers at a single or multiple locations for example a server may be comprised of a plurality of redundant computers disposed in colocation facilities at various locations to facilitate scalability any appropriate server or client software can be used and any communication protocols can be used communication can be accomplished over electric cable fiber optic cable any other cable or in a wireless manner using radio frequency infrared or other technologies any interface can be used for selecting products for purchase the various information can be stored in any format and thus the term “database” as used above refers to any collection of information such as a database file a lookup table or the like thus the above described method and apparatus in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention provides a very effective system and method for aggregating desirable product information as can now be fully appreciated the present invention facilitates online commerce by allowing the provision of important product information to the shopper to thereby facilitate an informed purchase decision by the shopper the present invention also provides a novel method for efficiently aggregating such product information from a networked computer environment and also provides a novel method for providing updated product information to shoppers thereby facilitating the purchase decision of the shopper the invention has been described through a preferred embodiment however various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and legal equivalents glossary allied product a product that integrates functionally with another product—eg an accessory envelope feeder for a printer part replacement screen

data source as an allied product of another product ie how sure is the system that what a given web page is saying is that product a is an accessory for product b domdocument object modeling analyzing an html web page to segment it into various regions eg header footer product spec table product text description recommended accessories crosssellupsell product listing nav bar ad blocks etc this can be a preliminary step to set up property scraping item clustering accessory discovery etc minimum manufacturer name the resulting string after a manufacturer name string has removed from various extraneous or common suffixes such as “inc” “corp” etc normalization the process of identifying attribute names andor attribute values which have the same meaning but are expressed in superficially different nomenclature and mapping them to a single consistent form of expression normalized attribute value sets attribute value sets that are fully normalized see normalization including any applicable unitsofmeasure the attribute names themselves may or may not be normalized normalized attributes normalized attributes are those where the name of each attribute is normalized—the value set for the attribute may or may not be normalized normalized specs a set of data consisting of attribute namevalueunit information where all of these elements are normalized potential relation establishes a relation as valid by definition but subject to specific product compatibility testing eg styluses are “potentially” linked to pdas in general but are subject to compatibility prior probability the odds of a random guess being correct out of all the possibilities that conceptually exist eg in clustering if there are  products of a given type in the catalog and a new unknown offering is about to be analyzed its clustering has a prior probability of  reflecting the in chance of its either being the same as one of the  products in the database or being a third new one a new offering compared against  catalogued products would have a prior probability for clustering of  the prior probability can affect the confidence estimations at various stages of clustering prior probability plays a role mutatis mutandis in various other aspects in autogeneration of catalog product bundle a main product combined with any number of accessories parts or supplies property an attribute that either is intrinsic or else derives solely from perception of or use of the product in respect to its intrinsic properties some attributes of a product such as brand price and distributor sku are not properties as they may derive from other external forces apart from use of the product quasiupidized a set of data representing product offers that have been in most instances upidized but where a minority of product offers are not upidized see upid sister product a similar though distinctly different product that is a member of the same product line series or family eg palm v vs palm vx taxonomy a hierarchical tree or other grouping of product categories upid “universal product id” an identifier of one particular product among its multiple variously described and variously named offers where available a manufacturer part number model id catalog number or isbn number can serve as the upid in many cases no such upid exists in external data sources and must be created and assigned by the system variant product a version of a product that has a difference in feature configuration from the manufacturer or dealer but is essentially the same product eg a

enron breaking news featureprofessional issues the rise and fall of enron when a company looks too good to be true it usually is by c william thomas related topics fraudaccounting and financial reporting internal control over financial reporting if you’re like most you’ve been astonished disillusioned and angered as you learned of the meteoric rise and fall of enron corp remember the company’s television commercial of not so long ago ending with the reverberating phrase “ask why why why” that question is now on everyone’s lips the enron case is a dream for academics who conduct research and teach for those currently or formerly involved with the company such as creditors auditors the sec and accounting regulators it’s a nightmare that will continue for a long time  formal investigations of enron are now under way headed by the company’s board the sec the justice department and congress the exact causes and details of the disaster may not be known for months the purpose of this article is to summarize preliminary observations about the collapse as well as changes in financial reporting auditing and corporate governance that are being proposed in response by big five accounting firms the aicpa and the sec in a way its simple in a way its not on the surface the motives and attitudes behind decisions and events leading to enron’s eventual downfall appear simple enough individual and collective greed born in an atmosphere of market euphoria and corporate arrogance hardly anyone—the company its employees analysts or individual investors—wanted to believe the company was too good to be true so for a while hardly anyone did many kept on buying the stock the corporate mantra and the dream in the meantime the company made many highrisk deals some of which were outside the company’s typical asset risk control process many went sour in the early months of  as enron’s stock price and debt rating imploded because of loss of investor and creditor trust methods the company used to disclose or creatively obscure its complicated financial dealings were erroneous and in the view of some downright deceptive the company’s lack of transparency in reporting its financial affairs followed by financial restatements disclosing billions of dollars of omitted liabilities and losses contributed to its demise the whole affair happened under the watchful eye of arthur andersen llp which kept a whole floor of auditors assigned at enron yearround the beginning presages the end in  after federal deregulation of natural gas pipelines enron was born from the merger of houston natural gas and internorth a nebraska pipeline company in the process of the merger enron incurred massive debt and as the result of deregulation no longer had exclusive rights to its pipelines in order to survive the company had to come up with a new and innovative business strategy to generate profits and cash flow kenneth lay ceo hired mckinsey  co to assist in developing enron’s business strategy it assigned a young consultant named jeffrey skilling to the engagement skilling who had a background in banking and asset and liability management proposed a revolutionary solution to enron’s credit cash and profit woes in the gas pipeline business create a “gas bank” in which enron would buy gas from a network of suppliers and sell it to a network of consumers contractually guaranteeing both the supply and the price charging fees for the transactions and assuming the associated risks thanks to the young consultant the company created both a new product and a new paradigm for the industry—the energy derivative lay was so impressed with skilling’s genius that he created a new division in  called enron finance corp and hired skilling to run it under skilling’s leadership enron finance corp soon dominated the market for natural gas contracts with more contacts more access to supplies and more customers than any of its competitors with its market power enron could predict future prices with great accuracy thereby guaranteeing superior profits the best the brightest and the dreaded prc skilling began to change the corporate culture of enron to match the company’s transformed image as a trading business he set out on a quest to hire the best and brightest traders recruiting associates from the top mba schools in the country and competing with the largest and most prestigious investment banks for talent in exchange for grueling schedules enron pampered its associates with a long list of corporate perks including concierge services and a company gym skilling rewarded production with meritbased bonuses that had no cap permitting traders to “eat what they killed” one of skilling’s earliest hires in  was andrew fastow a yearold kellogg mba who had been working on leveraged buyouts and other complicated deals at continental illinois bank in chicago fastow became skilling’s protg in the same way skilling had become lay’s fastow moved swiftly through the ranks and was promoted to chief financial officer in  as skilling oversaw the building of the company’s vast trading operation fastow oversaw its financing by ever more complicated means as enron’s reputation with the outside world grew the internal culture apparently began to take a darker tone skilling instituted the performance review committee prc which became known as the harshest employeeranking system in the country it was known as the “degree review” based on the values of enron—respect integrity communication and excellence rice however associates came to feel that the only real performance measure was the amount of profits they could produce in order to achieve top ratings everyone in the organization became instantly motivated to “do deals” and post earnings employees were regularly rated on a scale of  to  with s usually being fired within six months the lower an employee’s prc score the closer he or she got to skilling and the higher the score the closer he or she got to being shown the door skilling’s division was known for replacing up to  of its workforce every year fierce internal competition prevailed and immediate gratification was prized above longterm potential paranoia flourished and trading contracts began to contain highly restrictive confidentiality clauses secrecy became the order of the day for many of the company’s trading contracts as well as its disclosures how high they fly coincidentally but not inconsequentially the us economy during the s was experiencing the longest bull market in its history enron’s corporate leadership lay excluded comprised mostly young people who had never experienced an extended bear market new investment opportunities were opening up everywhere including markets in energy futures wall street demanded doubledigit growth from practically every venture and enron was determined to deliver in  skilling became enron’s chief operating officer he convinced lay the gas bank model could be applied to the market for electric energy as well skilling and lay traveled widely across the country selling the concept to the heads of power companies and to energy regulators the company became a major political player in the united states lobbying for deregulation of electric utilities in  enron acquired electric utility company portland general electric corp for about  billion by the end of that year skilling had developed the division by then known as enron capital and trade resources into the nation’s largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity revenue grew to  billion from  billion and the number of employees in the division skyrocketed to more than  from  using the same concept that had been so successful with the gas bank they were ready to create a market for anything that anyone was willing to trade futures contracts in coal paper steel water and even weather perhaps enron’s most exciting development in the eyes of the financial world was the creation of enron online eol in october  eol an electronic commodities trading web site was significant for at least two reasons first enron was a counterparty to every transaction conducted on the platform traders received extremely valuable information regarding the “long” and “short” parties to each trade as well as the products’ prices in realtime second given that enron was either a buyer or a seller in every transaction credit risk management was crucial and enron’s credit was the cornerstone that gave the energy community the confidence that eol provided a safe transaction environment eol became an overnight success handling  billion in online commodity trades in  the world of technology opened up the internet and the ipo market for technology and broadband communications companies started to take off in january  enron announced an ambitious plan to build a highspeed broadband telecommunications network and to trade network capacity or bandwidth in the same way it traded electricity or natural gas in july of that year enron and blockbuster announced a deal to provide video on demand to customers throughout the world via highspeed internet lines as enron poured hundreds of millions into broadband with very little return wall street rewarded the strategy with as much as  on the stock price—a factor that would have to be discounted later when the broadband bubble burst in august  enron’s stock hit an alltime high of  and the company was being touted by fortune and other business publications as one of the most admired and innovative companies in the world the role of marktomarket accounting enron incorporated “marktomarket accounting” for the energy trading business in the mids and used it on an unprecedented scale for its trading transactions under marktomarket rules whenever companies have outstanding energyrelated or other derivative contracts either assets or liabilities on their balance sheets at the end of a particular quarter they must adjust them to fair market value booking unrealized gains or losses to the income statement of the period a difficulty with application of these rules in accounting for longterm futures contracts in commodities such as gas is that there are often no quoted prices upon which to base valuations companies having these types of derivative instruments are free to develop and use discretionary valuation models based on their own assumptions and methods the financial accounting standards board’s fasb emerging issues task force has debated the subject of how to value and disclose energyrelated contracts for several years it has been able to conclude only that a onesizefitsall approach will not work and that to require companies to disclose all of the assumptions and estimates underlying earnings would produce disclosures that were so voluminous they would be of little value for a company such as enron under continuous pressure to beat earnings estimates it is possible that valuation estimates might have considerably overstated earnings furthermore unrealized trading gains accounted for slightly more than half of the company’s  billion reported pretax profit for  and about onethird of its reported pretax profit for  capitalism at work in the latter part of the s companies such as dynegy duke energy el paso and williams began following enron’s lead enron’s competitive advantage as well as its huge profit margins had begun to erode by the end of  each new market entrant’s successes squeezed enron’s profit margins further it ran with increasing leverage thus becoming more like a hedge fund than a trading company meanwhile energy prices began to fall in the first quarter of  and the world economy headed into a recession thus dampening energy market volatility and reducing the opportunity for the large rapid trading gains that had formerly made enron so profitable deals especially in the finance division were done at a rapid pace without much regard to whether they aligned with the strategic goals of the company or whether they complied with the company’s risk management policies as one knowledgeable enron employee put it “good deal vs bad deal didn’t matter if it had a positive net present value npv it could get done sometimes positive npv didn’t even matter in the name of strategic significance” enron’s foundations were developing cracks and skilling’s house of paper built on the stilts of trust had begun to crumble related parties and complex special purpose entities in order to satisfy moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies enron had to make sure the company’s leverage ratios were within acceptable ranges fastow continually lobbied the ratings agencies to raise enron’s credit rating apparently to no avail that notwithstanding there were other ways to lower the company’s debt ratio reducing hard assets while earning increasing paper profits served to increase enron’s return on assets roa and reduce its debttototalassets ratio making the company more attractive to credit rating agencies and investors enron like many other companies used “special purpose entities” spes to access capital or hedge risk by using spes such as limited partnerships with outside parties a company is permitted to increase leverage and roa without having to report debt on its balance sheet the company contributes hard assets and related debt to an spe in exchange for an interest the spe then borrows large sums of money from a financial institution to purchase assets or conduct other business without the debt or assets showing up on the company’s financial statements the company can also sell leveraged assets to the spe and book a profit to avoid classification of the spe as a subsidiary thereby forcing the entity to include the spe’s financial position and results of operations in its financial statements fasb guidelines require that only  of the spe be owned by an outside investor under fastow’s leadership enron took the use of spes to new heights of complexity and sophistication capitalizing them with not only a variety of hard assets and liabilities but also extremely complex derivative financial instruments its own restricted stock rights to acquire its stock and related liabilities as its financial dealings became more complicated the company apparently also used spes to “park” troubled assets that were falling in value such as certain overseas energy facilities the broadband operation or stock in companies that had been spun off to the public transferring these assets to spes meant their losses would be kept off enron’s books to compensate partnership investors for downside risk enron promised issuance of additional shares of its stock as the value of the assets in these partnerships fell enron began to incur larger and larger obligations to issue its own stock later down the road compounding the problem toward the end was the precipitous fall in the value of enron stock enron conducted business through thousands of spes the most controversial of them were ljm cayman lp and ljm coinvestment lp run by fastow himself from  through july  these entities paid fastow more than  million in management fees far more than his enron salary supposedly with the approval of top management and enron’s board of directors in turn the ljm partnerships invested in another group of spes known as the raptor vehicles which were designed in part to hedge an enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company rhythm netconnections as part of the capitalization of the raptor entities enron issued common stock in exchange for a note receivable of  billion enron increased notes receivable and shareholders’ equity to reflect this transaction which appears to violate generally accepted accounting principles additionally enron failed to consolidate the ljm and raptor spes into their financial statements when subsequent information revealed they should have been consolidated obscure disclosures revealed a very confusing footnote in enron’s  financial statements described the above transactions douglas carmichael the wollman distinguished professor of accounting at baruch college in new york city told the wall street journal in november of  that most people would be hard pressed to understand the effects of these disclosures on the financial statements casting doubt on both the quality of the company’s earnings as well as the business purpose of the transaction by april  other skeptics arrived on the scene a number of analysts questioned the lack of transparency of enron’s disclosures one analyst was quoted as saying “the notes just don’t make sense and we read notes for a living” skilling was very quick to reply with arrogant comments and in one case even called an analyst a derogatory name what skilling and fastow apparently underestimated was that because of such actions the market was beginning to perceive the company with greater and greater skepticism thus eroding its trust and the company’s reputation it all comes tumbling down in february  lay announced his retirement and named skilling president and ceo of enron in february skilling held the company’s annual conference with analysts bragging that the stock then valued around  should be trading at around  per share in march enron and blockbuster announced the cancellation of their videoondemand deal by that time the stock had fallen to the mids throughout the spring and summer risky deals enron had made in underperforming investments of various kinds began to unravel causing it to suffer a huge cash shortfall senior management which had been voting with its feet since august  selling enron stock in the bull market continued to exit collectively hundreds of millions of dollars richer for the experience on august  just six months after being named ceo skilling himself resigned citing “personal reasons” the stock price slipped below  that week and except for a brief recovery in early october after the sale of portland general continued its slide to below  a share also in august in an internal memorandum to lay a company vicepresident sherron watkins described her reservations about the lack of disclosure of the substance of the related party transactions with the spes run by fastow she concluded the memo by stating her fear that the company might “implode under a series of accounting scandals” lay notified the company’s attorneys vinson  elkins as well as the audit partner at enron’s auditing firm arthur andersen llp so the matter could be investigated further the proverbial “ship” of enron had struck the iceberg that would eventually sink it on october  enron announced its first quarterly loss in more than four years after taking charges of  billion on poorly performing businesses the company terminated the raptor hedging arrangements which if they had continued would have resulted in its issuing  million enron shares to offset the company’s private equity losses severely diluting earnings it also disclosed the reversal of the  billion entry to assets and equities it had made as a result of dealings with these arrangements it was this disclosure that got the sec’s attention on october  the company announced it had changed plan administrators for its employees’ k pension plan thus by law locking their investments for a period of  days and preventing workers from selling their enron stock the company contends this decision had in fact been made months earlier however true that might be the timing of the decision certainly has raised suspicions on october  enron announced the sec was looking into the related party transactions between enron and the partnerships owned by fastow who was fired two days later on november  enron announced a restatement of its financial statements back to  to reflect consolidation of the spes it had omitted as well as to book andersen’s recommended adjustments from those years which the company had previously “deemed immaterial” this restatement resulted in another  million in losses over the four years as well as an additional  million in liabilities as of the end of  the equity markets immediately reacted to the restatement driving the stock price to less than  a share one analyst’s report stated the company had burned through  billion in cash in  days a merger agreement with smaller crosstown competitor dynegy was announced on november  but rescinded by dynegy on november  on the basis of enron’s lack of full disclosure of its offbalancesheet debt downgrading enron’s rating to junk status on november  the stock closed at an astonishing  cents a share the company filed for bankruptcy protection on december  the aftermath unquestionably the enron implosion has wreaked more havoc on the accounting profession than any other case in us history critics in the media congress and elsewhere are calling into question not only the adequacy of us disclosure practices but also the integrity of the independent audit process the general public still questions how cpa firms can maintain audit independence while at the same time engaging in consulting work often for fees that dwarf those of the audit companies that deal in special purpose entities and complex financial instruments similar to enron’s have suffered significant declines in their stock prices the scandal threatens to undermine confidence in financial markets in the united states and abroad in a characteristic move the sec and the public accounting profession have been among the first to respond to the enron crisis unfortunately and sadly reminiscent of financial disasters in the s and s this response will likely be viewed by investors creditors lawmakers and employees of enron as “too little too late” in an “oped” piece for the wall street journal on december  sec chairman harvey pitt called the current outdated reporting and financial disclosure system the financial “perfect storm” he stated that under the current quarterly and annual reporting system information is often stale on arrival and mandated financial disclosures are often “arcane and impenetrable” to reassure investors and restore confidence in financial reporting pitt called for a joint response from the public and private sectors that included among other things a system of “current” disclosures supplementing and updating quarterly and annual information with disclosure of material information on a realtime basis public company disclosure of significant current “trend” and “evaluative” data in addition to historical information identification of “most critical accounting principles” by all public companies in their annual reports more timely and responsive accounting standard setting on the part of the private sector an environment of cooperation between the sec and registrants that encourages public companies and their auditors to seek advice on disclosure issues in advance an effective and transparent system of selfregulation for the accounting profession subject to sec’s rigorous but nonduplicative oversight more proactive oversight by audit committees who understand financial accounting principles as well as how they are applied the ceos of the big five accounting firms made a joint statement on december  committing to develop improved guidance on disclosure of related party transactions spes and market risks for derivatives including energy contracts for the  reporting period in addition the big five called for modernization of the financial reporting system in the united states to make it more timely and relevant including more nonfinancial information on entity performance they also vowed to streamline the accounting standardsetting process to make it more responsive to the rapid changes that occur in a technologydriven economy since the enron debacle the aicpa has been engaged in significant damage control measures to restore confidence in the profession displaying the banner “enron the aicpa the profession and the public interest” on its web site it has announced the imminent issuance of an exposure draft on a new audit standard on fraud the third in five years providing more specific guidance than currently found in sas no  consideration of fraud in a financial statement audit the institute has also promised a revised standard on reviews of quarterly financial statements as well as the issuance in the second quarter of  of an exposure draft of a standard to improve the audit process these standards had already been on the drawing board as part of the aicpa’s response to the report of the blue ribbon panel on audit effectiveness issued in  in late december the aicpa issued a tool kit for auditors to use in identifying and auditing related party transactions while it breaks no new ground the tool kit provides in one place an overview of the accounting and auditing literature sec requirements and best practice guidance concerning related party transactions it also includes checklists and other tools for auditors to use in gathering evidence and disclosing related party transactions in january the aicpa board of directors announced that it would cooperate fully with the sec’s proposal for new rules for the peer review and disciplinary process for cpa firms of sec registrants the new system would be managed by a board a majority of which would be public members enhancing the peer review process for the largest firms and requiring more rigorous and continuous monitoring the staff of the new board would administer the reviews in protest the public oversight board informed pitt that it would terminate its existence in march  leaving the future peer review process in a state of uncertainty the sec and the aicpa are now engaged in talks with the pob to reassure the board it will continue to be a vital part of the peer review process in the future the aicpa has also approved a resolution to support prohibitions that would prevent audit firms from performing systems design and implementation as well as internal audit outsourcing for public audit clients while asserting that it does not believe prohibition of these services will make audits more effective or prevent financial failures the board has stated it feels the move is necessary to restore public confidence in the profession these prohibitions were at the center of the controversy last year between the profession and the sec under the direction of former chairman arthur levitt big five cpa firms and the aicpa lobbied heavily and prevailed in that controversy winning the right to retain these services and being required only to disclose their fees the impact of enron is now being felt at the highest levels of government as legislators engage in endless debate and accusation quarreling over the influence of money in politics the gao has requested that the white house disclose documents concerning appointments to president george w bush’s task force on energy chaired by vicepresident dick cheney former ceo of halliburton the white house has refused and the gao has filed suit the first of its kind in history congressional investigations are expected to continue well into  and beyond lawmakers are expected to investigate not only disclosure practices at enron but for all public companies concerning spes related party transactions and use of “marktomarket” accounting kenneth lay resigned as enron’s ceo under pressure from creditor groups lay skilling and fastow still have much to explain in addition enron’s board of directors and especially the audit committee will be in the “hot seat” and rightfully so the justice department opened a criminal investigation and formed a national task force made up of federal prosecutors in houston san francisco new york and several other cities to investigate the possibility of fraud in the company’s dealings interestingly to illustrate how farreaching enron’s ties are to government and political sources at all levels us attorney general john ashcroft as well as his entire houston office disqualified themselves from the investigation because of either political economic or family ties it appears that  is shaping up to be a year of unprecedented changes for a profession that is already coping with an identity crisis where were the auditors arthur andersen llp after settling two other massive lawsuits earlier in  is preparing for a storm of litigation as well as a possible criminal investigation in the wake of the enron collapse enron was the firm’s secondlargest client andersen who had the job not only of enron’s external but also its internal audits for the years in question kept a staff on permanent assignment at enron’s offices many of enron’s internal accountants cfos and controllers were former andersen executives because of these relationships as well as andersen’s extensive concurrent consulting practice members of congress the press and others are calling andersen’s audit independence into question indeed they are using the case to raise doubts about the credibility of the audit process for all big five firms who do such work so far andersen has acknowledged its role in the fiasco while defending its accounting and auditing practices in a wall street journal editorial on december  as well as in testimony before congress the following week joseph berardino ceo was forthright in his views he committed the firm to full cooperation in the investigations as well as to a leadership role in potential solutions enron dismissed andersen as its auditor on january   citing document destruction and lack of guidance on accounting policy issues as the reasons andersen countered with the contention that in its mind the relationship had terminated on december   the day the firm filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the fact that andersen is no longer officially associated with enron will unfortunately have little impact on forces now in place that may in the eyes of some determine the firm’s very future andersen is now under formal investigation by the sec as well as various committees of both the us senate and house of representatives of the us congress to make matters worse for it and to the astonishment of many andersen admitted it destroyed perhaps thousands of documents and electronic files related to the engagement in accordance with “firm policy” supposedly before the sec issued a subpoena for them the firm’s lawyers issued an internal memorandum on october  reminding employees of the firm’s document retention and destruction policies the firm fired david b duncan partner in charge of the enron engagement placed four other partners on leave and replaced the entire management team of the houston office duncan invoked his fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination at a congressional hearing in january several other andersen partners testified that duncan and his staff acted in violation of firm policy however in view of the timing of the october  memorandum congress and the press are questioning whether the decision to shred documents extended farther up the chain of command andersen has suspended its firm policy for retention of records and asked former us senator john danforth to conduct a comprehensive review of the firm’s records management policy and to recommend improvements in a move to bolster its image andersen also has retained former federal reserve chairman paul volcker to lead an outside board that will advise it in making “fundamental change” in its audit process other members of the board include p roy vagelos former chairman and ceo of merck  co and charles a bowsher current chairman of the public oversight board which disbanded in march volcker also named a sevenmember advisory panel made up of prominent corporate and accounting executives that will review proposed reforms to the firm’s audit process hindsight is so clear that it sometimes belies the complexity of the problem although fraud has not yet been proven to be a factor in enron’s misstatements some of the classic risk factors associated with management fraud outlined in sas no  are evident in the enron case those include management characteristics industry conditions and operating characteristics of the company although written five years ago the list almost looks as if it was excerpted from enron’s case unduly aggressive earnings targets and management bonus compensation based on those targets excessive interest by management in maintaining stock price or earnings trend through the use of unusually aggressive accounting practices management setting unduly aggressive financial targets and expectations for operating personnel inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations while reporting earnings and earnings growth assets liabilities revenues or expenses based on significant estimates that involve unusually subjective judgments such as…reliability of financial instruments significant related party transactions these factors are common threads in the tapestry that is described of the environment leading to fraud they were incorporated into sas no  on the basis of research into fraud cases of the s and s in the hope that auditors would learn from the past andersen will have to explain when and how it identified these factors as well as how it responded and how it communicated with enron’s board about them more important andersen will have to explain why it delayed notifying the sec after learning of the internal enron memo warning of problems in addition it will have to explain why the houston office destroyed the thousands of documents related to the enron audits for  through  only time will tell but it appears the firm is in serious trouble in the end and also characteristic of cases like this the chief parties likely to benefit from this process are the attorneys the human factor the enron story has produced many victims the most tragic of which is a former vicechairman of the company who committed suicide apparently in connection with his role in the scandal another  individuals have seen their careers ended abruptly by the reckless acts of a few enron’s core values of respect integrity communication and excellence stand in satirical contrast to allegations now being made public personally i had referred several of our best and brightest accounting finance and mba graduates to enron hoping they could gain valuable experience from seeing things done right these included a very bright training consultant who had lost her job in  with a houston consulting firm as a result of a reduction in force she has lost her second job in  months through no fault of her own other former students still hanging on at enron face an uncertain future as the company fights for survival the old saying goes “lessons learned hard are learned best” some former enron employees are embittered by the way they have been treated by the company that was once “the best in the business” others disagree in the words of one of my former students who is still hanging on “just for the record my time and experience at enron have been nothing short of fantastic i could not have asked for a better place to be or better people to work with please though remember this never take customer and employee confidence for granted that confidence is easy to lose and tough—to impossible—to regain”  c
