tech entrepreneurship your money farley sticking to formula by stephen phillips special to the new york times published april   chicago april — william f farley who turned a  investment into a  billion empire in less than  years likes to talk in the jargon of baseball mr farley a yearold partowner of the chicago white sox rates one of his less successful deals the condec corporation as a single and boasts how his  billion acquisition last year of northwest industries has home run potential in his eagerness to pile up runs for farley industries the umbrella organization for his holdings he is willing to make an occasional sacrifice play various operations have been sold and inventory adjustments have been made to improve overall performance even though the moves have produced lower revenues and losses for example farleynorthwest industries the name mr farley gave to chicagobased northwest lost  million last year after earning  million a year earlier condec a maker of electronic controls acquired in  has lost more than  million in the last two years while it was also suffering declines in sales there are those who see some perils in the farley situation things are pretty tight said steven brooks a senior analyst with moodys investor services which recently downgraded the senior debt ratings on both farleynorthwest and condec because of their heavy debt given how leveraged up he is he doesnt have a lot of leeway but mr farley argues that the right moves are being made if youre private he said you dont try to maximize reported earnings were hardly under water the trim tan executive said in the spacious headquarters in the sears tower that he and his corporate staff of  inherited with the northwest deal we just paid off millions of dollars of bank debt also company officials have indicated that an announcement of a major restructuring involving condec will be made soon some moves are praised most analysts agree with mr farley that his pruning of northwest in particular has been worthwhile among the moves he has made are taking a  million loss on the sale of the pogo producing company an oil and gas exploration company and selling for  million the agrichemical division of the troubled velsicol chemical corporation he plans to sell the small remaining portion of velsicol by the end of the year what remains in the northwest unit are one stellar business  union underwear which markets under the fruit of the loom and bvd labels  and two solid but less impressive operations  the general battery corporation the nations secondlargest maker of replacement batteries for cars and acme boot whose products include the dingo footwear line a slimmer northwest beefed up by increased spending for such things as advertising has considerable profit potential according to leon d black a managing director at drexel burnham lambert inc the picture had been cloudy because of velsicol he said but with the asset sales the numbers have already improved in a short period what remains at northwest he said is a future that looks very good two leading brands with fruit of the loom and bvd union controls  percent of the massmerchandise underwear market the unit had  sales of  million and operating income of about  million generating about  percent of the northwest units operating income analysts say union has a strong history fruit of the loom did to mens underwear what hanes did to ladies nylons said w dudley herr an analyst with duff  phelps they marketed underwear away from department stores to just about any retail outlet  grocery stores five and dimes you name it and it is here that mr farley has his biggest plans hoping to capitalize on its distribution base farley will begin to strongly promote womens underwear as well as add mens and womens socks and sweatshirts to unions product line later this year according to mr farleys estimates socks and sweatshirts will add about  million in sales in  increasing unions product line will not be easy cautioned w dudley herr an analyst at duff  phelps stores just dont give a lot of play to fruit of the loom products now he said how hes going to get places like k mart to clear even more shelf space is anybodys guess if union is the strongest part of the farley empire analysts say condec is the weak spot in  he bought the  percent of condec that he did not own for  million for the year ending in july  the latest figures available condec had a loss of  million on revenues of  million in  it lost  million mr farley said condec was not very healthy when he purchased it  an assertion that is disputed by some former condec officials a pentagon investigation the condec troubles have not been limited to finances condiesel a unit has been the target of a  million department of defense overcharge investigation to make matters worse its largest contract carriage assemblies for howitzer armored vehicles expired this month   next page

chief judge and cummings and cudahy circuit judges cummings circuit judge in january  the united states filed a complaint alleging that william f farley violated section a of the clayton act  usc § a commonly called the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act hsr act the complaint alleges that on march   farley failed to notify the department of justice and the federal trade commission ftc when his purchases of the stock of west pointpepperell inc west point exceeded  million the point at which the reporting requirements of the hsr act contained in  usc § aab are triggered the violation allegedly extended for  days until june   in accordance with  usc § ag the government sought a civil penalty of  the maximum daily civil penalty for violating the hsr act reporting requirements the district court dismissed the governments complaint with prejudice when in response to a district court order the government declined to produce nine internal ftc documents it alleged were protected by the work product and deliberative process privileges the documents in question have recently been submitted to us for in camera review we reverse statute the hsr act prohibits anyone with substantial assets or sales from acquiring voting securities from another firm with substantial assets or sales if the acquisition would result in the purchaser holding at least  million of that firms voting securities unless a the purchaser first notifies the department of justice and the ftc and b complies with the statutory waiting period of  days for a cash tender offer  days for other transactions and  days in the case of bankruptcy filings  usc § aa b there is an exemption for acquisitions of voting securities solely for the purpose of investment if they do not exceed  of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer  usc § ac the notification requirements are intended to give antitrust enforcement agencies an opportunity to identify transactions that might violate section a of the clayton act  usc § a facts in  defendant farley was the majority stockholder and chief executive officer of farley inc a holding company then engaged in the apparel footwear and precision metals businesses the principal executive office of farley inc a delaware corporation is located in chicago in february of  farley inc borrowed  million through drexel burnham lambert incorporated of this sum  million was to pay off existing debt and the balance was to be invested in inter alia equity securities and possible acquisition candidates on march   farley began purchasing west point stock and the value of that stock passed  million on march   farley made no hsr filing at that time but continued to purchase west point stock on april  he held almost  of the west point stock whose value was then about  million farley thus exceeded the hsr reporting threshold by approximately  million on may   farley filed an hsr act premerger notification report seeking to acquire  of west point stock the hsr waiting period expired on june   without the federal trade commission or the department of justice seeking additional information on october   farley made a second hsr act filing seeking approval to purchase up to  of west point voting securities the waiting period under the act expired on november  again without any action by federal enforcement agencies on april   farley completed his acquisition of west point this suit concerns only his march   failure to report the purchase of  million of west point stock in contravention of  usc § aab complaint by justice department in early  the ftc commenced investigating whether farley violated the hsr acts reporting and waiting period requirements when he passed the  million west point stock threshold on march   thereafter the ftc recommended that the department of justice bring this action against farley for violating the hsr act as a result this suit was filed on february   seeking recovery of a  statutory penalty under  usc § ag farleys answer claimed among other defenses that he was not required to report his march and april  west point purchases because they fell within the investmentonly exemption contained in the hsr act which exempts acquisitions solely for the purpose of investment of voting securities if as a result of such acquisition the securities acquired or held do not exceed  percent of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer  usc § ac after the ftc had recommended to the justice department that this suit be brought but before the complaint was filed raymond randall — an ftc attorney who had worked on the investigation — without the permission of the ftc delivered internal ftc documents relating to the farley investigation to one of farleys law firms that firms ethics counsel returned the original documents to the ftc but retained copies after the complaint was filed farley demanded production of  years worth of ftc and department of justice files relating to the interpretation and application of the investmentonly exemption in the hsr act  usc § ac this request covered over  documents and attachments shortly thereafter farley requested the documents that ftc attorney randall had improperly released the government produced all documents relating to the investmentonly exemption and the farley investigation over  documents except  documents and attachments the ftc alleged were protected by the work product and deliberative process privileges the  documents withheld included most of the documents wrongfully disclosed by randall the district judge referred this and other open discovery matters to magistrate judge lefkow farley moved to compel the production of all documents not yet produced relating among other things to the investigation of his acquisitions including any communications with west point or its counsel after reviewing the disputed documents in camera the magistrate judge ordered certain of them be disclosed to farley the government filed objections to magistrate judge lefkows decision as to nine of the documents identified on the governments privilege log as numbers b b b d c b  b a again relying on the work product and deliberative process privileges the nine documents included memoranda of ftc staff members and discussions of the farley matter as well as documents containing the ftc staffs views on the investmentonly exemption and recommendations for future action without inspecting the disputed documents judge duff refused to overturn the magistrate judges disclosure order because of his expressed confidence in her ruling consequently in accordance with the procedure approved in united states v procter  gamble co  us    sct    ledd  the government suggested dismissal of the case solely in order to obtain appellate review thereafter the action was dismissed with prejudice on january   and this appeal subsequently was filed analysis a deliberative process and work product privileges the magistrate judge ruled that the documents in question were covered by the deliberative process or work product privilege but that the documents should nonetheless be disclosed the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the decisionmaking process of a governmental agency nlrb v sears roebuck  co  us    sct    ledd  since frank discussion of legal and policy matters is essential to the decisionmaking process of a governmental agency communications made prior to and as a part of an agency determination are protected from disclosure id at   sct at  communications made subsequent to an agency decision are however not similarly protected id at   sct at  the deliberative process privilege may be overcome where there is a sufficient showing of a particularized need to outweigh the reasons for confidentiality cf coastal states gas corp v department of energy  fd   dccir the privilege should be applied as narrowly as consistent with efficient government operation black v sheraton corp of america  fd   dccir after examining the documents this court concludes that the documents were clearly part of the deliberative process leading to the decision to sue document no c is the referral memorandum from the ftc staff to the department of justice having been rendered prior to the departments decision to bring an action against farley the document is within the departments deliberative process privilege since the document was predecisional and deliberative the fact that the document passed from one agency to another does not terminate its privileged status renegotiation board v grumman aircraft engineering corp  us    sct    ledd  bureau of natl affairs inc v united states dept of justice  fd   dccir the other disputed documents are staff memoranda to senior agency officials with recommendations legal interpretations and drafts of litigation documents documents clearly part of the ftcs deliberations on the farley matter and therefore exempt from production formaldehyde institute v department of health  human services  fd   dccir  collecting cases the deliberative process extends to these predecisional communications — if communications such as these were exposed the candor of government staff would be tempered with a concern for appearances    to the detriment of the decisionmaking process united states v nixon  us    sct    ledd  sears roebuck  us at   sct at  moreover since the documents reflect an agencys preliminary positions about how to exercise discretion on a policy they are privileged petroleum information corp v united states dept of interior  fd   dccir since the documents at issue are within the scope of the deliberative process privilege the government could only be required to produce them if farley made a showing that his need for the documents outweighed the governments interest in not disclosing them coastal states gas corp  fd at  black  fd at  farley however has never shown such a particularized need farleys only assertion of need was his claim that they are relevant and generally important to his affirmative defenses yet relevance alone is an insufficient reason for breaching the deliberative process privilege it was essential that the magistrate judge balance farleys particularized need for the documents against their nature and the effect of disclosure on the government this balancing was never done instead the magistrate judge merely determined that the documents were relevant to farleys defense and ordered their disclosure since the required balancing was not done the documents should not have been ordered to be produced the magistrate judge also held the work product privilege epitomized in hickman v taylor  us   sct   led  applied to certain documents but nevertheless ordered disclosure to assist defendants defense documents protected by the work product privilege however need only be disclosed upon a showing of substantial need id at   sct at  fedrcivp b it does not appear from the record that such a substantial need was ever shown b relevance although this court believes that the magistrate failed to determine properly whether farley had shown sufficient need to overcome the two privileges we need not remand this case for such a determination since the documents at issue are not relevant to the controversy before us farley cannot as a matter of law make a showing of need the federal rules of civil procedure contemplate broad discovery permitting discovery regarding any matter not privileged which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action fedrcivp b emphasis supplied the rules of discovery are however not broad enough to require the discovery of the material here at issue the discovery proposed here is not relevant to the issue presented by the governments complaint whether farley was required to report on march   that his holdings in west point had exceeded the  million threshold to resolve this issue the court need only compare farleys acquisitions and filings to the hsr acts reporting requirements nor is the proposed discovery relevant to any of farleys affirmative defenses farleys affirmative defenses are  that the governments complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted  that the complaint is barred by the doctrine of estoppel because farley relied to his detriment on the ftcs then existing public interpretations of the investmentonly exemption  that farleys purchases were exempt from hsr act requirements under the investmentonly exemption  that the ftc regulation defining the exemption  cfr §  is impermissibly vague  that enforcement of that regulation would be arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act and  that farley had no notice that the investmentonly exemption would not apply to his initial acquisitions the ftc documents are definitely not relevant to farleys claim that his purchases fell within the investmentonly exemption to the hsr acts reporting requirements this defense requires only that the district court interpret the statutory exemption and determine whether farleys purchases were within the scope of that exemption the suppositions of ftc staff members expressed in internal memoranda as to requirements of the act are not pertinent to this task in its attempt to decipher the meaning of a statute a court may rely on various tools including official agency interpretations chevron usa v natural resources defense council  us    sct    ledd  courts may not however rely on unpublished opinions of agency staff international paper co v federal power commn  fd   d cir certiorari denied  us   sct   ledd  views of individual members of the agencys staff are not legally germane the documents at issue here clearly fall in the latter category and as such are not germane to the courts inquiry similarly the documents at issue have no bearing on farleys claim that the government is estopped from pursuing the interpretation of the investmentonly exemption urged by the ftc because farley supposedly relied to his detriment on the agencys previously announced interpretations of the hsr act the merit of this defense turns not on the substance of intraagency communications but on the content of publicly articulated policy the views of agency employees contained in intraagency documents are not however expressions of ftc policy id rather they are part of the exchange of ideas—the give and take—central to the formulation of such policy farleys detrimental reliance claim therefore is not a basis for admitting the documents in question nor do any of farleys other defenses provide a basis for discovery the ftcs internal documents are not relevant to farleys claim that the ftc regulation defining the investmentonly exemption  cfr §  is impermissibly vague this is a matter of statutory interpretation and constitutional analysis a process which does not require the court to review the postulations of agency staff members as to the meaning of the investmentonly exemption the ftc documents are also not relevant to farleys contention that the government has failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted —this is a question of law on which the ftc documents can shed no light nor are the documents relevant to farleys claim that the ftcs regulations did not provide adequate notice that he was required to report his initial west point investments since the documents in question were for intraagency use and not general distribution they reveal nothing about the adequacy of the public notice provided by the regulations postpublication discourse among ftc staff about the meaning of the hsr regulations is irrelevant to the central issue of this defense— determining whether farley should after reading the regulations have understood that his purchases did not fall within the definition of the investmentonly exemption set out therein to resolve this question the court need look only to the language of the regulation and any official public interpretations of it cf international paper co  fd at  farleys remaining defense is that the application of  cfr §  to his acquisitions constitutes arbitrary and capricious action in violation of the administrative procedures act apa  usc §  judicial review under the apa is of official agency action  usc §  comments made in internal ftc documents are not official agency actions and therefore not legally relevant to a courts review under the apa conclusion this courts inspection of the documents at issue shows that they were clearly covered by the deliberative process and work product privileges ordering their disclosure without a proper assessment of farleys need for the documents was an error moreover as the documents are as a matter of law not relevant to the present controversy a showing of sufficient need is not possible consequently the disclosure and dismissal orders were erroneous reversed and remanded footnotes  farley and farley inc are used interchangeably herein because defendant was the ultimate parent entity of farley inc as defined in  cfr §  and was the person responsible for the notifications required by the hsr act  cfr § a  farleys other defenses are set out infra p  the district judge denied plaintiffs motion to strike some of the six affirmative defenses as insufficiently pled under fedrcivp  but postponed a determination of whether the defenses were legally sufficient joint app  indicating that defenses might be struck for legal insufficiency in a motion for summary judgment or some other proceeding later in the case  farley appears to believe that the magistrate judges order covers more than these nine documents that dispute need not be resolved since the issues underlying the magistrate judges order are the same for all documents in dispute  we note that it is unclear whether the ftc has taken any action with regard to farley that is reviewable under the apa the apa provides for judicial review of final agency action  usc §  defined to include an agency rule order license sanction relief or the equivalent or denial thereof or failure to act  usc §  the only action taken by the ftc with regard to farley was its referral of his case to the department of justice and this referral may not be a final agency action but merely a threshold determination that further inquiry is warranted  ftc v standard oil of california  us    sct    ledd  it is also unclear whether the district court presently has jurisdiction over a challenge to an action taken by the ftc since the ftc is not a party to this action this court will not resolve these issues here since we believe that regardless of the outcome of those issues farley does not have a right to discover the documents in question however so that further relevancy and discovery problems can be minimized the district court judge should determine whether this— and any other defenses—should be

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object
