approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a

immunocal with two additional components added cmp and rmf what is cmp cmp stands for cytokine modulating proteins cytokines are small biologically active proteins that act as signals in the immune system to regulate inflammation what is rmf rmf stands for redox modulating formula developed by dr wulf droge rmf includes a proprietary blend of citrate minerals which act to lower acidity levels in the body and to restore its natural ph balance this serves to support the strength of bones as we age and contributes to your overall wellbeing rmf also includes a very small amount of creatine which helps to maintain proper muscle function if someone is lactose intolerant can they take immunocal platinum yes the lactose in immunocal platinum is removed during its production less than  lactose remains and legally the product can be called lactosefree it should be noted that being lactoseintolerant is different than having a milk protein allergy see below if someone has a milk allergy can they take immunocal platinum most people who claim they have a milk allergy are actually not allergic they are lactose intolerant if this is the case they can take immunocal platinum if they have a true allergy to milk proteins they should avoid it however the majority of milk protein allergies  are to a protein called caseine there is very little caseine in immunocal platinum generally less than  can immunocal platinum be mixed with immunocal immunocal regular and immunocal platinum can be mixed together if desired what is whey whey is a group of proteins found in milk what is a whey protein isolate whey proteins can be produced in different concentrations regular whey protein can be anywhere from  to  whey protein concentrates are between  and  a whey protein isolate is over  pure protein technically this is difficult and expensive to achieve without harming the proteins structure why is a whey protein isolate desirable only isolates have thoroughly removed from them the fat fatsoluble toxins water watersoluble toxins lactose and other contaminants from the protein it is the purest form of protein there are other whey protein isolates on the market how is immunocal platinum different immunocal is supported with extensive research published in medical journals immunocal is produced in a special way to preserve the proteins natural structure so that it retains its profound effect on your cells immunocal is clinically proven to work in human beings immunocal appears in the american pdr physicians desk reference immunocal appears in the canadian cps compendium of pharmaceuticals and specialties how does the manufacture of immunocal platinum differ from other whey proteins immunotecs proprietary manufacturing process preserves the critical disulfide bonds in the glutathione precursor cysteine by delivering this delicate protein to the cell it enables the body to create glutathione and maximize immune system levels other whey proteins are often manufactured using high heat pasteurization and harsh methods of mixing resulting in a denatured and ineffective product what does undenatured mean undenatured means that a protein is not damaged or significantly changed from the way it appears in nature immunocal platinum works by providing important glutathione precursors to the cell it is critical that these precursors remain intact or undenatured during the manufacturing and mixing processes in order to enhance the immune system that is why we recommend that immunocal platinum not be heated or subject to harsh mixing in order to preserve it bioactivity do other whey protein isolates work as a source of amino acids whey protein has a superior nutritional advantage over other types of protein all whey protein isolates are a good source of protein however there are many other variables that need to be considered in a wheys quality most importantly is the degree in which the protein resembles its original form in nature this is easily altered in the harvesting manufacturing packaging storage and shipping and quality control of the product other whey protein isolates have not been thoroughly tested in clinical trials done on human beings so its anybodys guess as to whether they work or not what does immunocal platinum do immunocal platinum is a natural source of the glutathione precursor cysteine for the maintenance of a strong immune system and helps to maintain proper muscle function and bone health by reducing calcium loss how does immunocal platinum work immunocal platinum supplies the rare building blocks precursors for your cells to make glutathione immunocal platinum supplies all the essential amino acids required by your cells and tissues immunocal platinum supplies other peptides small proteins critical for many aspects of your health what is glutathione it is a substance that is produced by your own cells that is fundamental to life glutathione plays many roles the most important of which are it is your bodys master antioxidant gsh plays a determinant role in the proper functioning of the immune system why cant a person just eat glutathione glutathione is broken down by digestion and very little if any can get from your mouth to your cell where its needed to raise glutathione effectively you must give your cells the building blocks precursors to make glutathione yourself how have the benefits of immunocal platinum been proven how do we know it works immunocal has had research performed starting as far back as the late s at mcgill university canadas foremost medical school there continues to be much effort in publishing human clinical trials in respected peerreviewed medical journals worldwide these articles are easily available online what is a peerreviewed journal peerreviewed means that an article is scrutinized and criticized for quality and validity by other doctors and scientists before it can be published articles that dont stand up to this scrutiny are rejected most submissions are initially rejected this screens for misguided or inaccurate statements how many articles have been published about immunocal this is a moving target that grows every year as of summer  there have been over  articles published what are the pdr and cps the american pdr physicians desk reference and the canadian cps compendium of pharmaceuticals and specialties are published yearly and distributed to all the doctors and pharmacists in the country it holds all the prescribing information for drugs however immunocal platinum is not a drug it is one of the rare natural substances that hold a position in these publications there are other whey protein isolates that claim to have research as well true when this research is actually examined usually you will find that they are quoting work done by dr bounous kongshavn droge or other prominent scientists done on immunocal this does not mean that their products work as well they are experiments done in a laboratory or on laboratory animals not in human beings who can not take immunocal platinum anyone with a specific allergy to the components this does not include lactose immunocal contains less than  lactose it is usually tolerated by lactoseintolerant individuals anyone taking immunosuppressant medication to avoid rejection of an organ transplant always ask your health professional before taking any supplements can pregnant or lactating women take immunocal platinum no adverse effects have been reported a health care practitioner should be consulted prior to use if the person is pregnant or has reason to believe she is or if she is breastfeeding can geriatric clients take immunocal platinum yes glutathione levels drop with age are there side effects immunocal platinum is a natural source of protein classified as a natural health product gastrointestinal bloating and cramps are possible if the product is not sufficiently rehydrated transient urticariallike skin rash has been reported in rare individuals undergoing severe detoxification reaction skin rash abates when the intake is stopped or reduced can you overdose on immunocal platinum there have been no reports of toxicity from overdosing on immunocal platinum glutathione is a tightly regulated intracellular constituent and is limited in its production by negative feedback inhibition of its own synthesis through the enzyme gammaglutamylcysteine synthetase thus greatly minimizing any possibility of overdose are there liquids that can not be used to mix with immunocal platinum avoid hot liquids and extremely acidic liquids can i use a blender to mix immunocal platinum power blenders should generally be avoided small lowspeed handheld plastic blenders are acceptable how long is immunocal platinum good for once it has been mixed as a general guideline consume shortly after mixing preferably within  minutes it is best kept cool while waiting can immunocal platinum be mixed with milk immunocal platinum can be mixed with milk but may taste salty or sour in milk this is why the label recommends not mixing with milk however if you like the taste it is not a problem when is the best time to take immunocal platinum most people take immunocal platinum first thing in the morning or after your body has been fasting for a few hours this will enhance protein absorption and amino acid utilization if you are taking multiple pouches per day these can be taken at separate times if i am taking several pouches of immunocal platinum per day can i take them all at once yes does immunocal contain any pesticides or antibiotic immunocal platinum does not contain antibiotics or pesticide residues is there any danger of mad cow disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse no because of concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse the cattle are continuously surveyed for evidence of the disease immunotec platinum herds also fully participate in the federal mammalian protein feeding ban feeding the cows with proteins of ruminants is prohibited the united states immunocal is certified free of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse how should immunocal platinum be stored immunocal platinum should be stored in a cool dry place to maximize shelflife and preserve efficacy we suggest temperatures of °f °c how much raw milk does it take to make immunocal platinum we need  liters  us gallons of fresh raw milk to produce  kilogram  lbs of immunocal platinum it is produced using a gentle process and low temperatures to preserve the biological activity of the proteins what is the difference between taking immunocal platinum as opposed to taking other antioxidants immunocal platinum as such is not an antioxidant but provides the building blocks for the synthesis of glutathione which is the principal intracellular antioxidant immunocal platinum also contains cmp and rmf the story of immunocal immunocal mixing instructions immunocal strength and performance flyer

having a milk protein allergy see below if someone has a milk allergy can they take immunocal most people who claim they have a milk allergy are actually not allergic they are lactose intolerant if this is the case they can take immunocal if they have a true allergy to milk proteins they should avoid it however the majority of milk protein allergies  are to a protein called caseine there is very little caseine in immunocal generally less than  what is whey whey is a group of proteins found in milk what is a whey protein isolate whey proteins can be produced in different concentrations regular whey protein can be anywhere from  to  whey protein concentrates are between  and  a whey protein isolate is over  pure protein technically this is difficult and expensive to achieve without harming the proteins structure why is a whey protein isolate desirable only isolates have thoroughly removed from them the fat fatsoluble toxins water watersoluble toxins lactose and other contaminants from the protein it is the purest form of protein there are other whey protein isolates on the market how is immunocal different immunocal is supported with extensive research published in medical journals immunocal is produced in a special way to preserve the proteins natural structure so that it retains its profound effect on your cells immunocal is clinically proven to work in human beings immunocal appears in the american pdr physicians desk reference immunocal appears in the canadian cps compendium of pharmaceuticals and specialties how does the manufacture of immunocal differ from other whey proteins immunotecs proprietary manufacturing process preserves the critical disulfide bonds in the glutathione precursor cysteine by delivering this delicate protein to the cell it enables the body to create glutathione and maximize immune system levels other whey proteins are often manufactured using high heat pasteurization and harsh methods of mixing resulting in a denatured and ineffective product what does undenatured mean undenatured means that a protein is not damaged or significantly changed from the way it appears in nature immunocal works by providing important glutathione precursors to the cell it is critical that these precursors remain intact or undenatured during the manufacturing and mixing processes in order to enhance the immune system that is why we recommend that immunocal not be heated or subject to harsh mixing in order to preserve it bioactivity do other whey protein isolates work as a source of amino acids whey protein has a superior nutritional advantage over other types of protein all whey protein isolates are a good source of protein however there are many other variables that need to be considered in a wheys quality most importantly is the degree in which the protein resembles its original form in nature this is easily altered in the harvesting manufacturing packaging storage and shipping and quality control of the product other whey protein isolates have not been thoroughly tested in clinical trials done on human beings so its anybodys guess as to whether they work or not what does immunocal do immunocal is a natural source of the glutathione precursor cysteine for the maintenance of a strong immune system how does immunocal work immunocal supplies the rare building blocks precursors for your cells to make glutathione immunocal supplies all the essential amino acids required by your cells and tissues immunocal supplies other peptides small proteins critical for many aspects of your health what is glutathione it is a substance that is produced by your own cells that is fundamental to life glutathione plays many roles the most important of which are it is your bodys master antioxidant gsh plays a determinant role in the proper functioning of the immune system why cant a person just eat glutathione glutathione is broken down by digestion and very little if any can get from your mouth to your cell where its needed to raise glutathione effectively you must give your cells the building blocks precursors to make glutathione yourself how have the benefits of immunocal been proven how do we know it works immunocal has had research performed starting as far back as the late s at mcgill university canadas foremost medical school there continues to be much effort in publishing human clinical trials in respected peerreviewed medical journals worldwide these articles are easily available online what is a peerreviewed journal peerreviewed means that an article is scrutinized and criticized for quality and validity by other doctors and scientists before it can be published articles that dont stand up to this scrutiny are rejected most submissions are initially rejected this screens for misguided or inaccurate statements how many articles have been published about immunocal this is a moving target that grows every year as of summer  there have been over  articles published what are the pdr and cps the american pdr physicians desk reference and the canadian cps compendium of pharmaceuticals and specialties are published yearly and distributed to all the doctors and pharmacists in the country it holds all the prescribing information for drugs however immunocal is not a drug it is one of the rare natural substances that hold a position in these publications there are other whey protein isolates that claim to have research as well true when this research is actually examined usually you will find that they are quoting work done by dr bounous kongshavn droge or other prominent scientists done on immunocal this does not mean that their products work as well they are experiments done in a laboratory or on laboratory animals not in human beings who can not take immunocal anyone with a specific allergy to the components this does not include lactose immunocal contains less than  lactose it is usually tolerated by lactoseintolerant individuals anyone taking immunosuppressant medication to avoid rejection of an organ transplant always ask your health professional before taking any supplements can pregnant or lactating women take immunocal no adverse effects have been reported a health care practitioner should be consulted prior to use if the person is pregnant or has reason to believe she is or if she is breastfeeding can geriatric clients take immunocal yes glutathione levels drop with age are there side effects immunocal is a natural source of protein classified as a natural health product gastrointestinal bloating and cramps are possible if the product is not sufficiently rehydrated transient urticariallike skin rash has been reported in rare individuals undergoing severe detoxification reaction skin rash abates when the intake is stopped or reduced can you overdose on immunocal there have been no reports of toxicity from overdosing on immunocal glutathione is a tightly regulated intracellular constituent and is limited in its production by negative feedback inhibition of its own synthesis through the enzyme gammaglutamylcysteine synthetase thus greatly minimizing any possibility of overdose what is the pediatric dosage for immunocal pediatric immunocal dose by approximate weight of child weight lbs weight kg dose pouch dose g dose ml dose tbs dose tsp                                           are there liquids that can not be used to mix with immunocal avoid hot liquids and extremely acidic liquids can i use a blender to mix immunocal power blenders should generally be avoided small lowspeed handheld plastic blenders are acceptable how long is immunocal good for once it has been mixed as a general guideline consume shortly after mixing preferably within  minutes it is best kept cool while waiting can immunocal be mixed with milk immunocal can be mixed with milk immunocal platinum can be mixed with milk but may taste salty or sour in milk when is the best time to take immunocal most people take immunocal first thing in the morning or after your body has been fasting for a few hours this will enhance protein absorption and amino acid utilization if you are taking multiple pouches per day these can be taken at separate times if i am taking several pouches of immunocal per day can i take them all at once yes does immunocal contain any additives the product is additivefree the sole ingredient is whey protein isolate does immunocal contain any animal products immunocal is completely of dairy origin and does not contain any other animal derived materials does immunocal contain any pesticides or antibiotic immunocal does not contain antibiotics or pesticide residues is there any danger of mad cow disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse no because of concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse the cattle are continuously surveyed for evidence of the disease immunotec herds also fully participate in the federal mammalian protein feeding ban feeding the cows with proteins of ruminants is prohibited the united states immunocal is certified free of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse how should immunocal be stored immunocal should be stored in a cool dry place to maximize shelflife and preserve integrity we suggest temperatures of °f °c how much raw milk does it take to make immunocal we need  liters  us gallons of fresh raw milk to produce  kilogram  lbs of immunocal it is produced using a gentle process and low temperatures to preserve the biological activity of the proteins what is the difference between taking immunocal as opposed to taking other antioxidants immunocal as such is not an antioxidant but provides the building blocks for the synthesis of glutathione which is the principal intracellular antioxidant the story of immunocal immunocal
