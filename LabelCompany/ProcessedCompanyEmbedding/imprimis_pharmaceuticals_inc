lows after near term financing overhang removed company brings value to healthcare system doctors and patients in a unique manner ophthalmology product launches and growth in currently commercialized products should continue to spur revenue growth monetisation of unique drug formulations could significantly impact balance sheet risks include execution in product launches and gaining market share as well as competition and delayed profitability shares of tiny life sciences firm imprimis pharmaceuticals nasdaqimmy have finished the past year with flat performance although the stock price has rebounded over  from recent lows immy data by ycharts background management is currently focused on opportunities in ophthalmology  of current revenue mix although realize significant sales in the areas of integrative medicine  and urology  through their compounding pharmacies the company offers high quality drug formulations that address unmet patient needs at lower costs without sacrificing quality figure  no reliance on middle men transparent business model source corporate presentation the company has over  ophthalmologist customers and growing as well as over  patents and pending patents theyve experienced  quarters of consecutive revenue growth with over  of revenues being cashbased figure  quarterly revenues growing significantly led by ophthalmology sales source corporate presentation ophthalmology opportunity the company has an impressive ophthalmology development pipeline with the impact of already commercialized products such as lessdrops combination drops clearly visible in financial results figure  impressive ophthalmology pipeline with several launches in  source corporate presentation the success of lessdrops can be seen in lower volumes of sales in market leaders such as alcons vigamox and allergans pred forte lessdrops are the perfect example of how the companys treatments benefit our healthcare system as they cost  versus an average of  for standard of care eye drops and  less drop applications are needed figure  eye drop market leaders unit volumes since lessdrops launch source corporate presentation another opportunity id like to touch on is in glaucoma with the launch of combination eye drops with several benefits over current treatments these include being preservativefree to reduce stinging and burning sensations as well as increasing corneal penetration and length of residence on the eye by offering a lower cost solution with increased convenience for patients imprimis cfo andrew boll has commented that twothirds of the companys  existing ophthalmology customers prescribe glaucoma medication if half of existing customers give the company their glaucoma business at  per month and  customers per physician it equates to a  million revenue opportunity per month for a company with a market capitalization of around  million and close to  million in revenue in  that is a big opportunity dont forget that management expects significant margin expansion in  due to production efficiency after having made its over  million investment in robotics and automation in a new start of the art cgmp facility such a facility should result in the company acquiring new client accounts hidden opportunity in b management has previously commented on pursuing a new drug application nda for their product reformulations via the b pathway though not part of the core business model and the company does not have the resources to pursue these opportunities alone they have developed several unique drug formulations that are either patented or patent pending ceo mark baum has already stated they have entered into confidential discussions with pharmaceutical executives and other experts to monetise these assets the biggest of these opportunites might be in the companys patent pending formulation of mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals acthar gel which sells for around  today accounting for  of the  billion dollar firms revenue in its most recent quarter imprimis candidate has been in a stability study for over six months expenses for the program have been minimal and if the asset is monetised in the medium term the resulting cash would be much welcome to aid the companys expansion in ophthalmology as to what a deal would look like mark baum had the following to say which i believe every investor should read twice its not going to cost our shareholders much but i think it is going to potentially drive considerable value as an asset on our balance sheet whether its an out license program or an asset that we sell or shares in the company in a spinoff that we own but it could be of considerable value monetisation of other such assets is a possibility this year as well actions to take and risks for investors interested in this story who have done their due diligence i suggest buying an initial position in the near term also in the near to medium term in the event of significant volatility or share price weakness i would add to this position investors can win in multiple ways as ophthalmology revenues continue to grow with several product launches throughout the year also in the event of monetizing the companys product reformulations the balance sheet could stand to benefit considerably and future dilution prove unnecessary or reduced risks to the story include execution risk in product launches significant competition with larger much better capitalized companies fighting to retain market share and delayed profitability due to focus on growth baum has stated achieving profitability in the near term is an area of focus with most of capital expenditures behind the company personally i infer from the conference call that it could happen by year end  or in the first half of  cost structure is currently being refined with cashbased expenditures to decrease by  million annually on march nd the company raised  million in a direct offering i was encouraged to see that several company officials including baum participated in the offering i wouldnt be surprised to see another one later in the year albeit hopefully at a higher share price lastly ceo compensation for baum appears incredibly excessive to me authors note my goal is to identify undervalued stocks for my readers with favorable riskreward profiles and catalysts that could propel shares higher i categorize ideas into nearterm mediumterm months to a year and long term multiyear based on when i expect outperformance to potentially occur if that interests you consider clicking the follow button at the top of the
