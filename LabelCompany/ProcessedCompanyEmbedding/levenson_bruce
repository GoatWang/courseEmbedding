mo ivory the email wasnt shocking and teams problems have nothing to do with race she says the failure to put a winning team on the court is the real problem ivory levenson could reap a financial reward in this sale editors note mo ivory is an attorney and radio personality who lives in atlanta and washington dc follow her on twitter moivory the opinions expressed in this commentary are hers cnn  atlanta hawks majority owner bruce levenson just figured out how to get rid of a product that no one wants to purchase by throwing himself on the confessional table of bigotry  which will probably make him more wealthy than he could have ever imagined sure the publicity isnt flattering and levensons hand may have been forced by the hawks internal investigation but this is not about racism this is about business what we know ive lived in atlanta for close to  years  the hawks games are boring i cant name the players i dont know who they are married to or what they do in the community they are not a fabric of my interest i wish they had a star player whose jersey i wanted to buy so i could finally hang my dominique wilkins jersey up as memorabilia this is not about racism this is about business so like all other nonatlanta natives living in atlanta long term when the hawks play the new york knicks this native new yorker whips out her carmelo anthony jersey and heads to phillips arena the reason bruce levenson could not make the hawks profitable is not because black people dont buy season tickets or arrive at games late or spend all their time at the bar or black fathers dont bring black sons to the games its because the hawks suck they have no marquee players and they dont win games yes theyve made the playoffs in the past seven years but havent gotten as far as the conference finals mo ivory this is not about racism this is about business the few years that the hawks have made it to the playoffs you can hardly make it down centennial olympic drive in time for tipoff because the traffic is so thick fans white and black show up when their hometown team is winning period this is not about racism this is about business opinion atlanta hawks owner is a hypocrite are there unique factors to every city that accounts for distinctions between fan bases sure new orleans memphis new york and boston fans show up  even when their teams are not having a winning season those cities are not as transient as atlanta thats something bruce levenson fails to realize is unique to atlanta this is not about racism this is about business bruce levensons  email in which he shared his ideas about why his franchise was not as profitable as he hoped as unscientific as it was can hardly be called shocking or rise to the level of racially polarizing it was another wealthy white man sharing his commonly thought views on the spending habits or lack thereof of black consumers and how that affects white consumers who white business executives consider the most valued consumer in america this is not about racism this is about business i was slightly annoyed with nba commissioner adam silver commending mr levenson for coming forward and selfreporting levenson revealed his email of august  to silver in july  after the hawks found it in an internal investigation and precisely the time that investigators for donald sterling were looking to expose other nba owners for any possible racial missteps its no coincidence that an nba investigation on this levenson matter was kept secret and remained pending until the sterling deal became final why are we just now hearing about it silver knew yet he didnt reveal it to the public racism has never been as profitable in the nba as it is right now in the wake of the historic  billion sale of the clippers the almost doubling of national television deals that are sure to bring record profits to the league and the identification of interested purchasers lined up and ready to close the deals

problems have nothing to do with race she says the failure to put a winning team on the court is the real problem ivory levenson could reap a financial reward in this sale editors note mo ivory is an attorney and radio personality who lives in atlanta and washington dc follow her on twitter moivory the opinions expressed in this commentary are hers cnn  atlanta hawks majority owner bruce levenson just figured out how to get rid of a product that no one wants to purchase by throwing himself on the confessional table of bigotry  which will probably make him more wealthy than he could have ever imagined sure the publicity isnt flattering and levensons hand may have been forced by the hawks internal investigation but this is not about racism this is about business what we know ive lived in atlanta for close to  years  the hawks games are boring i cant name the players i dont know who they are married to or what they do in the community they are not a fabric of my interest i wish they had a star player whose jersey i wanted to buy so i could finally hang my dominique wilkins jersey up as memorabilia this is not about racism this is about business so like all other nonatlanta natives living in atlanta long term when the hawks play the new york knicks this native new yorker whips out her carmelo anthony jersey and heads to phillips arena the reason bruce levenson could not make the hawks profitable is not because black people dont buy season tickets or arrive at games late or spend all their time at the bar or black fathers dont bring black sons to the games its because the hawks suck they have no marquee players and they dont win games yes theyve made the playoffs in the past seven years but havent gotten as far as the conference finals mo ivory this is not about racism this is about business the few years that the hawks have made it to the playoffs you can hardly make it down centennial olympic drive in time for tipoff because the traffic is so thick fans white and black show up when their hometown team is winning period this is not about racism this is about business opinion atlanta hawks owner is a hypocrite are there unique factors to every city that accounts for distinctions between fan bases sure new orleans memphis new york and boston fans show up  even when their teams are not having a winning season those cities are not as transient as atlanta thats something bruce levenson fails to realize is unique to atlanta this is not about racism this is about business bruce levensons  email in which he shared his ideas about why his franchise was not as profitable as he hoped as unscientific as it was can hardly be called shocking or rise to the level of racially polarizing it was another wealthy white man sharing his commonly thought views on the spending habits or lack thereof of black consumers and how that affects white consumers who white business executives consider the most valued consumer in america this is not about racism this is about business i was slightly annoyed with nba commissioner adam silver commending mr levenson for coming forward and selfreporting levenson revealed his email of august  to silver in july  after the hawks found it in an internal investigation and precisely the time that investigators for donald sterling were looking to expose other nba owners for any possible racial missteps its no coincidence that an nba investigation on this levenson matter was kept secret and remained pending until the sterling deal became final why are we just now hearing about it silver knew yet he didnt reveal it to the public racism has never been as profitable in the nba as it is right now in the wake of the historic  billion sale of the clippers the almost doubling of national television deals that are sure to bring record profits to the league and the identification of interested purchasers lined up and ready to close the deals bruce levenson is a businessman following the business model

racist email was racistyes bruce levensons racist email was racistalbert burneko0 0pmfiled to bruce levensonatlanta hawksnbadonald sterlingracismcapitalismcapital it fails us noweditpromoteshare to kinjatoggle conversation toolsgo to permalink by now youre aware that bruce levenson controlling owner of the atlanta hawks is selling his stake in the team at least in part because of fallout from an email he sent to other members of team management back in  theorizing that the team struggles to fill its arena because the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a signficant season ticket base in the email levenson attributes this to an inarena experience overwhelmingly oriented toward black fans hiphop music playing over the pa system black cheerleaders a too black kisscam hiphop and gospel concerts after the games ticket giveaways that in levensons description went primarily to black atlantans he looks out at the stands and guesses that our crowd is 0 percent black now still four to five times all other teams and my further guess is that 0 still feels like 0 to some whites at our games  i think it is far and way the number one reason our season ticket base is so lowadvertisement a lot of people like jason whitlock—theoretical proprietor of a nonexistent black grantland—think this isnt racist their argument is that rather than animosity toward blacks levensons email expresses a realists recognition of white racism combined with the mundane rational desire of a business owner to broaden the demographic appeal of his product in the offending email levenson does his best to provide some cover for this interpretation in the following passage please dont get me wrong there was nothing threatening going on in the arean back then i never felt uncomfortable but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority on fan sites i would read comments about how dangerous it is around philips yet in our  years i dont know of a mugging or even a pick pocket incident this was just racist garbage when i hear some people saying the arena is in the wrong place i think it is code for there are too many blacks at the games one way to read this is as proof that levenson is not racist but rather aware of and disgusted by racism hes calling out racists as many observers have described itadvertisementadvertisement the problem with this line of interpretation—one of the problems anyway—is that this is all basically the im not a racist in an im not a racist but riff levensons proposed response to all this damnable bigotry after all is to make the inarena experience friendlier to racists no really thats the very next part of his email i have been open with our executive team about these concerns i have told them i want some white cheerleaders and while i dont care what the color of the artist is i want the music to be music familiar to a 0 year old white guy if thats our season tixs demo i have also balked when every fan picked out of crowd to shoot shots in some time out contest is black i have even bitched that the kiss cam is too black i am sick of seeing all these black people kissing each other will probably not strike you as a particularly bold stance against racism dispense right away with the notion that this merely is a business owner seeking to broaden the heretoforenarrow demographic appeal of his product in  the average hawks game drew  fans to the arena philips arena has a capacity of  for basketball recall levensons estimate of a 0 percent black crowd at games even if diversifying the cheerleading squad and rockin some sweet kenny chesney tuneage on the pa filled all the remaining  seats with white people thatd lower black attendance only to around  percent nowhere near the magical  percent number he seems to think is the key to unlocking season ticket sales to get to that number hed actively have to drive away around  paying black customers at which point per his theorizing he could fill the arena with grateful whites perhaps thats an ungenerous interpretation of levensons intent but consider that by nate silvers estimate the hawks overall fan base is  percent black if levensons roughly correct in his eyeball guess that 0 percent of game attendees are black then black fans are roughly proportionately represented at hawks games taking into account that black households have disproportionately low incomes or perhaps even slightly underrepresented no matter how you look at it levenson isnt just talking about cold demographics and he certainly isnt talking about how his teams unique ability to draw black fans is an actual strength hes talking about stiffarming black fans to make more room for white onesadvertisement maybe this dude who managed to make enough money to buy a controlling interest in an nba team is just bad at math though maybe hes just saying white people are wealthier than black people so more white fans  more season ticket sales and hey thats probably just cold unfortunate but observable truth right bruce levenson didnt personally create systemic injustice hes just a realist with an arena to filladvertisement this line of reasoning is though an insidious artifact of our time the notion that because someone—bruce levenson say—is a mere inheritor of american societys racial stratification this inoculates him against charges of racism when he figures out how to navigate that stratification profitably the notion that capitulation to the reality of racism—an actual reallife proposal to engineer an nba product that presents as more friendly to white bigots—is mere economic rationality as valueneutral as figuring out the most gasefficient route to a destination hey take it up with george washington buddy im just doin what i gotta do leave aside for a moment anyway the fact that even a dimwitted yearold knows better than to whip out this sort of hey he started it bullshit leave aside also the reality that as a billionaire bruce levenson could live in uninterrupted comfort and outrageous luxury for the rest of several lifetimes even if he decided hed rather make no more money at all than profit off of calculated exploitation of racism this is the logic behind redlining behind the nbas dress code behind roger goodells selffetishization as the hammer of sports justice black people and black culture are repulsive to whites whites are more valuable than blacks because black money chases off white money therefore black people and black culture must be contained so as not to impede our access to whites this is the logic of systemic racism distinct from but no better than personal distaste for black people this is a seemingly reasonable person endorsing the idea that a dollar from a black person is literally worth less than a dollar from a white one because the dollar from a black person carries an invisible tax it drives away white people while a dollar from a white person draws in more of them in the hands of a business owner—translated into suggested changes to that businesss product into his complaints to his underlings about say the number of black cheerleaders that business employs—it ceases to be an idea it is the enforcement of disparity the literal devaluing of black dollars your actual ticket purchase is worth less to us than the hypothetical ticket sales we might get from racists by driving you awayadvertisement when a sports team owner says he wants some more white cheerleaders so the team can make some more money do you think hes saying double the number of cheerleaders on our payroll for the sake of diversity or replace some of these black cheerleaders with white ones when he says that do you think it matters all that much whether its because he actively hates blacks or because hes cynically banking on other rich white peoples hatred of blacks do you think the replaced black cheerleaders will buy an argument that race isnt the reason the white team owner fired themadvertisement this is white flightasmarketing different only by degree from the atlanta braves taking their business to suburban cobb county in pursuit of white dollars it may be a shrewd market calculation it is also definitionally racist it poses the business offered by black people against the preferences of white bigots and prioritizes the latter that capitalism will reward this choice by paying out for the business owner who makes it is not a defense of the choice it is an indictment of capitalism the fact that in this particular case we are talking about attempts to render the product of a majorityblack workforce more appealing to white bigots so that the white management class will have more profits to skim for itself only casts the whole thing in starker relief bruce levenson is racist so are his buddies so is the system that enriches them photo via
