series posted on february   get in the know with our q  newsletter posted on february   keeping calm amidst volatility posted on november   our investment approach is a bottomup fundamental research method that emphasizes the importance of individual stocks and companies as opposed to a topdown approach that focuses on larger hard to predict themes such as the economy politics and market moving events we believe this approach allows us to withstand shortterm fluctuations by avoiding the noise of shortterm volatility inducing events rather than begin with a theory about the direction of the economy then develop expectations about which sectors will rise or fall then choose a company within that sector a process that layers broad assumption on top of broad assumption we search out good companies across a wide swath of sectors and industries from there we conduct due diligence on management teams and financial statements comparing and assessing these companies based on very specific criteria our opinion of the economy and the stock market is then derived from our collective view of the companies we own and follow for our clients to be clear we are constant students of what is happening on the domestic and world economic and political stages but our analysis of these events plays a supplementary role take the election for instance we can’t claim to know what the future holds but there is always the potential for shortterm volatility following an election like any other major event we will watch eagerly but will make our investment decisions for the longterm in fact history suggests the shortterm volatility following any election is a poor predictor of future stock market returns especially for the subsequent month period according to bloomberg the sp  index fluctuates an average of  the day after an election while this is no small amount for a one day market move gains and losses predict the market’s direction for the next  months less than  of the time a few months down the road we will likely add this presidential election to the list of recent overhyped events which includes the russianukrainian conflict the greek debt crisis the chinese gdp slowdown and brexit following the election stay tuned for the next big media sensation the fed’s december decision on interest rates social security cost of living adjustment posted on november   the social security administration announced that the  cost of living adjustment cola for social security will be  while this is nothing earth shattering something is better than last year’s nothing regarding medicare part b payments according to an article written by mary beth frankel of investment news “by law the majority of beneficiaries are protected by a “hold harmless” rule that says their social security benefits cannot decrease from one year to the next due to an increase in medicare part b premiums in other words the increase in their monthly medicare part b premiums which pays for doctors’ visits and outpatient services cannot exceed the dollar amount increase in their social security benefits” also social security taxes will be paid on wages up to  for  up from  for  and  as always there remains no wage limit for medicare taxes withholding if you have any questions regarding either social security or medicare please do not hesitate to contact us information regarding your required minimum distribution rmd posted on october   those clients with an ira nonroth simple ira sep ira or retirement plan account must generally take a withdrawal upon reaching age ½ the amount you must withdraw is called the required minimum distribution rmd beginning in january we reach out to our clients that will have an rmd within the year to help them through the process of taking their rmd the amount you are required to take for the current tax year is listed on the last page of your monthly account statement under the “distribution summary” section you will be able to view your required gross amount any federal and state tax that was withheld and the net amount of the distribution to help you with your cash flow planning this amount will be updated throughout the year depending on how and when you take your rmd your distribution may be taken in a lump sum payment monthly or quarterly installments if you have questions regarding your rmd or if you aren’t sure if you have taken your rmd this year please give us a call and we will be happy to help you   structured certificates of deposit cds posted on september   as your investment advisor we are held to a fiduciary standard  skipping the legalese and court cases which specifically define fiduciary this means we act in your best interest in providing our investment advice  this sounds obvious but many firmsbrokersinsurance agents aren’t held to this tough standard  they can and will sell you anything deemed suitable for you  so a lot of what we do with you is to get to know you your financial situation goals and tolerance for risk when coming up with a financial plan and implementing that plan for you  these are the proactive steps we take the duty of care in managing your investments  and this is an ongoing relationship as your financial situations changes throughout the years  there is another aspect to how we manage money for you that you don’t see—and for good reason  these are the investments you won’t see in your portfolio  these investments might be entire asset classes certain stocks bonds or funds or insurance products  why banks brokers and insurance companies have invented all manner of suitable products which are either very expensive to you or seem too good to be true eg upside to the stock market with no downside or have hidden fees  we hear these sales pitches often on your behalf  so we wanted to take this short blog post to highlight one of those products that was recently the subject of a page one article in the wall street journal the structured certificate of deposit cd httpwwwwsjcomarticleswallstreetreengineersthecdandreturnssuffer we will provide just a short summary here but the article is worth the time to read  with the bull market in stocks and lack of meaningful interest yields on low risk investments wall street banks ie goldman jp morgan merrill lynch barclays etc have created structured certificates of deposit cds to entice savers  these are cds linked to stocks or some other commodity combining some limited upside and some limited downside with guaranteed hefty fees for the salesperson and product creators the cds have very little liquidity if you need to sell before maturity too  the journal’s analysis of  marketlinked cds issued at least three years ago by barclays showed only a small number exceeding the returns an investor would have earned on a conventional fdicinsured risk free cd  if the product being sold to you has a long fancy name like “gs momentum builder multiasset  er indexlinked certificate of deposit due ” a real structured cd and disclosure documents which run hundreds of pages most do alarm bells should be ringing in your head  you won’t see nwic buying these in your portfolio nwic
