thank you very much nelli good morning everyone and thank you for joining us we are pleased to report our results for the first quarter ended march   core ffo for the quarter was  per diluted share in both  and  normalized ffo for the first quarter of  was also  per diluted share representing an increase of  yearoveryear community noi increased  yearoveryear sameproperty noi increased  yearoveryear driven by a sameproperty occupancy gain of  basis points umh had a busy quarter on the acquisition front during the quarter we completed the acquisition of five communities containing approximately  developed homesites situated on  acres for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  million the weighted average occupancy of these communities was  we have a proven history of improving communities that we acquire by making the necessary investments to bring them up to a high standard umh further recognizes that vacant sites have significant value when the economies surrounding those vacancies improve our portfolio is now comprised of  communities with  developed homesites located throughout seven states we are very proud of our high quality portfolio and were recently honored with the manufactured housing expertise landlease community of the year award for the northeast midatlantic region this award was for port royal village of  sites allage community situated on approximately  acres this award showcases our dedication to providing quality affordable housing at all of our locations we will continue to focus on acquiring communities with significant upside potential and leverage our expertise to build longterm value for shareholders this task is becoming increasingly difficult given the attractiveness of the asset class manufactured housing delivers a high quality income stream that many firms and investors are seeking and therefore demand for our property type is very strong that being said we expect to be able to acquire select communities on a oneoff basis to continue our growth strategy the increased demand for property type has resulted in continued cap rate compression this validates the substantial value that umh has created by acquiring  communities containing approximately  homesites over the past six years umh also anticipates a number of expansions to our existing community in particular we are proud to announce the opening of our first allrental community memphis blues and memphis tennessee this community will results in phases and will ultimately contain over  homesites we continue to execute on our longterm business plan and are very happy with the consistent improvement in our operating metrics umh is on track to growth over  million in rental and related income this year weve added significant value to our existing portfolio by upgrading our communities thereby increasing occupancy and revenue our metrics across the board continued to improve during the first quarter community net operating income increased by  and our operating expense ratio has continued to improve yearoveryear from  to  representing a  basis points improvement as occupancy continues to increase the ratio should improve further our sameproperty results have also strengthened substantially increasing the value of our communities sameproperty occupancy increased from  to  yearoveryear representing a gain of a  basis points yearoveryear same property revenue increased  while expenses only increased  resulting in an increase in sameproperty noi of  our strong sameproperty operating results continue to validate our business plans of acquiring communities in strong geographic locations below replacement costs making necessary improvements and growing occupancy and revenue by utilizing our rental home and sales program our rental home program continues to be the primary driver of our occupancy and revenue growth the demand for our rental home is strong and predominantly all the markets that we operate in our product is extremely high in quality and our communities provide amenities and services that other forms of housing cannot at this price point during the first quarter we installed and rented approximately  homes including those purchased with our community acquisition at quarter end our rental home portfolio consisted of approximately  homes representing  of our total homesites occupancy of our rental homes continues to be strong and was  at quarter end we plan to install and rent approximately  new homes per year as demand dictate our sales of manufactured homes have not yet returned to prerecession level although this quarter we increased home sales by approximately  from  million in gross sales in  to  million in  this filing was still not enough for sales operations to be profitable we are encouraged to see that overall industry shipments in february  increased  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of almost  home housing demand and alternative housing costs favor our industry conventional home prices were at prerecession levels and continued to increase the spcaseshiller us national home price index recorded a  annual gain in february sales of existing homes in march at the highest level in a decade the supply of homes on the market is low the unemployment rate is at a year low as higher increases in wages rise lower unemployment wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation which increases the need for affordable workforce housing we are optimistic that we will achieve continued growth in  and now anna will provide you with greater detail on the results for the first quarter anna chew thank you sam core funds from operations or core ffo was  million or  per diluted share for the first quarter of  compared to  million or  per diluted share for the prior year period normalized ffo which excludes realized gains on the sale of securities and other nonrecurring items was  million or  per diluted share for the first quarter of  compared to  million or  per diluted share for the prior year period representing an increase of  on a per share basis rental and related income for the quarter was  million compared to  million a year ago representing an increase of  primarily due to community acquisitions the addition of rental homes and the growth in occupancy community noi increased by  for the quarter from  million in  to  million in  this is the th consecutive quarter that we have delivered doubledigit yearoveryear noi growth community operating expenses for the quarter were  of rental and related income representing a  basis point improvement over the  expense ratio for the prior year period as we noted in the past most of the community expenses consist of fixed costs and therefore as occupancy rates continue to increase and as we upgrade and integrate our acquisitions these expense ratios will continue to improve as we turn to our capital structure at quarter end we had approximately  million in debt of which  million was community level fixed rate mortgage debt at a weighted average interest rate of  and  million were loans payable at a weighted average interest rate of   of our total debt is fixed rate the weighted average interest rate on our total debt is  compared to  in the prior year period during the quarter we renewed and expanded our unsecured revolving credit facility this increased the borrowing capacity from  million to  million with a  million accordion feature bringing the total potential of availability up to  million we have reached a milestone this quarter increasing our total enterprise value to over  billion representing a  increase yearoveryear in addition to our  million in debt at quarter end we had a total of  million in perpetual preferred equity and an equity market capitalization of  million from a credit standpoint our net debt to total market capitalization was  our net debt less securities to total market capitalization was  our fixed charge coverage was  times our net debt to ebitda was  times and net debt less securities to ebitda was  times from a liquidity standpoint we ended the quarter with  million in cash and cash equivalents  million in our securities portfolio encumbered by  million in margin loans and  million available on our credit facility we also had  million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory and now let me turn it over to gene before we open it up for questions eugene landy thank you anna umh is celebrating its th year of operations as founder and chairman of the board of directors im pleased with the substantial progress umh has made in its longterm strategic business plan as sam mentioned over the past six years we have more than doubled the size of our portfolio by acquiring  communities containing approximately  homesites we have increased occupancy and revenue with these communities thereby generating significant increased value to our shareholders umhs first quarter results were an excellent start to  we have delivered solid performance metrics with doubledigit growth in rental revenue home sales total noi and sameproperty noi the performance of our securities portfolio has been excellent we are very pleased with our current holdings which had a  million in net unrealized gains at quarter end the future prospects for umh properties are excellent we continue to focus on our business plan and have positioned ourselves for strong growth in  and beyond we will now be happy to take questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from craig kucera of wunderlich please go ahead craig kucera with the acquisitions you completed this quarter they were all in kind of midtolate january what was the impact to operating expenses quarter if any and how should we think about what the budget is to may be clean those up this year and next year if you can provide that anna chew i think in the beginning we had additional  some additional expenses but i believe that before the end of the year we will bring it back down to our normal operating expense ratio of about   craig kucera got it so we should see a bump i guess in the next quarter or so bringing down  anna chew yes craig kucera then coming back okay this is a big quarter for acquisitions for you and i appreciate the commentary on the market and may be doing more oneoffs but how should we think about the rest of the year do we think that first quarter was probably the bulk of acquisition volume for this year brett taft yes this is brett taft here vice president of acquisitions and we have only one property in our pipeline right now for about  million we are working on a couple other oneoff deals nothing id like to comment on too much further right now but i would expect some continued growth throughout the year craig kucera got it with the administration change and turnover in congress are you hearing or seeing any movement in regard to loosening lending as regards to manufactured home sales eugene landy we just returned from the mhi conference in las vegas and there was very very upbeat were making substantial progress on all the legislative fronts we are making very good progress with fha with freddie mac we are very optimistic its going to take a little more time but we think our ability to get the government sponsored entities to provide mortgages on our products and hopefully channel mortgages on homes for both of us and our tenants so we think the legislative front were going to make substantial progress and we really should i mean the regulatory environment used to be very restrictive and were hopeful that we can expand our lending and expand our ability to finance new communities craig kucera okay one more for me i will jump back in the queue with the expansion of the line are you likely to utilize that more heavily and keep a higher balance on that or you more inclined to continue to predominantly finance yourself with mortgages anna chew well we do a little bit of both because right now the interest rates are really  the protected low interest rates are great for us while mortgages and we can get year financing at a fixed rate of around i would say between  to  so well do a little bit of both some of the communities that we purchase do not qualify for freddie mac or fannie mae financing because again were buying  or  occupied communities those we can put in the line and utilize the line operator the next question comes from brian hollenden of sidoti please go ahead brian hollenden good morning guys and thanks for taking my call samuel landy thank you brian hollenden can you talk a little bit about i noticed yearoveryear the proceeds from the trip program kind of was about  million higher just may be talk about a little bit why the big change eugene landy well i really like the trip and sip and weve been really pushing very hard to get on the msci index and the rmc index which we balances i think monday so we will find out monday if all our efforts are successful the higher capitalization you have the more likely youre going to get on the index and weve increased the outstanding shares to  million shares and at the current market price were very close to  million market capitalization and isnt this always but one of the reasons weve been interested in raising capitalization rather than borrowing money or issuing more preferred is because of the way the index works and were one of the few reits that is not on the index and were going to find out if we go on the index with the milestone for the company but we have no control over that thats done by the people who run the index brian hollenden appreciate that color turning now may be to the sale of manufactured homes seasonally the first quarter and the fourth quarter are weaker due to weather but what are you kind of seeing as we move into the spring and whats going on on that front can you talk a little bit about the sales effort and may be what we should expect over the next six months samuel landy well i believe were seeing improvement in sales we have the sale centers at port royal village heather highlands sunnyside and when theres no sales its very hard to properly staff those or get them going but as sales improve success generates success so things are getting better and i think we could do far better and i think  may be a turning point on sales but its still just the start of what we can really do eugene landy in a way home competition the rental program is so successful it is so well received  to  a month we provide a three bedroom home with two bath which is very competitive in the area and its really a good deal for the consumer and at those costs we compete with ourselves on semihomes particularly unless we can get lower cost financing competitively people are renting but were very happy that rentals are doing so well and if i make one more observation which i make every time the overall housing situation in the united states is that theres a shortage of housing and theres a really serious shortage of affordable housing and were in markets that are growing and population growing and workforce so our prospect is not quartertoquarter but yeartoyear is very good in our opinion brian hollenden thanks and im sorry if i missed this earlier but did you sort of update expectations on how many rentals you do plan on adding in  is  to  about the right number samuel landy thats right thats the right range we acquired some rentals in acquisitions and we  demand certainly has allowed us last year and most likely this year to add  on our own so somewhere between  and  is most likely brian hollenden okay and any maybe just last for me and i will get back into queue any major changes in the marcellus region in terms of demands samuel landy well yes the minute after the election we got calls from the drilling companies et cetera that they were hiring again and that they needed houses and im talking about it was two days after the election and also were going to close on our first gas lease in a number of years where we sold the drilling rights for  and  royalties and that should close this month i believe yes eugene landy were still as bullish as we go by at every presentation on what the marcellus and utica shale will do so the areas in which is located which includes the main areas in which we have communities operator the next question comes from paula poskon of stov advisory services please go ahead paula poskon i just have one followup on your commentary about your allrental community in memphis that youre working on are you optimistic that an allrental community will make it easier to get financing through the gscs and more broadly what is your appetite for having more allrental communities in the portfolio samuel landy well we think its a great model and we love to do it again and again an apartment builder builds a  square foot three bedroom two bath units for  we could build it for about  and that makes us extremely cost competitive for the people who want housing plus theres no commonwall neighbor above you below you or under you so as a rental product the acceptance is incredible which is why were renting out  or  homes per year were really looking forward to completing the occupancy of memphis blues theres currently homes rented there the grand opening is actually not going to be until next month but even before the grand opening weve rented houses and its going very well and yes we look forward to doing more and anna will tell you about the financing anna chew well what weâve done is we have a roundtable discussion with the gscs as matter of fact with fannie mae and then we had a meeting with freddie mac and they were very receptive to this program they dont know if they can do it yet but they are thinking about it when we have an allrental community because as weve pointed out its very similar to a garden apartment they have questions regarding of course the maintenance of it but i said itâs just like any other maintenance of a garden apartment what is the difference so they were very receptive to it theyre thinking about it we cant do anything of course until it is more built up and more occupied but they have it in their radar screen paula poskon thank you and just one last question on that do you expect there will be any difference in the expense ratio in managing an allrental property versus an ownership rental mix community samuel landy interestingly right now new revenue was coming in at a  expense ratio which is lower than the current overall umh expense ratio so you have to factor in these are brand new rental units but i dont see any reason that its good the expense ratio is going to exceed our norms which are  if we are paying the water and sewer and  if its direct billed to the resident so it seems like all is going very well on the expenses in managing the rental units and at this moment i see no reason to believe thats going to change anna chew of course its the beginning because we are in the beginning phases of memphis blues there are some i will call them fixed costs which we will have to go over as we build the community operator the next question comes from michael boulgaris of boulgaris investments please go ahead michael boulgaris thank you good morning and thank you for taking my question sam could you give us an update as to the progress in saratoga samuel landy yes weve completed approximately   lots were ready to go there is homes setup they are absolutely gorgeous the timing is perfect because saratoga is a very seasonal area and were really looking forward to kicking this off we already have interest in a couple of homes of sale and were very excited about it and its ready to go michael boulgaris and mentioned you comment on just traffic overall by region that youre seeing earlier this year samuel landy yes we have a traffic report that tells us how were doing on traffic and it is higher than ever for the season i mean quarter two was usually your highest traffic of the year but quarter one  well dramatically exceeds  homes was the traffic in quarter one  a little over  was the traffic first quarter  michael boulgaris okay and im going to miss it but i believe sameproperty occupancy was  at yearend  could you refresh me what the sameproperty occupancy was at the end of q anna chew at the end of q sameproperty occupancy now dont forget its a different sameproperty pool because we update it every year sameproperty pool for  are properties that were owned as of  see january   and sameproperty occupancy for the  numbers were properties owned as of january   so you have to take that into account but the sameproperty occupancy as of march   on this new pool is  compared to a year ago this pool was  michael boulgaris very well and anna with the i guess the number of acquisitions in q was above the operating expense a bit frontloaded this year or maybe you could just  if you could give us some guidance as to where thats going to level out some in terms of the rate of growth anna chew absolutely we always have a little more expenses when we first acquired the community well some cleanup et cetera but we believe that these communities will generate approximately the same expense ratio as our other communities brett taft and just to add a little more color there two properties we purchased in indiana were very high quality we shouldnt expect too many increased expenses on that front one of the properties acquired in ohio and one of the properties in pennsylvania will require a little bit more of an increase in initial expenses but the way weve structured our acquisition program we intend to take care of them within the first six months in ownership now the other property in ohio should not dramatically increase expenses so samuel landy and brett tell him about how optimistic we are on hillcrest and whats going on there brett taft we purchased hillcrest crossing in lower burrell pennsylvania it was a  it is a  site community it was purchased  occupied the old owner just did not have the resources they needed to make it move forward we demoed about  to  units in the community already it looks fantastic we have  homes on order all of which are spoken for so we expect to infill that community very quickly at some meaningful value michael boulgaris are you saying is that petrochemical complex starting to be more impactful in terms of your western pa occupancy samuel landy yes this is the pittsburgh area thats where hillcrest is and we know just what happened nobody in the area did well for  years and theyre basically giving up and were coming in and we see the turnaround occurring every day and we are workforce housing were  dependent on the job market for blue collar workers but the job market is improving dramatically and we get to ride that wave anna chew and were also putting in brand new homes that people have not seen in the recent past samuel landy let me cover the shell cracker plant i believe its between  billion and  billion and will require  people to build it over three years but its  they have not yet started construction but thats a pretty arbitrary line because preconstruction work was pretty substantial moving six lane highways and putting in utilities and that sort of thing but the shell is going ahead with this cracker plant and my understanding of the oil and gas industry is everyone expects two or three more plants of the same size in the same areas as they develop experience with it so itâs going to be a very very positive job and employment and economic growth of that area which is going to be fantastic there i always tell you pittsburgh is going to be like qatar and the middle east  years from now brett taft and mike the thing we should tell everybody google panda plants panda plants take natural gas out of the ground and convert it to electricity its the most efficient form of electric generating ever created they are opening these billion dollar plants all over pennsylvania and its going to be fantastic for pennsylvania and fantastic for us michael boulgaris and lastly if i could ask the chairman gene i guess in philadelphia last fall you spoke i think got rather optimistically regarding the dividends you continue to have that optimism looking ahead and may be also if you could give us some perspective looking in terms of the intrinsic value or speaking to the total return of umh what you see in the future as you witnessed umh in tough times and now as things are starting to look better eugene landy well its a cycle what were doing is building value into the parks and the parks are going ahead nicely and as we increase the occupancy and increase the rent the ability to mortgage these parks increases we think it takes several years to get to the point we can go back to freddie mac and i believe we borrow what is   anna chew  to  eugene landy  to  of value and at that point when we can take a product that we bought and have turned around and go back and get the investment we made out of it in fact get additional cash theres a substantial amount of money that we can refinance and were talking  million  million  million an additional financing over the next two three years based on the increased income from these parks and as those numbers are realized and it just takes time to show freddie macs that were getting these results and going pipe for the mortgages and get them and then that cash really changes right now we put in  million in rental home so we finance it largely out of our own equity and we will get all that equity back plus and im very optimistic that we will be able to increase the dividend substantially over the years as we increase occupancy with  sites with almost  vacancies and as we fill these vacancies our financial strength will be substantial so we will take a good look at the dividend as these numbers continue to improve operator and this concludes our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to samuel landy for any closing remarks samuel landy thank you operator i would like to thank the participants on this call for their continued support and interest in our company as always gene anna and i are

you for joining us we are pleased to report our results for the fourth quarter and year ended december   umh was one of the top performing reits in  with a total shareholder return of  it was an excellent year for umh highlighted by our normalized ffo per share growth of  this marks our fourth consecutive year of doubledigit earnings per share growth for the fourth quarter our normalized ffo was  per diluted share fully covering our  per share quarterly dividend umh is continued to opportunistically acquire valueadd communities in  we purchased a total of three communities containing approximately  developed homesites situated on  acres for an aggregate cost of approximately  million subsequent to yearend we completed the acquisition of an additional five communities containing approximately  developed homesites situated on  acres for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  million our portfolio is now comprised of  communities with  developed homesites located throughout seven states we will continue to focus on acquiring communities with significant upside potential and leverage our expertise to build longterm value for shareholders our product is workforce housing the return of manufacturing jobs to the areas where we operate as well as increased our occupancy in income our results are directly tied to the fortunes of the economies in these areas our communities in the energy rich marcellus and utica shale regions are poised for additional growth given the new administrations prodomestic energy initiatives additionally technological advances have reduced the cost of drilling oil and gas companies in the marcellus and utica shale regions are again profitable we are seeing interest for new oil and gas leases new drilling will spur the continued growth in the local economies lower energy prices reduce the cost of manufacturing in the northeast and we directly benefit as new jobs are created in our regions umh recognized that vacant lots have significant value when the economy surrounding those vacancies improves our  square foot three bedroom two bath homes are readily accepted as workforce housing at returns that have made umh one of the best performing reits in  our  vacant sites provide us with opportunity to continue to rapidly improve our results for the next several years i will now focus on our performance for the fullyear and then anna will drill down further on our fourth quarter results our metrics across the board continue to improve in  community net operating income increased by  and our operating expense ratio has continued to improve from  in  to  in  our sameproperty results have also strengthened substantially increasing the value of our communities sameproperty occupancy increased from  at yearend  to  at yearend  representing a gain of  basis points yearoveryear sameproperty revenue increased  while expenses only increased  resulting in an increase in the sameproperty noi of  our strong sameproperty operating results continue to validate our business plan of acquiring communities in strong geographic locations below replacement costs making necessary improvements and growing occupancy and revenue by utilizing our rental home and sales programs our rental home program continues to be the primary driver of our occupancy and revenue growth it is the most efficient way to increase our occupancy thereby increasing the value of our communities which can then be realized through refinancing during  we installed and rented approximately  homes at yearend our rental home portfolio consisted of approximately  homes representing  of our total homesites the demand for our rental homes continues to be strong demonstrated by a rental home occupancy of  this demand is driven by the need for affordable workforce housing in our geographic areas in  national home prices increased  upward pressure on existing home price is due to tight supply rising mortgage rates and stringent mortgage requirements have steered housing demand to renting these factors will propel demand to our sector since we can provide quality housing at the lowest cost in any given market our sales of manufactured homes have not yet returned to prerecession levels although this year we increased home sales by approximately  from  million in gross sales in  to  million in  this volume is still not enough for our sales operation to be profitable at some point our potential home buyers will find their ability to access financing improve when this happens our sales will increase further the  and older buyer who depends on being able to sell their existing single family home and using the equity for their purchase of a manufactured home has been sidelined while waiting for the value of their existing home to increase we are encouraged to see conventional home prices finally rising to prerecession levels we are working hard to once again make home sales on major source of income at umh and we believe that it will return to its full potential as a major profit center as our nations economy continues to improve and at lending standards return to normal and now anna will provide you with greater detail on our results for the quarter anna chew thank you sam core funds from operations or core ffo was  million or  per diluted share for the fourth quarter of  compared to  million

continues to increase and as we upgrade and integrate our acquisitions these expense ratios will continue to improve our lease securities portfolio continued to deliver strong results increasing from  million at yearend  to  million at yearend  representing  of our growth asset value at yearend with an unrealized gains of  million our securities portfolio generated  million in dividend income and  million in net realized gains during the year as we turn to our capital structure at yearend we had approximately  million in debt of which  million was community level mortgage debt at a weightedaverage interest rate of  and  million were loans payable and a weightedaverage interest rate of   of our total debt is fixed rate during the year we have financed refinanced four communities for a total of  million reducing our overall weightedaverage interest rates on our mortgage debt from  to  we are currently in the process of renewing our unsecured credit facility which is set to mature later this year in keeping with our growth strategy this year show us closing in on a  billion total enterprise value during the year we issued  million shares of our  series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock resulting in  million in net proceeds this combined with our additional series b preferred shares and our series a preferred shares resulted in a total of approximately  million in perpetual preferred equity at yearend out total preferred stock combined with an equity market capitalization of  million and our  million in debt results in a total market capitalization of approximately  million at yearend representing a  increase yearoveryear from a credit standpoint our net debt to total market capitalization was  our net debt for securities to total market capitalization was  our fixed charge coverage was  times our net debt to ebitda was  times and our net debt for securities to ebitda was  times from a liquidity standpoint we ended the year with  million in cash and cash equivalents  million in our securities portfolio encumbered by  million in margin loans and  million available on our credit facility which was drawn down subsequent to yearend for the funding of the acquisition of five communities we also have  million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory and now let me turn it over to eugene before we open it up for questions eugene landy thank you anna as founder and chairman of the board of directors i am pleased with the substantial progress umh has made in its longterm strategic business plan at doubledigit annual earnings growth over each of the past four years is an achievement to be proud of umh is part of the housing market we have seen numerous demand tailwinds propelling out industry for a decade the us has been building fewer homes than the  million homes needed to provide for new family formation and the replacement of older homes today the available home inventory is shrinking the deficit in the housing starts ultimately needs to be filled the demographic picture is very favorable the unemployment rate has continued to drop and is now under  wages have begun to rise these factors enhanced household formations by millennials the largest segment of the us population with rising demand comes rising prices the affordability of our homes becomes more and more apparent the future housing and business prospects for umh properties are excellent as sam stated we have reached the point where our dividends are now once again covered by our normalized ffo the free cash flow above and beyond that dividend requirement is the path that ultimately leads to dividend growth we continue to be focused on our business plan and have positioned ourselves to strong growth in  and beyond we will now be happy to take questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from craig kucera of wunderlich please go ahead craig kucera hi good morning guys anna chew good morning craig craig kucera hey there i wanted to talk about the acquisitions you closed on earlier this year can you talk about the goingin cap rates on those acquisitions and just give us some color on maybe how we should think about the incremental expense to clean those communities up maybe this year and even next year eugene landy well firstly instead of goingin cap rates the thing we focus on most is the real estate we are very focused on buying parks that have substantial vacancies and that we can fill those vacancies by purchasing new manufactured homes to use as rental units we of course are conscious when we buy these parks that we want to return our investment and we want to return our investment of between  and  but that return is not the critical factor because the critical factor is the return on our investment after we purchase additional rental units and when we fill the parks and those numbers i believe in the k and annual report sam will cover is the kind of returns we get with all the factors per placed in it would be an overstatement to say that were buying a substantial number of units but nothing but the lots are very valuable the empty space is a very valuable and they are particularly variable if we are enabled to put in homes rent them and do that over process of two or three years as we always point out there are costs involved for some reasons we have to expense the cost of upgrading the parks we bought we have expense a lot of the costs we are getting the lots ready for the rental units and the first year or two the returns we report are not substantial and neither are they significant the returns that we get when we fill these parks with the rental units are very substantial and were very pleased with our program for buying new communities weve gone from  units to â¦ anna chew  eugene landy  weve added about  units to our portfolio and were very pleased with the results of this accretive acquisition program craig kucera okay so i guess let me ask it a bit differently then because i agree i do see the value on the backend but in the near term it was a fairly large  at least from a unit purchase size relative to the portfolio so somewhere  asking it a different way have you seen cap rates move up since the election i know last year you guys were  you didnt acquire as much as you had maybe in the prior year or two and just trying to get a sense of what you are seeing in the market samuel landy the cap rates continue to go down i mean you have to pay more for the properties  itâs sam landy here now you are closer to a five cap six cap on what people are asking on acquisitions but the acquisitions we did in  were exactly what were looking for and usually doing three communities  sites with  lots occupied  occupancy that we looked at the employers surrounding those communities and we looked at the area and were sure that because we have the money to invest in upgrading the properties and adding rental units we will do better than the prior owner the later acquisitions that are  include boardwalk and parke place which thats kind of a rather unusual acquisition for us because those were first class communities boardwalk is  sites  occupied parke place is  sites  occupied both first class communities with swimming pool clubhouse they are  to  cap rates going in but the most important thing to now they adjoin  those two communities are adjoining and they adjoin one of our communities giving us approximately  sites in one location in indiana and when you expand the number of sites if we take a  lot community we make it  every lots more valuable because of the efficiencies of running all those sites from one office so boardwalk and parke place plus the community we already owns there highland will all have topnotch management they will be better able to generate sales income rental income and the value of our existing sites plus those sites will now go up because theyre all together craig kucera got it looking at your capex for this next year i think in  you expected to maybe spend  million on capex can you talk about what your capex plan is for the next year and how many rental units you think you will likely put into the ground samuel landy sure so the capex is  million with  million being the capex for our existing properties and  million for the upgrades to the acquisitions that we just announced and are doing on top of that we hope to add  rental units with the cost of the rental unit plus the setups  a sites of  million that will generate  a year in new income our other capital need with sales increase we finance home sales and we need the money to finance those home sales and were hoping to improve sales in excess of  million with  million of that being financed by us and those are your capital needs craig kucera got it and it looks like post these acquisitions your line of credit is more or less maxed out but you do have room to use the margin or use your borrow on margin against securities is that how we should think about you funding yourself this year and as far as the mortgages rolling off this year is there likely a positive spread between those coming off maybe somewhere in the  range being able to refi maybe in the lowtomid force anna chew hi craig this is anna regarding our line of credit yes it does mature this year but we are in the process of renewing it and expanding it thats number one number two we do have availability on our securities portfolio but donât  we want to be conservative with that so we never take it up to the full availability the third question that you had with regarding the mortgages that are coming off this year and we believe that we will be able to refinance those at approximately i would say between  to  maybe a little lower than the  and also obtain money additional funds from that because some of those are hasnât mortgage for  years and weve had built in gains on those craig kucera got it and one more from me and ill jump back in the queue i guess looking at your rental unit occupancy over the past few quarters it does look like it has dropped a bit yearoveryear and can you give us some color on traffic and maybe how renewals have been trending eugene landy traffics better than ever renewals better than ever the number  factors in new homes setup but not yet occupied factors in acquisition of communities that have rental units that may need upgrading to our standard so everybody i talk out in the field our managers regional managers all say demand is as strong as stronger than ever i know that the rate of our views on our website and the traffic were generating are higher than ever craig kucera all right thanks guys eugene landy thank you operator and the next question comes from brian hollenden of sidoti please go ahead brian hollenden good morning and thanks for taking my call to followup on the last question are you seeing specific pockets of strength in rentals or is the demand broadbased samuel landy well its broadbased but the important point there everything umh did is intentional so first of all our capital structure is intentional which gives us  billion worth of assets with only  million shares outstanding second of all the location of our properties is intentional the marcellus and utica shale area the nashville market the memphis market indiana right now were told that they need  people to come to elkhart indiana to fill the jobs and they dont know where theyre going to house them so every location we went to first of all we know the difficulties and the expense of trying to obtain approved lots thatâs a near impossibility and then we found that these communities were for sale with vacant site due to  i go back to nafta that when we sent manufacturing overseas these jobs left these areas and these communities that were once  occupancy occupied fell down to  occupancy so we were able to purchase these communities and the reason we did it was visiting our own communities that had the same problem we found that the extended stay hotels were  full and we were looking into what was going on and this is seven eight  years ago and we found out about marcellus and utica shale and the fact that there is natural gas and oil in the ground there and that pipelines are being built to bring the natural gas to our ports that pipelines are being built to run the natural gas to the panda plants that generate electricity and the gas is being run to our cities all of this is still in its infancy and the demand for natural gas increases every year the building of factories that will convert natural gas to plastics all of these things are just beginning so this region of the country which had a devastated economy for the past  years may now be one of the fastest growing areas of the country and umh was very fortunate and acted very opportunistically to acquire these communities and we are only starting to show you whats going to happen here eugene landy yes this is gene landy chairman if i could answer what i think is implicit in your question the apartment reits in the united states are doing a wonderful job theyve been building   units they have been building units the cost of  to  a unit they are satisfying demand in the urban areas theyre building studios and one bedroom maybe  of that amount two bedrooms so when you read about whats happening in the apartment area do not transpose that over to the affordable housing area that umh is in we are in a different market we produce  square feet of home two bedrooms three bedrooms and we want them for  a month and the demand is very strong and it is remaining strong so i just wanted to make sure that when you see apartment reits reporting some softness that we are in a completely different market than we are brian hollenden thanks for the color and just have one additional question can you talk about the financing environment for individuals has there been any change in  what specifically could happen in  to improve home sales for individuals samuel landy umh was able to obtain a higher rate of approvals in  working with triad so we were very happy with that but things can still get way better doddfrank the safe act and truth in lending come together to prevent waiters and waitresses from buying houses that they prevent  a person could be coming from a  house they couldnt afford now they want to buy a  house but they have bad credit from the  house theyre prevented from buying a house people with student loans somebody can graduate harvard law school and they have their debt and they can buy a  manufactured home so the rule has come together to absolutely stop us from financing the people who could benefit the most from owning our houses weve spoken directly with both the democratic and the republican leader of the house and the senate everybody agrees their needs to be changed they were unable to do it before the election and hopefully it will get done after the election brian hollenden all right thank you for the color operator operator instructions the next question comes from michael boulgaris of boulgaris investments inc please go ahead michael boulgaris good morning and congratulations on an outstanding year samuel landy thank you michael boulgaris sam hillcrest crossing northeast of pittsburgh has i guess an occupancy of about  according to your i think supplemental can you share with us your expectations of this newly acquired community in the context of the shell petrochemical complex that are currently being built in beaver county samuel landy yes weâve done incredibly well in this area anything near pittsburgh including one of the communities is six miles from the pittsburgh airport so this particular community its not far from shopping malls its not far from highways and it looks like it had  plus really bad years and it is definitely going to take us three four years to turn this around but we bought it for less than the cost of having the land and getting the approvals  per site we purchased it for were going to fix that up add rental units generate home sales and weâll easily make it worth   a site i should take a moment to thank the entire umh staff for the incredible job they did getting us here and we have a vice president and regional manager out there theyve done a tremendous job we just closed on this particular community theyre removing homes every day theyre bringing in the new homes and renting them out theyre going incredibly fast but i would still say its going to take three years to turn it around but were doing an incredible job there part of the reason it takes three years we have to change the reputation of communities and thats probably actually the hardest part that you make your changes the firstyear the secondyear people start to see them and its only the thirdyear that it has a new reputation and the occupancy really starts to increase quickly michael boulgaris and if we could go south a bit you had some challenges with i think the utility company in some of your tennessee expansion can you provide us an update there samuel landy im very happy to tell you that memphis blues is now officially opened six homes are already rented theres  homes fully setup with another  homes being setup in the next four weeks and we expect at the next call we will have most of those occupied eugene landy this is a pioneering project i was actually pleased to hear that one of the largest homebuilders is also doing a similar project so were doing a housing development a conventional housing development except for the fact that were not going to sell the homes were going to rent them and one of the convention homebuilders and we know is doing  homes and is not putting them up for sale but its going to rent  homes and we and memphis with memphis blues will have a brand new community and we will not sell the homes we will rent the homes and we think the  and itâs right in memphis itself itâs a great location and were very optimistic that we can build a community put the homes in and have an allrental community michael boulgaris thank you for that color anna can you break out our home sales for the quarter and give us some sense as to your outlook for the current year in this  inhome sales anna chew sure for the quarter  quarterbyquarter in the first quarter we had about  million in home sales in the second quarter it was about  million in the third quarter it was about  million and in the fourth quarter it was  million for total of  million in home sales of course this is still not up to where it was in prerecessions levels where we have  million in home sales for oneyear and we made  million to  million we would like it to go up it all depends on a lot of things the economy it depends on the regulations and hopefully the regulations will ease as sam has mentioned and that we will go back to the prerecession levels dont forget also that we have more than doubled the size of our portfolio when we had the  million in sales we only had  communities now we have  communities so we believe that if home sales go back up we will really make this a profitable center for umh michael boulgaris okay finally sam perhaps you can speak to the overall momentum of the business heading into  and some of your goals that you have maybe you or gene i know i think congratulations is in order you said you would grow into the dividend and you did but looking forward can you provide us some guidance as to the criteria that the board might employ when considering a dividend boost samuel landy start at the beginning first national shipments for the year up  and we really have to thank the manufacturers all the manufacturers we work with clayton cafko skyline eagle river all the manufacturers they produce a fantastic product the three bedroom two bath beautiful kitchen homes single roof vinyl sided its a great house and our customer  no common wall neighbor above them below them they get it yard they have everything so the demand for the product it goes all the way back to  when the recession of manufactured housing started eventually we lost our distribution network of independent dealers so a lot of people dont really know about the manufactured home product and every day we get that message out more and more more and more people see our houses for the first time and as they get to know the product they readily accept the product and because societies change from wanting to own to wanting to rent they really except the rental product very quickly we rent  homes in a year as per sales the higher rent homes the  and older those people need to be able to sell their existing house and have equity to buy a home and because home prices arising we really see that happening in addition to opening memphis blues we are also in the next month opening up the brookview expansions which is in greenfield just outside saratoga and thats  a lots of houses that are going to sell for well over  so we believe that we have a lot of opportunity to increase the sales income now looking strictly at without the sales income adding  rental units adds  million the current expense ratio is  but what i see is that the expense ratio on the new revenue is even lower than that but however if you factored in between the  rent increase which youve got almost  million in revenues so letâs round that down to  million and we have  million in new rental so you have  million in samestore new revenue thats somewhere around a  expense ratio so we should be able to bring plenty of new income to the bottom line and then as the board weâll have to discuss do you believe you need of cushion in ffo over your dividend or can you dividend be with same as your ffo but to me theres no question the ffo per share is going to increase and were going to be able to make that choice and id add to that fact umh substantially increases the value of properties we own and we have almost  billion in assets with only  million shares outstanding so the increased value in the appreciation i mean somethings got to be done with that and thats got to go somewhere so lets  or something to discuss michael boulgaris thank you for that color and iâll jump back into queue samuel landy thank you operator the next question comes from chris reynolds of neuberger berman please go ahead chris reynolds good morning gentlemen samuel landy hi there chris reynolds i have a general question about the acquisitions that youve made youve been very proactive and grown the company rapidly but i would think that there might be some or a surplus real estate that perhaps could be monetized that might be more suitable to another developer or  and you could free up some cash i think im wondering if thats a possibility or whether everything that youve acquired will be put in operation as you envisioned eugene landy i seldom sell anything and over the years weve seen that we hold on to the parks and they go up and value tremendously we take a much longer term view than most companies we see that the population of the united states is growing maybe by as much as  million a year as there was inflation the areas we are in are excellent and i really dont know of any parks that we would consider selling on top of that you have to understand we have an excellent business plan to monetize the increase in value as long as we have this freddie mac program we will have the private investors with collateralized mortgages we are able if we can increase the value of our parks go back in three four five years later and refinance our parks and weve done that successfully and anna has done a wonderful job of that and have relationship with the lenders are excellent and some of the lending programs are tremendous programs but it does take a while you have to fill the park turn the income around increase the income and then go back in and get a new mortgage and when you get the new mortgage you have an awful lot of cash we are buying our rental units weve invested as much as over  million in rental units and weve done that to the preferred stock to refinancing and as we see it two three years from now were going to refinance a lot of our products and generate an awful lot of cash so we see no reason to try to generate cash by selling off our assets samuel landy i just want to point out we are in the process of  were being approached about marcellus shale leases again where people will pay us per acre for drilling rigs and then you get a percentage we are getting approvals for additional sub storage units on our vacant land and expect to increase our number of sub storage units to a  units in the next three years and we do look at the vacant land constantly to look at the best vacant land in terms of its highest and best use and we wouldnt be opposed to  we have a piece across from our hospitals that might be a good piece to build a medical office so we look at that and we consider what to do with it but at this time the vacant land is sitting there chris reynolds okay well terrific keep up the good work very impressive results samuel landy thank you eugene landy thank you operator operator instructions this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back

landyreviewed by samuel landyratingon  november last modified april summaryblack ops  is an incredible call of duty game and may just be the best yet it distances itself from previous entries with the risks it takes and it pays off the three year gap between games from treyarch has worked in their favourmore details call of duty black ops  is the direct sequel to developer treyarchâs black ops  from  in the  years between releases a lot has happened with the call of duty franchise infinity ward fellow developer of the sibling call of duty modern warfare series imploded sledgehammer games then came on board codeveloping modern warfare  and eventually going on to develop advanced warfare propelling the series into the future and a science fiction setting what does this mean for black ops  as ever treyarch have thrown content upon content into the game giving it extreme value for money its campaign is a departure in its execution multiplayer is as frenetic as ever zombieâs returns in all its glory and there are a few extra additions to surprise the player with the campaign is substantial by call of duty standards and runs just over six hours it deals with what happens to humans when robotics are left unchecked and paints a rather scary picture of a possible future here we come across several of the new innovations to the franchise at the beginning you are asked to create a character you can choose your gender for the first time in the series history and also choose from several different faces to give your character minimal customization itâs not on the level of bloodborne but it is a nice touch that adds to the level of investment usually not present in the games campaign from here you start your standard runandgun mission running through a level and dispatching a lot of bad guys trying to get to the end of the level at the end of the level you find yourself in circumstances that leave you in a state that requires the character to upgrade his or her body with robotics setting the player up for the rest of the story while previous black ops games have dealt with drugs brainwashing mkultra and trippy hallucinations black ops  deals with what happens when the human mind is integrated with the direct neural interface that controls the robotics achieving a similar effect on the gameplay side of things once you get past the initial stages you are set up in a hub world here you can choose your load out select the next mission from several different choices and play around with the new cyber cores these cyber cores regulate what powers the player has going into the next mission they are divided into three types control martial and chaos control focuses on hacking whether it be enemy robots and drones or turrets and computers martial supercharges the player melee combat giving additional powers that help the player get up close and personal in a fight and rip apart the enemy chaos deals with what the game terms âpsychological warfareâ turning and using the enemies gear against them while this gives more depth and thought to the missions the choice is incredibly important because the player usually wonât have enough points to level up all three cores and once youâve chosen your core youâre locked in for that mission the same applies to weapons weapons in black ops  are registered to a single individual and can only be used by that one person choice is paramount my preferred core was martial as it was equipped with abilities that dealt with both robotic and human enemies evenly that being said the issue of being locked into a specific loadout is easily addressed if you have friends to play with campaign can be played cooperatively with up to three other friends meaning that each of you can play a different role depending on the cyber core chosen in a lot of instances coop felt like it was the preferred option as the levels are rather large and long and it can become monotonous fighting waves of enemies by yourself once the campaign is finished a zombieâs version of the campaign is unlocked itâs a fun quirky take on the main story but in end isnât as well fleshed out as it could have been multiplayer is where black ops  really shines from the onset the player will recognise change you are asked to pick a specialist to play as each specialist is different in that they have one unique power and weapon that you must choose from it is these unique powers and weapons that make each specialist different otherwise they play exactly the same one is a crack shot archer the other can get a speed boost while another can equip a shock rifle it never feels uneven because everyone has access to some type of power in the gameÂ  the pick system is back and for the better the pick system allots the player ten points from which they can assign different weapon attachments grenades perks and so on this complemented with the powers of the specialists gives a very even handed feel to multiplayer on top of this there is a whole new level of manoeuvrability that adds to the chaos of the already frantic multiplayer the thruster pack is now restricted usually to two jumps or a combination of power slide and jump before it needs to recharge what you get instead is the ability to fire your weapon whenever you want you can fire it power sliding you can fire it jumping you can fire it running whether on the ground or along the walls thatâs right black ops  now allows the player to run along walls standard game modes return such as team deathmatch capture the flag and domination as well as some fan favourites such as kill confirmed and uplink but the noted absences of moshpit is a shame while call of duty multiplayer has become known for twelve year olds screaming obscenities through a mic at people the multiplayer is balanced and fine tuned to the point where it is easily addictive multiplayer in black ops  just feels right it takes the ideas that were present in advanced warfare and pushes them to the extreme zombies is back as well and in much better form than what passed for the game mode in advanced warfare this time the players take the roles of four citizens from morg city the characters are played by ron perlman heather graham neal mcdonough and jeff goldblum and the actors do an excellent job of bringing them to life in the way that they interact with each other and the world around them there is a complete levelling system which works much better than it did in black ops  as well as the ability to upgrade guns that youâll find on the wall and pick your perk load out in the small confined streets of morg city it is easy to get corned and beaten down by zombies but a good team who works together can chop through them and get to the higher levels also making a return is dead ops arcade which is hidden somewhere within the campaign it plays much the same as the original but like everything in black ops  ups the ante itâs bigger and longer adding new pickups and weapons to help battle the new cosmic silverback another addition to the package is the free run mode this allows the player to run through speed trials using the new manoeuvrability system of the game it also acts as a good training simulator for the multiplayer helping you to practise those tricky moves all in all black ops  is an incredible call of duty game and may just be the best yet it distances itself from previous entries with the risks it takes and it pays off the three year gap between games from treyarch has worked in their favour they have crafted an engaging campaign with its playability the multiplayer is tight as ever and zombies is returned to its former glory this is definitely worth the bang for the buck now if you excuse me
