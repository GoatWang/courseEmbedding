is for you it is not a one dimensional show either clyde is good at varying the topics yet maintaining updates on current events i do not agree with  of the content that is presented by him and callers but thats the beauty of the show information is presented and you the listener make an informed decision for yourself i respect the heck out of clyde for allowing his listeners to come to their own conclusions about the info presented i havent missed a show in about a year  date published  rated  out of  by chad from introduced to something better i believe the shows to be very intriguing and entertaining and one of the most informative shows that is on anywhere i also like the way he stands up for what he believes in and doesnt just pacify every person that wants to challenge what he may be speaking about for that day at first i was truly upset that they introduced ground zero on my local radio station due to the fact that they played it in the spot where the coast to coast with george noorey played their shows previous nights show this upset me because that was the only chance i got to listen to coast to coast but after listening to ground zero for awhile i really liked it even better now ground zero is all i ever listen to while driving thanks to stitcher date published  rated  out of  by tc from great show i found this show about  months ago i listen almost every nightif its not live i listen to a repeat show i always learn something new  i would compare it to the art bell days of coast to coast very entertaining informative and it always makes me think about things with a new perspective it causes me to think and thats a good thing  date published  rated  out of  by duckbutt from re the ground zero team i first found out about this show in prison and listened to it on am  in northern connecticut and was and still am deeply impressed with the truthfulness and diversity of the topics that mainstream media were not covering mr lewis is a very well educated well spoken and isnt afraid to speak his mind regarding the truth i thank not only mr lewis but the entire ground zero team for not just putting on a great show but for being one of the few shows to actually do the research and know what theyre talking about keep up the fantastic work date published  rated  out of  by oxcart from clyde lewis is simply amazing to say ground zero
