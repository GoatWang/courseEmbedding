size print superior court of pennsylvania gilbert and lois goldstein appellants v phillip morris incorporated appellee     decided july  00 before  del sole pj hudock and todd jjsherri l eyer philadelphia for appellants joseph k hetrick philadelphia for appellee ¶  gilbert and lois goldstein appeal from the orders granting summary judgment in favor of philip morris incorporated pmi   upon review we affirm¶  the goldsteins filed this products liability case on july     gilbert goldstein was diagnosed with lung cancer after more than thirty years of smoking pmis cigarettes   in their complaint appellants assert causes of action in strict liability negligence and conspiracy   the strict liability and negligence claims were based on theories of both inadequate warnings and design defect   in their civil conspiracy claim appellants allege that pmi conspired with other cigarette manufacturers to knowingly market a deadly defective product while concealing from the public the risks attendant to its use¶  pmi filed three motions for summary judgment in response to appellants claims and a motion to strike portions of the affidavits of the appellants expert witness allan feingold md   the trial court granted pmis motions for summary judgment and their motion to strike portions of the affidavit   as a result appellants complaint was dismissed in its entirety   appellants timely appealed the courts orders¶  on appeal appellants present the following issues for our reviewi  did the lower court err in finding as a matter of law that the record evidence demonstrated that plaintiff if given an adequate warning of the health hazards associated with the use of defendants marlboro cigarettes would not have heeded themii did the lower court err in granting defendants motion to strike the affidavits of plaintiffs expert witness dr allan feingold especially without a hearing thereoniii did the lower court improperly dismiss plaintiffs design defect claims on the basis of comment i of the restatement second of torts and applicable pennsylvania authority especially where plaintiffs produced evidence of a feasible alternative design for cigarettes which is not even a necessary element of a design defect caseiv did the lower court err in dismissing plaintiffs civil conspiracy claim and improperly requiring plaintiffs to produce evidence of an underlying criminal act or intentional tort and further in finding that plaintiffs evidence did not establish the element of maliceappellants brief at ¶  our scope of review in an appeal from summary judgment is plenary   lange v burd 00 ad   pasuper00   we must view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine whether the moving party has established that there exists no genuine issue of material fact and that it is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law  id quoting from davis v resources for human dev inc 0 ad   pasuper00 ¶  first appellants argue that the trial court erred in dismissing appellants prejuly   failure to warn claims   appellants brief at    appellants maintain that this court has adopted the heeding presumption in failure to warn cases  id at    appellants assert that with regard to this presumption in cases that involve the lack of warnings or inadequate warnings a presumption arises that the plaintiff would have followed an adequate warning  id  accordingly appellants assert that only after defendant has produced evidence that the injured plaintiff was aware of the risk of bodily injury or to the extent to which his conduct could contribute to that risk is the presumption rebutted  id at    here appellants maintain no record evidence sufficiently rebutted this presumption  id at    specifically appellants contend that gilbert goldstein was not fully aware of the risk of bodily injury and addiction  id¶  we first note that this court recently has had occasion to address this issue in a case very similar to the one sub judice   in viguers v philip morris usa inc  ad  pasuper00 we held that while the heeding presumption has been authorized in asbestos cases in pennsylvania it does not apply in the context of this case which involves the voluntary choice of a smoker to begin and continue smoking tobacco   viguers  ad at  ¶  but even assuming arguendo that the presumption applies in this case we agree with the trial court that the presumption was rebutted by uncontradicted evidence that gilbert goldstein would not have heeded a warning had it been given prior to accordingly if the defendant produces evidence that the injured plaintiff was “fully aware of the risk of bodily injury or the extent to which his conduct could contribute to that risk” then the presumption is rebutted and the burden of production shifts back to the plaintiff to produce evidence that he would have acted to avoid the underlying hazard had the defendant provided an adequate warningcoward v owenscorning fiberglas corp  ad   pasuper   in order to rebut the heeding presumption the defendant need only produce evidence “sufficient to support a finding contrary to the presumed fact”  coward  ad at ¶  in this case the record contained evidence that gilbert goldstein continued smoking long after federallymandated warnings of the dangers of cigarette smoking appeared on packages in    indeed he did not quit smoking until    the trial court correctly held that this evidence adequately rebutted any presumption that gilbert would have quit smoking if pmi had earlier warned of the dangers of its product   the burden of proof then shifted back to appellants to show that warnings would have changed gilberts behavior and we affirm the trial courts decision that appellants did not produce evidence to meet this burden as a matter of law ¶ 0 next appellants argue that the trial court erred in striking the affidavit and paragraphs    and  of the supplemental affidavit of their expert witness dr allan feingold   appellants brief at    dr feingolds affidavit was intended to provide evidence that would allow appellants to carry their burden of proof on the strict liability claim   feingold would have testified in pertinent part that   cigarettes sold under the brand name marlboro are defective and unreasonably dangerous because they deliver excessive amounts of carcinogens and other harmful ingredients they are engineered for inhalation and they deliver harmful and addictive quantities of nicotine   medical literature contains abundant references to the various methods that were available to pmi to reduce its cigarettes harmful potential  and  reduced hazard products were feasibly designed and sold  id at ¶  in viguers this court addressed an identical issue involving dr feingold   in viguers dr feingolds proposed testimony was almost identical to the proposed testimony in the case sub judice   in viguers we held that feingold was not qualified to give his opinion regarding the defective design of pmis cigarettes and the feasibility of safer cigarette alternatives because he had no expertise in the design and manufacture of cigarettes  viguers  ad at 0   we note that there is no indication that dr feingolds experience has changed since the holding in viguers   thus we conclude that feingold is not qualified to give his opinion on the defective design of pmis cigarettes and the feasibility of safer cigarette alternatives   the trial court did not err in granting pmis motion to strike feingolds affidavit and certain paragraphs of his supplemental affidavit ¶  appellants next argue that the trial court erred in concluding that appellants design defect claims were based on the inherent qualities of tobacco   appellants brief at    consequently appellants maintain the trial court erroneously dismissed appellants design defect claims  id appellants also argue that hite gunsalus and miller do not apply because unlike the appellants in those cases appellants here have identified specific defects in marlboro cigarettes  id at ¶  in hite v rj reynolds tobacco co  pasuper   ad  0 this court rejected claims that cigarette companies could be held liable merely for manufacturing a legal and regulated product with inherent risks   in dismissing appellants design defect claim this court explainedsection 0a recognizes liability without fault and properly limits such liability to defective products   the seller of a product is not responsible for harm caused by such inherently dangerous products as whiskey or knives that despite perfection in manufacture design or distribution can cause injuryhite  ad at 0   in considering the merits of appellants design defect claim in hite we heldappellant in the instant case does not contend that a better design is available for the cigarette companys product   she contends only that appellees product is so inherently dangerous that the manufacturer should be made liable for the mischief it causes   she would accomplish this by applying the riskutility approach to design defect cases   thus far however the pennsylvania courts have resisted such an approach in design defect cases․ the risk of loss will not be placed on the supplier or manufacturer where an inherent danger is within the contemplation of the buyer ie where there is no element which will remove the risks inherent in its intended usehite  ad at ¶  the federal courts have recognized the pennsylvania supreme courts refusal to embrace the riskutility analysis and have held that cigarette claims based upon such an approach are not cognizable in pennsylvania   see miller v brown  williamson tobacco corp  fsupp  edpa under pennsylvania law the riskutility theory of liability was inapplicable and therefore an action against a cigarette manufacturer for death caused by cigarette smoking on grounds that cigarettes gave no benefit to society but imposed great risk could not be maintained  gunsalus v celotex corp  fsupp  edpa tobacco was not per se a “defective” product merely because it caused or increased the risk of lung cancer and other life threatening diseases¶  as we noted earlier dr feingolds affidavit and parts of his supplemental affidavits were properly struck by the trial court   thus the appellant had no means of establishing alleged specific defects in the cigarettes¶  moreover as referenced earlier dr feingold if permitted would have testified that   cigarettes sold under the brand name marlboro are defective and unreasonably dangerous because they deliver excessive amounts of carcinogens and other harmful ingredients they are engineered for inhalation and they deliver harmful and addictive quantities of nicotine   medical literature contains abundant references to the various methods that were available to pmi to reduce its cigarettes harmful potential  and  reduced hazard products were feasibly designed and sold   the defects identified by dr feingold are nothing more than a recitation of the inherent and known risks associated with smoking any cigarette¶  additionally appellants attempt to circumvent the holding of hite and its progeny by asserting that a better design was available   appellants brief at    appellants however failed to establish that these alternatives were technically feasible from 0 through  the time during which gilbert smoked that they were commercially feasible or that they were in fact safer than conventional cigarettes   with regard to the noncombustible cigarettes that appellants cite to  this is not evidence of a better design   if these cigarettes were in fact manufactured at some point they were not the same product and cannot be argued to be a better design of the cigarettes gilbert was smoking   the fact that these cigarettes were not the same product and therefore could not be characterized as a better design is evidenced by their existence and gilberts refusal to smoke them   thus we find appellants argument that this case is not controlled by the precedent of hite gunsalus and miller to be unpersuasive   we find no error in the trial courts dismissal of appellants claims¶  additionally we find absolutely no merit to appellants claim that comment i of the restatement of torts § 0a has never been adopted by the pennsylvania supreme court as precedent and that comment i is inapplicable here   on the contrary we find that pennsylvania courts have unflinchingly affirmed the mandates provided by section 0a and its accompanying comments   see azzarello v black bros co 0 pa   ad 00  employing 0a and comment i to determine whether product was defective  hite v rj reynolds tobacco co  pasuper   ad  0 discussing the applicability of a riskutility analysis in a 0a action with regard to cigarettes  lewis v coffing hoist div duffnorton co  pa   ad 0  discussing whether evidence of industry standards is properly admissible in a 0a action ¶  finally appellants argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their civil conspiracy claim   appellants brief at    appellants maintain that they established all necessary elements for such a claim  id ¶ 0 in order to state a civil action for conspiracy a complaint must allege  a combination of two or more persons acting with a common purpose to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means or for an unlawful purpose   an overt act done in pursuance of the common purpose  and  actual legal damage  mckeeman v corestates bank na  ad  0 pasuper   additionally “absent a civil cause of action for a particular act there can be no cause of action for civil conspiracy to commit that act”  mckeeman  ad at 0   proof of malice is an essential part of a cause of action for conspiracy  burnside v abbott laboratories  pasuper  0 ad  0   “the mere fact that two or more persons each with the right to do a thing happen to do that thing at the same time is not by itself an actionable conspiracy”   burnside 0 ad at 0¶  in the case sub judice the appellants have failed to plead or develop any separate underlying intentional or criminal act that can support a civil conspiracy claim   strict liability and negligence counts are insufficient to support their civil conspiracy claim   see burnside v abbott labs  pasuper  0 ad  0    thus this claim could be dismissed on this basis alone ¶  if appellants complaint was construed to allege fraud we find this claim would still fail  to recover on a claim of fraud the plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence six elements   a representation   which is material to the transaction at hand   made falsely with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to whether it is true or false   with the intent of misleading another into relying on it   justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation  and  the resulting injury was proximately caused by the reliance  debbs v chrysler corp 0 ad   pasuper00 citations omitted¶  as discussed previously appellants did not make out their case that a failure to warn even a fraudulent failure to warn or that a defectively designed cigarette even fraudulently designed caused gilberts cancer   we therefore find no error in the trial courts decision to dismiss the conspiracy claim¶  orders affirmedfootnotes   see coward v owenscorning fiberglas corp  ad   pasuper  lonasco v abest products co  ad  pasuper   although appellants do not set forth a separately named count for “fraud” the facts enumerated in the civil conspiracy claim do describe

burden of proof then shifted back to appellants to show that warnings would have changed gilberts behavior and we affirm the trial courts decision that appellants did not produce evidence to meet this burden as a matter of law ¶ 0 next appellants argue that the trial court erred in striking the affidavit and paragraphs    and  of the supplemental affidavit of their expert witness dr allan feingold appellants brief at  dr feingolds affidavit was intended to provide evidence that would allow appellants to carry their burden of proof on the strict liability claim feingold would have testified in pertinent part that  cigarettes sold under the brand name marlboro are defective and unreasonably dangerous because they deliver excessive amounts of carcinogens and other harmful ingredients they are engineered for inhalation and they deliver harmful and addictive quantities of nicotine  medical literature contains abundant references to the various methods that were available to pmi to reduce its cigarettes harmful potential and  reduced hazard products were feasibly designed and sold id at  ¶  in viguers this court addressed an identical issue involving dr feingold in viguers dr feingolds proposed testimony was almost identical to the proposed testimony in the case sub judice in viguers we held that feingold was not qualified to give his opinion regarding the defective design of pmis cigarettes and the feasibility of safer cigarette alternatives because he had no expertise in the design and manufacture of cigarettes viguers  ad at 0 we note that there is no indication that dr feingolds experience has changed since the holding in viguers thus we conclude that feingold is not qualified to give his opinion on the defective design of pmis cigarettes and the feasibility of safer cigarette alternatives the trial court did not err in granting pmis motion to strike feingolds affidavit and certain paragraphs of his supplemental affidavit ¶  appellants next argue that the trial court erred in concluding that appellants design defect claims were based on the inherent qualities of tobacco appellants brief at  consequently appellants maintain the trial court erroneously dismissed appellants design defect claims id appellants also argue that hite gunsalus and miller do not apply because unlike the appellants in those cases appellants  here have identified specific defects in marlboro cigarettes id at  ¶  in hite v rj reynolds tobacco co  pasuper   ad  0 this court rejected claims that cigarette companies could be held liable merely for manufacturing a legal and regulated product with inherent risks in dismissing appellants design defect claim this court explained section 0a recognizes liability without fault and properly limits such liability to defective products the seller of a product is not responsible for harm caused by such inherently dangerous products as whiskey or knives that despite perfection in manufacture design or distribution can cause injury hite  ad at 0 in considering the merits of appellants design defect claim in hite we held appellant in the instant case does not contend that a better design is available for the cigarette companys product she contends only that appellees product is so inherently dangerous that the manufacturer should be made liable for the mischief it causes she would accomplish this by applying the riskutility approach to design defect cases thus far however the pennsylvania courts have resisted such an approach in design defect cases the risk of loss will not be placed on the supplier or manufacturer where an inherent danger is within the contemplation of the buyer ie where there is no element which will remove the risks inherent in its intended use hite  ad at  ¶  the federal courts have recognized the pennsylvania supreme courts refusal to embrace the riskutility analysis and have held that cigarette claims based upon such an approach are not cognizable in pennsylvania see miller v brown  williamson tobacco corp  f supp  edpa under pennsylvania law the riskutility theory of liability was inapplicable and therefore an action against a cigarette manufacturer for death caused by cigarette smoking on grounds that cigarettes gave no benefit to society but imposed great risk could not be maintained gunsalus v celotex corp  f supp  edpa tobacco was not per se a defective product merely because it caused or increased the risk of lung cancer and other life threatening diseases ¶  as we noted earlier dr feingolds affidavit and parts of his supplemental affidavits were properly struck by the trial court thus the appellant had no means of establishing alleged specific defects in the cigarettes ¶  moreover as referenced earlier dr feingold if permitted would have testified that  cigarettes sold under the brand name marlboro are defective and unreasonably dangerous because they deliver excessive amounts of carcinogens and other harmful ingredients they are engineered for inhalation and they deliver harmful and addictive quantities of nicotine  medical literature contains abundant references to the various methods that were available to pmi to reduce its cigarettes harmful potential and  reduced hazard products were feasibly designed and sold the defects identified by dr feingold are nothing more than a recitation of the inherent and known risks associated with smoking any cigarette ¶  additionally appellants attempt to circumvent the holding of hite and its progeny by asserting that a better design was available appellants brief at  appellants however failed to establish that these alternatives were technically feasible from 0 through  the time during which gilbert smoked that they 0 were commercially feasible or that they were in fact safer than conventional cigarettes with regard to the noncombustible cigarettes that appellants cite to this is not evidence of a better design if these cigarettes were in fact manufactured at some point they were not the same product and cannot be argued to be a better design of the cigarettes gilbert was smoking the fact that these cigarettes were not the same product and therefore could not be characterized as a better design is evidenced by their existence and gilberts refusal to smoke them thus we find appellants argument that this case is not controlled by the precedent of hite gunsalus and miller to be unpersuasive we find no error in the trial courts dismissal of appellants claims ¶  additionally we find absolutely no merit to appellants claim that comment i of the restatement of torts § 0a has never been adopted by the pennsylvania supreme court as precedent and that comment i is inapplicable here on the contrary we find that pennsylvania courts have unflinchingly affirmed the mandates provided by section 0a and its accompanying comments see azzarello v black bros co 0 pa   ad 00  employing 0a and comment i to determine whether product was defective hite v rj reynolds tobacco co  pasuper   ad  0 discussing the applicability of a riskutility analysis in a 0a action with regard to cigarettes lewis v coffing hoist div duffnorton co  pa   ad 0  discussing whether evidence of industry standards is properly admissible in a 0a action ¶  finally appellants argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their civil conspiracy claim appellants brief at  appellants maintain that they established all necessary elements for such a claim id ¶ 0 in order to state a civil action for conspiracy a complaint must allege  a combination of two or more persons acting with a common purpose to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means or for an unlawful purpose  an overt act done in pursuance of the common purpose and  actual legal damage mckeeman v corestates bank na  ad  0 pasuper additionally absent a civil cause of action for a particular act there can be no cause of action for civil conspiracy to commit that act mckeeman  ad at 0 proof of malice is an essential part of a cause of action for conspiracy burnside v abbott laboratories  pasuper  0 ad  0  the mere fact that two or more persons each with the right to do a thing happen to do that thing at the same time is not by itself an actionable conspiracy burnside 0 ad at 0 ¶  in the case sub judice the appellants have failed to plead or develop any separate underlying intentional or criminal act that can support a civil conspiracy claim strict liability and negligence counts are insufficient to support their civil conspiracy claim see burnside v abbott labs  pasuper  0 ad  0  thus this claim could be dismissed on this basis alone ¶  if appellants complaint was construed to allege fraud we find this claim would still fail to recover on a claim of fraud the plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence six elements   a representation  which is material to the transaction at hand  made falsely with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to whether it is true or false  with the intent of misleading another into relying on it  justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation and  the resulting injury was proximately caused by the reliance debbs v chrysler corp 0 ad   pasuper00 citations omitted ¶  as discussed previously appellants did not make out their case that a failure to warn even a fraudulent failure to warn or that a defectively designed cigarette even fraudulently designed caused gilberts cancer we therefore find no error in the trial courts decision to dismiss the conspiracy claim ¶  orders affirmed notes  see coward v owenscorning fiberglas corp  ad   pasuper lonasco v abest products co  ad  pasuper  although appellants do not set forth a separately named count for fraud the facts enumerated in the civil conspiracy claim do describe alleged incidents of misrepresentation false statements omissions and suppressions upon which gilbert allegedly relied philip goldstein search our site home
