was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the real benefactors of the world a bust of watt is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling patents watt was the sole inventor listed on his six patents patent  a method of

 august and being buried on  september the date  august originates from the biography the life of james watt  p  by james patrick muirhead it draws its supposed legitimacy from the fact that muirhead was a nephew of watt and therefore should have been wellinformed in the muirhead papers  august date is mentioned elsewhere the latter date is also given in contemporary newspaper reports for example

was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the real benefactors of the world a bust of watt is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling patents watt was the sole inventor listed on his six patents patent  a method of

indicator diagram with john southern influences thomas newcomen joseph black adam smith john robison physicist john roebuck james keir signature james watt frs frse  january   january  os –  august  was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he developed the concept of horsepower and the si unit of power the watt was named after him contents  biography  watt and the kettle  early experiments with steam  first engines  patent trials  copying

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the real benefactors of the world a bust of watt is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling patents watt was the sole inventor listed on his six patents patent  a method of

was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the

indicator diagram with john southern influences thomas newcomen joseph black adam smith john robison physicist john roebuck james keir signature james watt frs frse  january   january  os –  august  was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he developed the concept of horsepower and the si unit of power the watt was named after him contents  biography  watt and the kettle  early experiments with steam  first engines  patent trials  copying

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the real benefactors of the world a bust of watt is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling patents watt was the sole inventor listed on his six patents patent  a method of

 august and being buried on  september the date  august originates from the biography the life of james watt  p  by james patrick muirhead it draws its supposed legitimacy from the fact that muirhead was a nephew of watt and therefore should have been wellinformed in the muirhead papers  august date is mentioned elsewhere the latter date is also given in contemporary newspaper reports for example

indicator diagram with john southern influences thomas newcomen joseph black adam smith john robison physicist john roebuck james keir signature james watt frs frse  january   january  os –  august  was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he developed the concept of horsepower and the si unit of power the watt was named after him contents  biography  watt and the kettle  early experiments with steam  first engines  patent trials  copying

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was

indicator diagram with john southern influences thomas newcomen joseph black adam smith john robison physicist john roebuck james keir signature james watt frs frse  january   january  os –  august  was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he developed the concept of horsepower and the si unit of power the watt was named after him contents  biography  watt and the kettle  early experiments with steam  first engines  patent trials  copying

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has

inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the real benefactors of the world a bust of watt is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling patents watt was the sole inventor listed on his six patents patent  a method of

specification was accepted on  june  and enrolled on  july  notes  a b although a number of otherwise reputable sources give his date of death as  august  all contemporary accounts report him dying on  august and being buried on  september the date  august originates from the biography the life of james watt  p  by james patrick muirhead it draws its supposed legitimacy from the fact that muirhead was a nephew of watt and therefore should have been wellinformed in the muirhead papers  august date is mentioned elsewhere the latter date is also given in contemporary newspaper reports for example

watt  history tv skip to main content search bios james watt scotsman james watt helped take us from the farm to the factory and into the modern world though a truly awful businessman he was the ingenious engineering power behind the industrial revolution at the start of the th century in the poor scottish seaport town of greenock the grandfather of james watt sets up a school of mathematics his son becomes a prosperous shipbuilder and provider of shipping products his unique selling point is his ‘skill in the making of the most delicate instruments’ it attracts much business and the hand in marriage of agnes muirhead a gentle lady descended from a long line of noble scots ‘fortune at his finger ends’when james watt is born on  january  his future life seems rosy and to begin with it is his educated mother home schools him as his father’s business run from their backyard expands his father gives him his own small tool kit his hobbies include deconstructing and reassembling his toys he sometimes creates new ones out of the parts one of his father’s workmen correctly notes that ‘jamie’ as all his friends will call him has a ‘fortune at his finger ends’ a family anecdote has it that he is chided for his fascination with a steaming kettle it will be his combination of observation and practical application that will revolutionise britain and the world hard timesbut then a series of commercial disasters including the loss of a valuable ship wrecks his inheritance james has to learn a trade to survive his father’s health starts to fail as fast as his business in  aged  his beloved mother dies so in the summer of  james sets off spending twelve days on horseback to reach london and its promise of wealth the teenager combines his father and grandfather’s skills when he makes mathematical instruments such as brass scales and parallelrulers after working himself until he becomes ill he returns to glasgow in autumn  you wattwatt hopes that as he is literally the only mathematical instrument maker in the whole of scotland he will find work but the guild of hammermen representing anyone who works with metal blocks his employment they state he cannot work until he has done more apprentice time they obviously however have no one who to whom he can apprentice there being no one with watt’s speciality it will be not the last time that watt has to wait for the world to catch up with him thankfully university professors employ him privately to repair their academic instruments he supplements this income by making and selling everything from spectacles to fiddles flutes and guitars having no musical ability he studies the science of harmony the precision products he creates are considered better instruments than those crafted by music specialists give me steamthe university provide a small shop from which he can work and sell from and it soon becomes a hangout for professors and public alike more of an engineer than entrepreneur he sets up business with john craig and over the next six years they manufacture musical instruments and toys during this time he’s befriended by the legendary economist adam smith smith’s writings will be the bible for capitalism watt’s work will be its engine in  watt is introduced to john later professor robinson robinson will introduce him to the science of steam as the university has little to none of the necessary apparatus and appliances necessary to experiment with steam watt makes them in  the university ask him to repair one of their newcomen steam engines this steam powered engine was invented by english engineers savery and newcomen it is the first practical device to use steam power to produce mechanical work watt realises it’s also horrendously inefficient for several decades it’s been used in mines to pump out water with little design improvements in over a half a century watt sees a lot of potential with huge profits to be made but most of the literature available on the subject is in french and italian so watt learns those languages his subsequent steam experiments reveal the revolutionary theory of latent heat simplistically the ‘hidden’ heat and energy in steam with it he’ll eventually be able to increase the power of the steam engine fivefold only then does he find out that another resident professor robert black has already discovered the theory he has in fact been teaching it to his students for several years the two pair up black will become both an academic and financial support his other partnership in  is to his cousin margaret miller she helps calm his ‘nervous headaches’ they will have five children but only two will make it to adulthood watt’s continues to experiment and realises that the newcomen model wastes around three quarters of its heat to achieve the mechanical motion its parts the piston and chamber were constantly being cooled and heated more energy was being expended on this than on delivering mechanical force brilliant but brokeout walking one sunday afternoon in  watt sees the solution he envisions a separate chamber in which the steam can condense this means no more need for cooling and reheating making the engine faster and more fuel efficient his insights will convert a machine of limited use into one that will power the industrial revolution but the fact that his vision may forever change the world is of little use to watthe is broke and deeply in debt so robert black introduces him to british inventor john roebuck roebuck finances watt’s research to make a working model he pays off watt’s debts in return for two thirds ownership of watt’s invention but few machinists have the deftness of touch watt’s father had in making instruments watt once again has to wait for the world to catch up with him he works as a surveyor and as a civil engineer professions he finds dull and undemanding to supplement his income the scientific literature he needs to understand to make the next quantum leap is all in german so he learns this and italian the constant obstacles  even securing a patent proves problematic – begin to take their toll he starts to suffer from insomnia and deep depression only his wife keeps him together his first patent covering the condenser in january  is both a scientific and a personal turning point legally protected he still spends the next six months working in secret to produce a workable model half a year later he tests it it fails twice but the escaping steam doesn’t this time depress watt he’s convinced his model will work he’s sure it’s the lack of accuracy and precision by the mechanics that is causing his model to fail this is a rare case of a genius blaming correctly his bad workmen as everything has to be done by hand and by eye the lack of skilled – and sober – workmen will plague watt throughout his life harder timesthen his backer roebuck goes bust roebuck’s wealth came from mining and his mines are waterlogged he’d hoped watt’s improved design would rectify this but with no working model roebuck’s wealth ran out watt’s future once again looks bleak then in  his one constant supporter his wife margaret dies in childbirth watt is his lowest he’s approaching  a widower with dependents who is deep in debt it’s then that he meets matthew boulton a birmingham based businessman boulton acquires roebuck’s concerns including watt’s patent it’s actually the break watt needs boutlon has access to the precision boring and instrument making watt’s vision requires watt goes to work there in may  the two will work together for the next quarter of a century full steam aheadboulton  watt manufacture his steam engine design and their first customers come from the mines purchasers are happy to pay for an engine that uses just one third of the coal needed by the newcomen model watt exhausts himself travelling the country personally ensuring each machine’s success but boulton often follows as many exploit watt’s appalling business sense in  watt marries again and the couple have two children watt will outlive them both but the new mrs watt will grow old and happy and rich with her new husband in birmingham and despite being the business brains in the operation it’s boulton who in  proposes to watt the potential for other applications he suggests his engines could grind or weave and more with the up and down piston movement converted to rotary movement soon paper flour cotton and iron mills are all powered by watt’s engines industrial espionageboulton  watt become the goto engineering company in the country such is their success that germany and france attempt industrial espionage to try to secure their watt’s plans for his next generation of steam engines boulton  watt employ one edward bull to construct engines for them it will be a costly salary bull goes off to make his own versions but he was not the first to betray watt one of boulton’s workmen hatley had already sold off watt’s blueprints another cartwright later hanged stole another of his ideas and sold it on some companies stop their payments to watt believing his patent unenforceable others argue watt has created an illegal monopoly watt will sue bull and he’ll win but bull is just one of many that watt has to pursue and though ultimately profitable it will be a long and costly process just one solicitor’s bill in today’s money was for nearly £ despite this boutlon  watt set up one of the first benefit societies for their workmen it was said that not one member ever had to rely on begging or charity ‘except a few irreclaimable drunkards’ in  watt makes further improvements to the steam engine and patents a steam locomotive by  boulton  watt are worldwide celebrities they’re so feted that watt describes being ‘drunk from morning to night with burgundy and undeserved praise’by  both boulton  watt are wealthy men running out of steamin  they retire and hand their business over to their sons tragically watt’s son gregory dies just four years later watt’s remaining years are devoted to research in  he pays one last visit to the place of his birth greenock then aged  he dies on  august  in heathfield england he is buried alongside his business partner in life matthew boulton in  the watt a unit of measurement of electrical and mechanical power is named in his honour today his name lights up on nearly every light bulb in the world

most important stages the industrial revolution it all started when he traveled to england to become a mechanic then he decided to come back to scotland this is where he met joseph black black though him some thing that he found interesting about steam this got watt started in thinking about how to make newcomms steam engine better so in  he got his first real challenge he got one of newcomms

e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z james watt c   watt was a scottish inventor and mechanical engineer renowned for his improvements in steam engine technology james watt was born in greenock on  january  his father was a prosperous shipwright watt initially worked as a maker of mathematical instruments but soon became interested in steam engines the first working steam engine had been patented in  and by the time of watts birth newcomen engines were pumping water from mines all over the country in around  watt was given a model newcomen engine to repair he realised that it was hopelessly inefficient and began to work to improve the design he designed a separate condensing chamber for the steam engine that prevented enormous losses of steam his first patent in  covered this device and other improvements on newcomens engine watts partner and backer was the inventor john roebuck in  roebucks interest was taken over by matthew boulton who owned an engineering works in birmingham together he and watt began to manufacture steam engines boulton  watt became the most important engineering firm in the country meeting considerable demand initially this came from cornish mine owners but extended to paper flour cotton and iron mills as well as distilleries canals and waterworks in  watt and boulton were elected fellows of the royal society by  watt was a wealthy man and in  he retired and devoted himself entirely to research work he patented several other important inventions including the rotary engine the doubleaction engine and the steam indicator which records the steam pressure inside the engine watt died on  august  a unit of measurement of electrical and mechanical power  the watt  is named in his honour a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u

frse  january   january  os –  august  was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he developed the concept of horsepower and the si unit of power the watt was named after him contents  biography  watt and the kettle  early experiments with

external links biography bust of watt in the scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys

was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the

 august and being buried on  september the date  august originates from the biography the life of james watt  p  by james patrick muirhead it draws its supposed legitimacy from the fact that muirhead was a nephew of watt and therefore should have been wellinformed in the muirhead papers  august date is mentioned elsewhere the latter date is also given in contemporary newspaper reports for example

was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the

featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the

indicator diagram with john southern influences thomas newcomen joseph black adam smith john robison physicist john roebuck james keir signature james watt frs frse  january   january  os –  august  was a scottish inventor mechanical engineer and chemist who improved on thomas newcomens  newcomen steam engine with his watt steam engine in  which was fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both his native great britain and the rest of the world while working as an instrument maker at the university of glasgow watt became interested in the technology of steam engines he realized that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder watt introduced a design enhancement the separate condenser which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power efficiency and costeffectiveness of steam engines eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water watt attempted to commercialize his invention but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with matthew boulton in  the new firm of boulton and watt was eventually highly successful and watt became a wealthy man in his retirement watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work he died in  aged  he

scottish national portrait gallery james watt was born on  january  in greenock renfrewshire a seaport on the firth of clyde his father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother agnes muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated both were presbyterians and strong covenanters watts grandfather thomas watt was a mathematics teacher and baillie to the baron of cartsburn despite being raised by religious parents he later on became a deist watt did not attend school regularly initially he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended greenock grammar school he exhibited great manual dexterity engineering skills and an aptitude for mathematics while latin and greek failed to interest him when he was eighteen his mother died and his fathers health began to fail watt travelled to london to study instrumentmaking for a year then returned to scotland settling in the major commercial city of glasgow intent on setting up his own instrumentmaking business he made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants parallel rulers scales parts for telescopes and barometers among other things because he had not served at least seven years as an apprentice the glasgow guild of hammermen which had jurisdiction over any artisans using hammers blocked his application despite there being no other mathematical instrument makers in scotland watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by alexander macfarlane to the university of glasgow instruments that required expert attention watt restored them to working order and was remunerated these instruments were eventually installed in the macfarlane observatory subsequently three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university it was initiated in  and two of the professors the physicist and chemist joseph black as well as the famed adam smith became watts friends at first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university helping with demonstrations and expanding the production of quadrants in  he formed a partnership with john craig an architect and businessman to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys this partnership lasted for the next six years and employed up to sixteen workers craig died in  one employee alex gardner eventually took over the business which lasted into the twentieth century in  watt married his cousin margaret peggy miller with whom he had five children two of whom lived to adulthood james jr – and margaret – his wife died in childbirth in  in  he was married again to ann macgregor daughter of a glasgow dyemaker with whom he had two children gregory – who became a geologist and mineralogist and janet – ann died in  between  and  he lived in regent place birmingham watt and the kettle there is a popular story that watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing watt the power of steam this story is told in many forms in some watt is a young lad in others he is older sometimes its his mothers kettle sometimes his aunts james watt of course did not actually invent the steam engine as the story implies but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser this is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency it appears that the story of watt and the kettle was created possibly by watts son james watt jr and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember in this light it can be seen as akin to the story of isaac newton the falling apple and his discovery of gravity although it is often dismissed as a myth like most good stories the story of james watt and the kettle has a basis in fact in trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam james watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam early experiments with steam james eckford lauder james watt and the steam engine the dawn of the nineteenth century  original condenser by watt science museum in  watts friend john robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power the design of the newcomen engine in use for almost  years for pumping water from mines had hardly changed from its first implementation watt began to experiment with steam though he had never seen an operating steam engine he tried constructing a model it failed to work satisfactorily but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject he came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constanttemperature process—in understanding the engine which unknown to watt his friend joseph black had previously discovered some years before understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another  years in  watt was asked to repair a model newcomen engine belonging to the university even after repair the engine barely worked after much experimentation watt demonstrated that about threequarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle this energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy watts critical insight arrived at in may  was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a steam jacket thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle making more available to perform useful work watt had a working model later that same year the ruin of watts cottage workshop at kinneil house cylinder fragment of watts first operational engine at the carron works falkirk despite a potentially workable design there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a fullscale engine this required more capital some of which came from black more substantial backing came from john roebuck the founder of the celebrated carron iron works near falkirk with whom he now formed a partnership roebuck lived at kinneil house in boness during which time watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house the shell of the cottage and a very large part of one of his projects still exist to the rear the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on watts invention strapped for resources watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor then as a civil engineer—for eight years roebuck went bankrupt and matthew boulton who owned the soho manufactory works near birmingham acquired his patent rights an extension of the patent to  was successfully obtained in  through boulton watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world the difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by john wilkinson who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at bersham near wrexham north wales watt and boulton formed a hugely successful partnership boulton and watt which lasted for the next twentyfive years first engines engraving of a  steam engine designed by boulton and watt main article watt steam engine main article watts linkage main article watts curve in  the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises these first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft the design was commercially successful and for the next five years watt was very busy installing more engines mostly in cornwall for pumping water out of mines these early engines were not manufactured by boulton and watt but were made by others according to drawings made by watt who served in the role of consulting engineer the erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by watt at first and then by men in the firms employ these were large machines the first for example had a cylinder with a diameter of some  inches and an overall height of about  feet and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it boulton and watt charged an annual payment equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a newcomen engine performing the same work the field of application for the invention was greatly widened when boulton urged watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding weaving and milling although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion watt and boulton were stymied by a patent for this whose holder james pickard and associates proposed to crosslicense the external condenser watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in  over the next six years he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine a double acting engine in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one he described methods for working the steam expansively ie using steam at pressures well above atmospheric a compound engine which connected two or more engines was described two more patents were granted for these in  and  numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented one of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume which he kept as a trade secret another important invention one which watt was most proud of was the parallel motion which was essential in doubleacting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump from the connected rocking beam whose end moves in a circular arc this was patented in  a throttle valve to control the power of the engine and a centrifugal governor patented in  to keep it from running away were very important these improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the newcomen engine because of the danger of exploding boilers which were in a very primitive stage of development and the ongoing issues with leaks watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure patent trials a steam engine built to james watts patent in  at freiberg in germany edward bull started constructing engines for boulton and watt in cornwall in  by  he had started making engines of his own design but which contained a separate condenser and so infringed watts patents two brothers jabez carter hornblower and jonathan hornblower jnr also started to build engines about the same time others began to modify newcomen engines by adding a condenser and the mine owners in cornwall became convinced that watts patent could not be enforced they started to withhold payments due to boulton and watt which by  had fallen of the total £ equivalent to £ as of  owed only £ had been received watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims he first sued bull in  the jury found for watt but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial in the meantime injunctions were issued against the infringers forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow the trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers except for jonathan hornblower all began to settle their cases hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges in  was decisively in favour of watt their friend john wilkinson who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder was a particularly grievous case he had erected about twenty engines without boultons and watts knowledge they finally agreed to settle the infringement in  boulton and watt never collected all that was owed them but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration these trials were extremely costly in both money and time but ultimately were successful for the firm copying machine before  there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings the only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens watt at first experimented with improving this method but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome he instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet moistened with a solvent and pressed to the original the second sheet had to be thin so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light thus reproducing the original exactly watt started to develop the process in  and made many experiments to formulate the ink select the thin paper to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer all of these required much experimentation but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later watt formed another partnership with boulton who provided financing and james keir to manage the business in a firm called james watt and co the perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others but this was carried out over the next few years boulton and watt gave up their shares to their sons in  it became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century chemical experiments from an early age watt was very interested in chemistry in late  while in paris he witnessed an experiment by berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine he had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles and had published his findings which aroused great interest among many potential rivals when watt returned to britain he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process he discovered that a mixture of salt manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine which watt believed might be a cheaper method he passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties he soon communicated these results to james mcgrigor his fatherinlaw who was a bleacher in glasgow otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret with mcgrigor and his wife annie he started to scale up the process and in march  mcgrigor was able to bleach  yards of cloth to his satisfaction about this time berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process and published it so it became public knowledge many others began to experiment with improving the process which still had many shortcomings not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product watts rivals soon overtook him in developing the process and he dropped out of the race it was not until  when charles tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite that it became a commercial success by  watt had been chosen by thomas beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce clean and store gases for use in the new pneumatic institution at hotwells in bristol watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years but by  the medical uses for the factitious airs had come to a dead end scientific apparatus designed by boulton and watt in preparation of the pneumatic institution in bristol personality watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically humphry davy said of him those who consider james watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences and that peculiar characteristic of genius the union of them for practical application he was greatly respected by other prominent men of the industrial revolution he was an important member of the lunar society and was a much soughtafter conversationalist and companion always interested in expanding his horizons his personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and longlasting watt was a prolific correspondent during his years in cornwall he wrote long letters to boulton several times per week he was averse to publishing his results in for example the philosophical transactions of the royal society however and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents he was an excellent draughtsman james watts letters from the science museum library  archives in wroughton he was a rather poor businessman and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine in a letter to william small in  watt confessed that he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain until he retired he was always much concerned about his financial affairs and was something of a worrier his health was often poor he was subject to frequent nervous headaches and depression soho foundry at first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property they produced almost none of the parts themselves watt did most of his work at his home in harpers hill in birmingham while boulton worked at the soho manufactory gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts and by  they purchased a property about a mile away from the soho manufactory on the banks of the birmingham canal to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines the soho foundry formally opened in  at a time when watts sons gregory and james jr were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise in  the year of watts retirement the firm made a total of fortyone engines later years an  painting of heathfield watts house in handsworth by allen edward everitt james watts workshop watt retired in  the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with boulton expired the famous partnership was transferred to the mens sons matthew robinson boulton and james watt jr  longtime firm engineer william murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered watt continued to invent other things before and during his semiretirement within his home in handsworth staffordshire watt made use of a garret room as a workshop and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions among other things he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well but which he never patented one of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend adam smith he maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects he proposed for example a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the clyde at glasgow he and his second wife travelled to france and germany and he purchased an estate in midwales at doldowlod house one mile south of llanwrthwl which he much improved in  he took a trip on the paddlesteamer comet a product of his inventions to revisit his home town of greenock he died on  august  at his home heathfield in handsworth staffordshire now part of birmingham at the age of  he was buried on  september in the graveyard of st marys church handsworth the church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church murdochs contributions william murdoch joined boulton and watt in  at first he worked in the pattern shop in soho but soon he was erecting engines in cornwall he became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success a very able man he made several important inventions on his own john griffiths who wrote a biography of him in  has argued that watts discouraging murdoch from working with high pressure steam watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in  and a steam locomotive in  both of which have strong claims to have been invented by murdoch the patent was never contested by murdoch however and boulton and watts firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines even long after the patent for the crank expired in  murdoch was made a partner of the firm in  where he remained until his retirement  years later at the age of  legacy a preserved watt beam engine at loughborough university main article industrial revolution james watts improvements to the steam engine converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the industrial revolution the availability of efficient reliable motive power made whole new classes of industry economically viable and altered the economies of continents in doing so it brought about immense social change attracting millions of rural families to the towns and cities of watt the english novelist aldous huxley – wrote to us the moment  am means something – something very important if it happens to be the starting time of our daily train to our ancestors such an odd eccentric instant was without significance – did not even exist in inventing the locomotive watt and stephenson were part inventors of time honours watt was much honoured in his own time in  he was made a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh and was elected as a member of the batavian society for experimental philosophy of rotterdam in  in  he was elected to the elite group the smeatonian society of civil engineers in  he was conferred the honorary doctor of laws by the university of glasgow the french academy elected him a corresponding member and he was made a foreign associate in  the watt is named after james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine and was adopted by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in  and by the th general conference on weights and measures in  as the unit of power incorporated in the international system of units or si on  may  the bank of england announced that boulton and watt would appear on a new £ note the design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a bank of england note and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of watts steam engine and boultons soho manufactory quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note i sell here sir what all the world desires to have—power boulton and i can think of nothing else but this machine watt the inclusion of watt is the second time that a scot has featured on a bank of england note the first was adam smith on the  issue £ note in september  it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on  november in  he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the scottish engineering hall of fame memorials the james watt memorial college in greenock watt was buried in the grounds of st marys church handsworth in birmingham later expansion of the church over his grave means that his tomb is now buried inside the church the garret room workshop that watt used in his retirement was left locked and untouched until  when it was first viewed by his biographer j p muirhead thereafter it was occasionally visited but left untouched as a kind of shrine a proposal to have it transferred to the patent office came to nothing when the house was due to be demolished in  the room and all its contents were presented to the science museum where it was recreated in its entirety it remained on display for visitors for many years but was walledoff when the gallery it was housed in closed the workshop remained intact and preserved and in march  was put on public display as part of a new permanent science museum exhibition james watt and our world the approximate location of james watts birth in greenock is commemorated by a statue several locations and street names in greenock recall him most notably the watt memorial library which was begun in  with watts donation of scientific books and developed as part of the watt institution by his son which ultimately became the james watt college taken over by the local authority in  the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of inverclyde and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in george square glasgow and princes street edinburgh as well as several others in birmingham where he is also remembered by the moonstones and a school is named in his honour the james watt college has expanded from its original location to include campuses in kilwinning north ayrshire finnart street and the waterfront in greenock and the sports campus in largs heriotwatt university near edinburgh was at one time the school of arts of edinburgh founded in  as the worlds first mechanics institute but to commemorate george heriot the thcentury financier to king james and james watt after royal charter the name was changed to heriotwatt university dozens of university and college buildings chiefly of science and technology are named after him matthew boultons home soho house is now a museum commemorating the work of both men the university of glasgows faculty of engineering has its headquarters in the james watt building which also houses the department of mechanical engineering and the department of aerospace engineering the huge painting james watt contemplating the steam engine by james eckford lauder is now owned by the national gallery of scotland chantreys statue of james watt there is a statue of james watt in piccadilly gardens manchester and city square leeds a colossal statue of watt by chantrey was placed in westminster abbey and later was moved to st pauls cathedral on the cenotaph the inscription reads in part james watt  enlarged the resources of his country increased the power of man and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the real benefactors of the world a bust of watt is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling patents watt was the sole inventor listed on his six patents patent  a method of

 august and being buried on  september the date  august originates from the biography the life of james watt  p  by james patrick muirhead it draws its supposed legitimacy from the fact that muirhead was a nephew of watt and therefore should have been wellinformed in the muirhead papers  august date is mentioned elsewhere the latter date is also given in contemporary newspaper reports for example

watt biography  parents school mother son information born time year achievements world biography tuwe james watt biography james watt biography born january   greenock scotland died august   heathfield england scottish engineer instrument maker and inventor the british instrument maker and engineer james watt developed an efficient steam engine that was a universal covering everything source of power and thereby provided one of the most essential technological parts of the early industrial revolution a period of rapid economic growth that involved increased reliance on machines and large factories watts early years james watt was born on january   in greenock scotland the son of a shipwright a carpenter who builds and fixes ships and merchant of ships goods as a child james suffered from ill health he attended an elementary school where he learned some geometry as well as latin and greek but he was not well enough to attend regularly for the most part he was educated by his parents at home his father taught him writing and arithmetic and his mother taught him reading of much more interest to james was his fathers store where the boy had his own tools and forge furnace to shape metals and where he skillfully made models of the ships gear that surrounded him his father taught him how to craft things from wood and metal he also taught james the skill of instrument making as a youngster he played with a small carpentry set his father gave him taking his toys apart putting them back together and making new ones in  watt was apprenticed working for someone to learn a craft to a london england mathematical instrument maker at that time the trade primarily produced navigational ship steering and surveying land measuring instruments watt found london to be unpleasant however a year later he returned to scotland watt wanted to establish himself in glasgow scotland as an instrument maker however restrictions imposed by the tradesmens guilds associations of craftsmen stood in his way friends at the university of glasgow eventually arranged for him to be appointed as mathematical instrument maker to the university in late  about this time watt met joseph black who had already laid the foundation base of modern chemistry and of the study of heat their friendship was of some importance in the early development of the steam engine invention of the steam engine at the university of glasgow watt had become engaged in his first studies on the steam engine during the winter of – he was asked to repair the universitys model of an earlier model of the steam engine made by thomas newcomen around the year  after a few experiments watt recognized that the fault with the model rested not so much in the details of its construction as in its design he found that a volume amount of space taken up by an object or substance of steam three or four times the volume of the piston cylinder chamber with a moving object inside of it was required to make the piston move to the end of the cylinder the solution watt provided was to keep the piston at the temperature of the steam by means of a jacket heated by steam and to condense make less dense the steam in a james watt courtesy of the library of congress  separate vessel chamber rather than in the piston such a separate condenser avoided the large heat losses that resulted from repeatedly heating and cooling the body of the piston and so engine efficiency was improved it took time for watt to turn a good idea for a commercial invention into reality a decade passed before watt solved all the mechanical problems black lent him money and introduced him to john roebuck of the carron ironworks in scotland in  roebuck and watt entered into a partnership watt still had to earn his own living but his employment as surveyor of canal construction left little time for developing his invention however watt did manage to prepare a patent application on his invention and the patent was granted on january   by  roebucks financial difficulties brought not only watts work on the engine to a standstill but also roebucks own business matthew boulton an industrialist someone who owns and operates a factory of birmingham england then became watts partner watt moved to birmingham he was now able to work full time on his invention in  boulton accepted two orders to build watts steam engine the two engines were set up in  and their success led to many other orders improvements in the steam engine between  and  watt modified and further improved his engine these changes combined to make as great an advance over his original engine as the latter was over the newcomen engine the most important modifications were a more efficient use of the steam the use of a doubleacting piston the replacement of the flexible chain connection to the beam by the rigid three bar linkage the provision of another mechanical device to change the reciprocating back and forth motion of the beam end to a rotary circular motion and the provision of a device to regulate the speed having devised a new rotary machine the partners had next to determine the cost of constructing it these rotary steam engines replaced animal power and it was only natural that the new engine should be measured in terms of the number of horses it replaced by using measurements that millwrights people who build mills who set up horse gins animaldriven wheels had determined watt found the value of one horse power to be equal to thirtythree thousand pounds lifted one foot high per minute this value is still used as the standard for american and english horsepower the charge of building the new type of steam engine was based upon its horsepower from that time forward other inventions on watts many business trips there was always a good deal of correspondence letters that had to be copied to avoid this tiresome task he devised letterpress copying this works by writing the original document with a special ink copies are then made by simply placing another sheet of paper on the freshly written sheet and then pressing the two together watts interests in applied practical chemistry led him to introduce chlorine bleaching into great britain and to devise a famous iron cement in theoretical chemistry he was one of the first to argue that water was not an element basic substance of matter made up of only one kind of atom but a compound substance made up of two or more elements in  watt and boulton turned over their flourishing business to their sons watt maintained a workshop where he continued his inventing activities until he died on august   watts achievements in perfecting the steam engine have been recognized worldwide the watt a unit of electrical power was named
