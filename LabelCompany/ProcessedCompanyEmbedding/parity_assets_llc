loading the player what is parity parity refers to two things being equal to each other the term par value for a bond is similar to parity parity can also refer to two securities having equal value such as a convertible bond and the value of the stock if the bondholder chooses to convert into common stock in an exchange market parity occurs when all brokers bidding for the same security have equal standing due to identical bids when parity occurs the market must determine which bidding broker will obtain the security by alternative means therefore the winning bid is typically awarded by random draw in foreign exchange markets currencies are at parity when the exchange rate relationship is exactly one to one breaking down parity many investors have to make decisions about the value of two different investments a convertible bond for example allows the investor to own a bond and earn a stated rate of interest or convert the bond into a fixed number of shares of common stock assume for example that an investor can own a  corporate bond with a market price of  or convert the bond into  shares of common stock if the stock’s market price is  the market value of the  shares of stock is also  as a result the bond and the stock are at parity factoring in options the term parity also applies to stock options one call option for example allows the owner to buy  shares of stock at a specific price strike price for a stated period of time assume that an investor owns a  call option that expires on september  the investor has the right to buy  shares of stock at  per share until the expiration date in september the intrinsic value of an option is the difference between the strike price and the market price of the stock if the stocks market price is  per share for example the options intrinsic value is  per share if the market price of the call option is also  per share the option is trading at parity how currency trading defines parity companies based in the united states that have operations in foreign countries must convert us dollars into other currencies if a us firm does business in france for example the company can convert us dollars into euros and sends those euros to fund its french business operations if the exchange rate is  to € the currencies are at parity examples of parity in asset management risk parity is an asset management process that evaluates risk based on asset classes rather than allocation of capital tradition asset allocation strategy divides assets between stocks bonds and cash the goal is to provide diversify and reduce risk by using these the types of investments risk parity on the other hand allocates dollars based on four components equities credit interest rates and commodities risk parity attempts to reduce risk and increase

coming soon fundamental investing coming soon financial modeling all courses site log in advisor insights log in newsletters risk parity share loading the player what is risk parity risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy based on targeting risk levels across the various components of an investment portfolio the risk parity approach to asset allocation allows investors to target specific levels of risk and to divide that risk equally across the entire investment portfolio in order to achieve optimal portfolio diversification for each individual investor risk parity strategies are in contrast to traditional allocation methods that are based on holding a certain percentage of investment classes such as  stocks and  bonds within ones investment portfolio breaking down risk parity the risk parity approach to portfolio asset allocation focuses on the amount of risk in each component rather than the specific dollar amounts invested in each component in other words risk parity focuses not on the allocation of capital like traditional allocation models but on the allocation of risk risk parity considers four different components equities credit interest rates and commodities and attempts to spread risk evenly across the asset classes the goal of risk parity investing is to earn the same level of return with less volatility and risk or to realize better returns with an equal amount of risk and volatility versus traditional asset allocation strategies a traditional  portfolio can attribute  to  of its risk allocation to equities as a result the portfolios returns will be dependent upon the returns of the equity markets proponents of the risk parity strategy state that while the  approach performs well during bull markets and periods of economic growth it tends to fail during bear markets and economic slumps the risk parity approach attempts to balance the portfolio to perform well under a variety of economic and market conditions several risk parityspecific products including mutual funds are available and investors can also build their own risk parity portfolios through careful research or by working with a qualified financial professional the first

online to speak at consensus  register now shapeshift breaks new ground with prism digital asset portfolio product may   at  utc by pete rizzo features  •  use cases  verticals  •  ethereum  •  business news  •  technology news  •  startups amid a booming market for cryptocurrencies swiss startup shapeshift is launching a new kind of exchange that specializes in the sale of synthetic ethereum assets in short its newest product prism available today in closed beta is less of an exchange and more a new way to trade cryptocurrencies enabling users to create custom prisms by putting ether into a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain that is designed to mimic the price fluctuations of any of the hundreds of available cryptographic assets traded on exchanges and thats where shapeshift ceo erik voorhees believes the companys second product could come to solve problems for traders and investors voorhees told coindesk if you want to get  different coins today you have two ways of doing it what most people do they make an account at the exchange they make an account at the exchange and they just leave them there it causes a huge counterparty risk still voorhees cautioned that prism isnt meant to be all things to all people but rather just a product for the growing number of more casual cryptocurrency users who want to gain exposure to certain assets without the risk created when dealing with exchanges and thats a valid concern in an industry where exchanges have proven susceptible to hacks fraud and issues with banking providers that have impaired their operations and cost users money with prism the user experience changes instead of buying a cryptocurrency and keeping those funds on an exchange or holding the keys in an offline wallet users put a dollar amount invest it in bitcoin ether and monero and select the exposure they would like the portfolio to have relative to the price fluctuations of each asset in this case there is no bitcoin or monero only ether in a smart contract that changes its value based on data fed to an oracle that receives its prices from traditional exchanges now that the prism has been created the investor can watch the current value of their portfolio which will rise and fall with the value of the underlying assets the company stated theres also a social component with the most successful prisms showing up on a leaderboard of where these custom assets are ranked people can see the prism you made and they can clone it and make their own portfolio voorhees said in this way the product is the latest that seeks to capitalize in the runup of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies which exceeded bn for the first time this year reaching a new alltime high last week the basics users create prisms by first putting up a certain amount of collateral denominated in ether into a smart contract behind the scenes a smart contract operated by shapeshift deploys a smart contract that represents the portfolio users then fund the address they provide and for which they responsible for maintaining keeping the custody of the assets underlying the portfolio finally users send funds to the address thereby creating a contract the result is that the portfolio doesnt even hold ether assets but rather it tracks contract terms which are set up to change to track the value of all the assets a prism portfolio doesnt have a bunch of proxy tokens sitting somewhere it is simply ethereum as collateral put into the contract by the buyer and ether put into the contract from the seller and the price can rise and fall he continued the backend still to create the prism another user needs to take the other side of the trade that sets up the account effectively betting against each investment in the portfolio future versions of the product voorhees said may enable users to enter into such agreements with other users but to start shapeshift will be the counterparty to every transaction hedging its trades in the background to ensure the integrity of its finances the simplest explanation is you make a prism of  bitcoin thats the whole prism its worth  bitcoin shapeshift takes the other side of that so that means shapeshift is short  bitcoin shapeshift just buys a bitcoin from someone then if bitcoin goes up it lost  on the prism but gained  on bitcoin so its a wash he explained in this way shapeshift will make its money on closing costs associated with the accounts users will be charged a  fee to close out prisms plus  eth about  today a fee that covers the gas cost the shapeshift must pay to run the smart contracts on the public ethereum blockchain as the prisms are fully with ether capital theres also a  per month fee paid to cover that cost of capital iterative drive the product launch also marks an evolution for shapeshift originally founded in  as an advancement over traditional orderbook exchanges instead of trading users of the original shapeshift project swap between cryptocurrencies a process that occurs without the need for account creation or management reducing trust in the service and as long argued by voorhees creating a value proposition in line with the spirit of decentralized economic networks still voorhees appears to already be thinking ahead to the next step in conversation he mentions how the technology exists for users to take their prism and issue tokens on the ethereum blockchain representing shares in that prism theres no block on someone doing that he said voorhees has even gone so far as to conceptualize a time when regulated firms may even use a whitelabel version of the service or a similar type of technology for the more traditional financial assets that are wellknown by wall street when broaching the subject i even float the idea speculating it could as far as  years into the future should the technology mature sufficiently voorhees concluded well more like in five years but i dont want to get into that too much disclosure coindesk is a subsidiary of digital currency group which has an ownership stake in shapeshift  images via shapeshift the leader in blockchain

september  read time  min download a traditional asset allocation framework allocates to various asset classes with the goal of matching important risk exposures in reality many asset classes share exposures to common risk factors and thus are highly correlated particularly with equities this article explains how investors can achieve more intuitive and perhaps more sensible portfolios with an approach based on risk factors the traditional asset allocation framework unsurprisingly starts with assets it is a tradition based on convenience and perhaps an implicit assumption that key asset classes match well to the important risk exposures the more modern asset allocation and analytic framework anchors instead on “risks”  while the two frameworks may lead to similar outcomes the riskbased approach can often offer greater simplicity and allow for more natural asset allocation intuition in this article i explain the benefits of the riskbased approach relative to the assetbased approach additionally i introduce simplifying analogies which facilitate building intuition on the differences between the two approaches toward the end of the article i also offer three applications of the riskbased framework to demonstrate investment issues which otherwise would not be apparent in an assetbased analytical framework however a complete description on how to implement a riskbased approach is outside of the scope of this article  asset classes vs risk exposures in the assetbased framework the allocation process involves assigning weights to the various asset classes available to the investor eg equities bonds commodities real estate etc asset classes are captured by their corresponding market indexes each specific major asset category is split across finer asset classes such as us international and emerging markets for equities and us treasuries sovereigns and corporates for bonds in this framework assets are investment vehicles for “owning” risk exposures so the “assetbased” approach is essentially an “investment productbased” approach the more modern analytical framework is a riskbased approach which makes a strong distinction between investment vehicles and risk exposures in this framework the allocation process involves assigning weights to a set of risk exposures rather than assets the allocation process first determines the “risks” that an investor wants to hold taking into account how the risks interact with each other and the premia they generate then the investor can construct his preferred combination of “assets” to achieve his desired risk exposures taking into account the valuation levels attached to assets typically the investor will have a preference for using “attractively priced” assets to access the desired risk exposure the standard criticism of the traditional assetbased approach is that it leads to portfolios that are dominated by equitylike risk even though portfolios appear to be well diversified this occurs in part because very different assets can often contain significant exposure to equitylike risk generally most researchers agree that there are a few primary economic risk exposures shocks to economic growth shocks to inflation and shocks to credit availability among others many assets if not most contain multiple risk exposures for example corporate bonds are exposed to all three of the above risks similarly high yielding stocks can also have significant exposure to all three risks therefore adding high yield bonds to a portfolio of high yielding stocks wouldn’t necessarily improve the portfolio’s risk diversification despite the increase in asset class diversification nutrients are to foods as risks are to assets the riskbased approach with its associated technical jargon such as “risk factor loadings” can seem unintuitive to many investors i find the following food analogy to be very effective at illustrating the riskbased framework it is often convenient to think of risks as nutrients assets as foods and portfolios as meals people need to consume a mix of nutrients which vary by individual circumstances because nutrients come bundled in various foods—dairy grains meats for example—people must combine foods to create a meal that supplies them with the desired nutrition however it is likely that many different meals would provide comparable nutrition thus personal taste and food prices often dictate the preferred meal in asset allocation language individual asset classes contain different risk exposures a desired combination of risks can be achieved with different asset allocation portfolios ultimately prices costs and investment governance will dictate the preferred portfolio the food analogy is also helpful for understanding tactical asset allocation taa for example when food prices change we can choose to consume the same nutrients at a lower cost by eating a different meal consisting of different food ingredients in the risk framework taa can be understood as tactically rebalancing toward outoffavor assets that provide “cheaper” access to a set of underlying economic risks and away from the “expensive” assets offering the same risk exposures applications of the riskbased framework we illustrate the riskbased framework with the following three applications these applications are meant to illustrate investment insights which would not be available through the traditional assetbased analysis application  rethinking “rebalancing and the strategic portfolio weights” in the assetbased framework the stocks proxied by the sp  index and bonds proxied by the barcap agg index are viewed as fundamental portfolio building blocks us investors generally hold large and often static strategic allocations tied to the two benchmarks with a  equity bond strategic allocation as the traditional “norm” it is dangerous however to assume that the sp  or the barcap agg are assets with static risk exposures over time in  technology stocks comprised  of the sp  the index had a pe ratio of  and a dividend yield of  in  technology stocks became  of the sp  pushing the index volatility from its historical average of  to  the pe ratio to  and the dividend yield to  similarly in  the barcap agg had a  year duration while yielding  today the barcap agg has duration risk of  years while yield fell to an abysmal  clearly a disciplined rebalance back toward the  allocation over this period would have produced a portfolio with wildly fluctuating underlying risk exposures using the food analogy again it is instructive to think of the barcap agg as a hamburger as america demanded more “manly” beef patties fast food restaurants moved to double patties often with bacon to boot the proteins not to mention the calories and fat of today’s gourmet burgers are significantly higher than the burgers of the past  calories for an average burger  years ago vs  calories today given the agg’s significant increase in duration risk not to mention the lower yield—is it wise to still insist on a hamburger combo meal in fact would it not be better to change our meal completely and source our proteins and calories from cheaper ingredients application  interpreting hedge fund performances from the assetbased framework hedge funds are particularly difficult to examine many hedge funds trade exotic and illiquid assets the hedge funds which hold conventional securities would often apply complex strategies involving leverage and shorting the complexity has sometimes led investors to treat hedge funds as a separate asset class to which the cynics retort that the only shared characteristics for entrees in the asset class are opacity and high fees much of the blackbox complexity can be unraveled in the riskbased space providing some useful insights into hedge fund strategies it turns out that many hedge fund strategies can be mimicked using more liquid and traditional assets this is because many hedge funds despite their exotic holdings and strategies actually probably unintentionally end up owning fairly commonplace risk exposures further for the average funds there is often little evidence that accessing standard risks through more exotic assets or using complex trading strategies has led to superior returns  to be fair some hedge funds may provide exotic risk exposures that are not found in conventional assets or strategies for example earning returns from exposures to extreme economic shocks by writing options is an innovation that expands the investment frontier using our nutrient analogy hedge fund providers argue that their products provide exclusive nutritional compounds in the form of “alphas” and rare nutrients in the form of “exotic betas” hardtoget nutrients and exclusive health compounds are necessarily expensive we now know that the average hedge fund actually provides nutrients that can be found readily in standard assets only a small fraction of hedge funds truly provide the hardtoget “exotic betas” and even fewer provide proprietary “alpha” in this context most hedge funds are more like foofoo health foods such as bird nest and shark fin which at hundreds to thousands of dollars per pound are advertised to combat aging and cancer but actually contain nothing more than garden variety vitamins and proteins application  risk parity risk parity is an asset allocation portfolio heuristic that attempts to provide a diversified portfolio of risk exposures specifically it seeks to overcome the heavy dependence on equities in the conventional  allocation portfolio the implementation of the concept is often in the “asset” space this means there would be parity in the assets’ contribution to the overall portfolio volatility but no parity in the underlying economic risk exposures the popular and standard risk parity solution is based on volatility weighting of “distinct” asset classes as with a naïve reliance on the  allocation a naïve assetbased approach to risk parity is also suboptimal because asset classes can often appear distinct but actually contain similar risks a seemingly diversified risk parity portfolio constructed from equities commodities high yield credit real estate and bonds is like a mixed grill of beef pork lamb and chicken with a small side salad—ie not a balanced meal nutritionally this risk parity portfolio probably provides no better diversification than a simple  equitybond portfolio conclusion when investors analyze choices in the assetbased framework the large variety of different yet related assets can make the analysis extremely complex naïve investors can often mistake the asset diversity in their portfolios for adequate risk diversification further because assets contain both risks and valuation in the same bundle it would lead to easier analyses if we unbundle the two components the riskbased approach to asset allocation allows us to separate the two leading to more intuitive and perhaps more sensible portfolio solutions despite the technical jargon and the seemingly more abstract framework the riskbased approach has a lot to offer investors—particularly in a world where

refinement of the risk factors into meaningful economic risk exposure see chen roll and ross   note that this “unbundling” of risk and valuation decision allows us to think carefully about what beta risks we are willing to take to earn returns and to examine how diversified our sources of “beta” risks are the valuation question enters next for many investors who believe that assets can be mispriced relative to their risk exposures this offers an opportunity for asset allocation “alpha” through selecting cheaper assets to gain the desired risk exposures  note that the classic pension portfolio structured from the  equitybond construct has  of its total portfolio variance driven by equity risk see bhansali davis hsu li and rennison  for a review of the risk concentration issue commonly found in assetbased asset allocation approaches  the nutrient vs food analogy is not original it has been used previously by professor john cochrane at the university of chicago and professor andrew ang at columbia university  also important is that some assets provide access to a particular risk without introducing other unwanted risks for example chicken breasts provide protein more effectively than ribeye steaks which are both more expensive and contain more arteryclogging saturated fat  barcap agg is the barclays capital aggregate bond index which is one of the most commonly used bond indices  it contains almost all of the us investment grade bonds including treasury agency mortgage and corporate bonds the weights are based on market capitalization of the bond issues  the index is generally dominated by treasury bonds due to the issuance size of us treasuries relative to other bonds  see fung and hsieh ab  aggrawal and naik  ennis and sebastian  and hasanhodzic and lo

yao hua ooi topic risk parity aqr white paper risk parity investing is in our view a reasonable investment strategy which emphasizes diversification over concentration it is not as some critics have said simply “leveraging bonds” we believe there is strong theoretical and empirical backing to suggest that more diversified portfolios like risk parity portfolios can produce superior riskadjusted returns relative to concentrated portfolios over the long term we believe risk parity persistently offers a small edge that can compound to a large advantage over time that edge has held up historically even during long periods of moderately rising interest rates and even if that cumulative rise in rates is substantial to be sure risk parity investing is not a panacea if all asset classes go down a risk parity portfolio will lose money when equities are soaring it may do very well but will likely underperform  equitybond portfolios and other strategies that load up on equity risk when interest rates rise sharply — and more generally when multiple nonequity asset classes perform poorly — risk parity will at times struggle to keep up with equitydominated portfolios however as this paper demonstrates risk parity may outperform strategies dependent on equity risk in the long run even though a prolonged period of rising rates anyone evaluating risk parity should consider a range of scenarios including the equity crash that severely hurts  investors as well as morecommon situations where some asset classes perform reasonably well and others perform not so well in these morecommon scenarios diversification would provide meaningful benefit to a portfolio the views and opinions expressed herein are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of aqr
