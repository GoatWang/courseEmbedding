you like besti loved the simple and clean interface everything about the platform seems intuitive you can literally start a campaign in minutes and begin serving ads immediatelywhat do you dislikethe only thing i really disliked was the inability to directly integrate data from the insights to build an audience to a live campaign  of the time when it worked is was glorious but many of the insights data sets were not directly available to build an audience and required manually searching the catalog for similar matches small dislike but a dislike nonethelessrecommendations to others considering the producti would recommend at least trying a small campaign with choozle so you can introduce yourself to the product it is very simple to use but there are small idiosyncrasies that separate this platform from others in a positive way once you have a handle on them you will be able to be very successful with this platformwhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits

billed ahead of time the only thing i worry about is that it feels a bit like theres a cash management crunch which if you are scaling on this platform might be a little worrisome its just something
