trust and and the stockbrokers that sell wells reit  specifically investors may have recovery options to recoup the losses of almost 0 of their investment  stockbrokers generally do not disclose the risks posed by an investment in wells specifically • no public market currently exists for our shares of common stock and we have no current plans to list our shares on an exchange  if you are able to sell your shares you would likely have to sell them at a substantial discount from their public offering price • the offering price was not established on an independent basis and bears no relationship to the net value of our assets  the offering price is likely to be higher than the amount you would receive per share if we were to liquidate at this time because of the upfront fees that we pay in connection with the issuance of our shares as well as the recent reduction in the demand for real estate as a result of current disruptions in the credit markets and the economic slowdown • if we raise substantial offering proceeds in a short period of time we may not be able to  invest all of the net offering proceeds promptly which may cause our distributions and the longterm returns of our investors to be lower than they otherwise would • we are dependent upon our advisor and our dealer manager to conduct our operations and this offering thus adverse changes in the financial health of our advisor or dealer manager or our relationship with them could cause our operations to suffer • we will pay substantial fees and expenses to our advisor its affiliates and participating brokerdealers which payments increase the risk that you will not earn a profit on your investment • our advisor and its affiliates will face conflicts of interest including significant conflicts created by our advisor’s compensation arrangements with us and other wellssponsored programs and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs if you are a wells investor contact jeff
