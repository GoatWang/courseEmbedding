to formulate quantum mechanics in terms of matrices for that discovery he was awarded the nobel prize for physics for  in  he published his uncertainty principle upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known he also made important contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows the atomic nucleus ferromagnetism cosmic rays and subatomic particles and he was instrumental in planning the first west german nuclear reactor at karlsruhe together with a research reactor in munich in  considerable controversy surrounds his work on atomic research during world war iieducationheisenberg’s father august heisenberg a scholar of ancient greek philology and modern greek literature was a teacher at a gymnasium classicalhumanistic secondary school and lecturer at the university of würzburg werner’s mother née anna wecklein was the daughter of the rector of the elite maximiliansgymnasium in munich in  august heisenberg became a professor of greek philology at the university of munich werner entered the maximiliansgymnasium the following year and soon impressed his teachers with his precocity in mathematics heisenberg entered the university of munich in  becoming a student of arnold sommerfeld an expert on atomic spectroscopy and exponent of the quantum model of physics the idea that certain properties in atomic physics are not continuous and take on only certain discrete or quantized values at small scales had been developed by danish physicist niels bohr in  heisenberg finished his formal work for a doctorate in  with a dissertation on hydrodynamicsdespite a mediocre dissertation defense heisenberg’s real talents emerged in his work on the anomalous zeeman effect in which atomic spectral lines are split into multiple components under the influence of a magnetic field heisenberg developed a model that accounted for this phenomenon though at the cost of introducing halfinteger quantum numbers a notion at odds with bohr’s theory as understood to date while still officially sommerfeld’s student in  heisenberg became an assistant and student of max born at the university of göttingen where heisenberg also first met bohr

actually work in  after an extended visit to bohr’s institute of theoretical physics at the university of copenhagen heisenberg tackled the problem of spectrum intensities of the electron taken as an anharmonic oscillator a onedimensional vibrating system his position that the theory should be based only on observable quantities was central to his paper of july  “über quantentheoretische umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer beziehungen” “quantumtheoretical reinterpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations” heisenberg’s formalism rested upon noncommutative multiplication born together with his new assistant pascual jordan realized that this could be expressed using matrix algebra which they used in a paper submitted for publication in september as “zur quantenmechanik” “on quantum mechanics” by november born heisenberg and jordan had completed “zur quantenmechanik ii” “on quantum mechanics ii” colloquially known as the “threeman paper” which is regarded as the foundational document of a new quantum mechanicsuncertainty principleother formulations of quantum mechanics were being devised during the s the bracket notation using vectors in a hilbert space was developed by pam dirac in england and the wave equation was worked out by erwin schrödinger in switzerland where the austrian physicist was then working schrödinger soon demonstrated that the different formulations were mathematically equivalent though the physical significance of this equivalence remained unclear heisenberg again returned to bohr’s institute in copenhagen and their conversations on this topic culminated in heisenberg’s landmark paper of march  “über den anschulichen inhalt der quantentheoretischen kinematik und mechanik” “on the perceptual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics” test your knowledge manmade birds in the sky this paper articulated the uncertainty or indeterminacy principle quantum mechanics demonstrated according to heisenberg that the momentum p and position x of a particle could not both be exactly measured simultaneously instead a relation exists between the indeterminacies δ in the measurement of these variables such that δpδx ≥ hπ where h is planck’s constant or  × − joule∙second since there exists a lower limit hπ on the product of the uncertainties if the uncertainty in one variable diminishes toward  the uncertainty in the other must increase reciprocally an analogous relation exists between any pair of canonically conjugate variables such as energy and time britannica lists  quizzes philosophy  religion quiz philosophy  history list  strange disasters pop culture quiz the muppets history list of walls and politics  famous border walls heisenberg drew a philosophically profound conclusion absolute causal determinism was impossible since it required exact knowledge of both position and momentum as initial conditions therefore the use of probabilistic formulations in atomic theory resulted not from ignorance but from the necessarily indeterministic relationship between the variables this viewpoint was central to the socalled “copenhagen interpretation” of quantum theory which got its name from the strong defense for the idea at bohr’s institute in copenhagen although this became a predominant viewpoint several leading physicists including schrödinger and albert einstein saw the renunciation of deterministic causality as physically incompletenobel prizein  heisenberg took up a professorship in leipzig in exchange with dirac jordan wolfgang pauli and others he embarked on a research program to create a quantum field theory uniting quantum mechanics with relativity theory to comprehend the interaction of particles and force fields heisenberg also worked on the theory of the atomic nucleus following the discovery of the neutron in  developing a model of proton and neutron interaction in an early description of what decades later came to be known as the strong force the  nobel prize for physics was not announced until november  when the  winners were also announced heisenberg was awarded the  physics prize while schrödinger and dirac shared the  physics prizeheisenberg and the nazi partythe same year that heisenberg was awarded a nobel prize  also saw the rise to power of the national socialist german workers’ party nazi party nazi policies excluding “nonaryans” or the politically “unreliable” from the civil service meant the dismissal or resignation of many professors and academics—including for example born einstein and schrödinger and several of heisenberg’s students and colleagues in leipzig heisenberg’s response was mostly quiet interventions within the bureaucracy rather than overt public protest guided by a hope that the nazi regime or its most extreme manifestations would not last longheisenberg also became the target of ideological attacks a coterie of naziaffiliated physicists promoted the idea of a “german” or “aryan” physics opposed to a supposedly “jewish” influence manifested in abstract mathematical approaches—above all relativity and quantum theories johannes stark a leader of this movement used his nazi party connections to assert influence over science funding and personnel decisions sommerfeld had long regarded heisenberg as his eventual successor and in  heisenberg received a call to join the university of munich thereupon the official ss journal published an article signed by stark that called heisenberg a “white jew” and the “ossietzky of physics” german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky winner of the  nobel prize for peace had been imprisoned in  for treason for his reporting of germany’s secret rearmament efforts given amnesty in  and then rearrested and interned in a concentration camp by the nazis in  connect with britannica facebook twitter youtube instagram pinterest heisenberg relying on the acquaintance of his mother’s family with heinrich himmler’s family sent a request to the ss chief to intervene on his behalf in acquiring the professorship in munich himmler after an investigation decreed a compromise heisenberg would not succeed sommerfeld in munich but he would be spared further personal attacks and essentially promised another prominent post in the future meanwhile stark and the aryan physicists were for other reasons losing influence in the bureaucratic jungle of the nazi state particularly in the context of militarization amid this political turbulence heisenberg apparently never seriously contemplated leaving germany though he certainly received several offers of university appointments in the united states and elsewhere apparently he was guided by a strong sense of personal duty to the profession and a national loyalty that in his mind transcended the particular politics of the regimein  heisenberg married elisabeth schumacher the daughter of an economics professor whom he had met at a concert twins were born the next year the first of eventually seven children for the coupleheisenberg’s main focus of work in the late s was highenergy cosmic rays for which he proposed a theory of “explosion showers” in which multiple particles were produced in a single process in contrast to the “cascade” theory principally favoured by british and american physicists heisenberg also saw in cosmicray phenomena possible evidence for his idea of a minimum length marking a lower boundary of the domain of quantum mechanicsworld war ii trending topics deepwater horizon oil spill of  nelson mandela korean war american civil rights movement vietnam war renaissance aristotle ottoman empire scaramouche list of cities and towns in the united states the discovery of nuclear fission pushed the atomic nucleus into the centre of attention after the german invasion of poland in  heisenberg was drafted to work for the army weapons bureau on the problem of nuclear energy at first commuting between leipzig and the kaiser wilhelm institute kwi for physics in berlin and after  as director at the latter heisenberg took on a leading role in germany’s nuclear research given the nazi context this role has been enormously controversial heisenberg’s research group was unsuccessful of course in producing a reactor or an atomic bomb in explanation some accounts have presented heisenberg as simply incompetent others conversely have suggested that he deliberately delayed or sabotaged the effort it is clear in retrospect that there were indeed critical mistakes at several points in the research likewise it is apparent that the german nuclear weapons project as a whole was not possessed of the same degree of enthusiasm that pervaded the manhattan project in the united states however factors outside heisenberg’s direct control had a more substantive role in the outcomein contrast to the unified angloamerican effort the german project was bureaucratically fractured and cut off from international collaboration key materials were in short supply in germany to say nothing of the widespread dislocations caused by allied bombing of the country’s transportation network moreover the overall strategic perspective critically affected the prioritization or deprioritization of nuclear bomb research after a  conference with axis scientists german minister for armaments and war production albert speer concluded that reactor research should proceed but that any bomb was unlikely to be developed in time for use in the war by way of confirmation the official start of the manhattan project in the united states also occurred in  and even with its massive effort it could not produce an atomic bomb before germany’s surrendercontroversy has also swirled around heisenberg’s lectures in countries such as denmark and the netherlands during the war years these trips outside of germany were necessarily taken with the approval of german authorities and hence were perceived by colleagues in the occupied countries as indicating nazi leaders’ endorsement of heisenberg and vice versa most notorious in this regard was a trip to copenhagen in september  during which heisenberg raised the subject of nuclear weapons research in a conversation with bohr offending and alarming the latter though heisenberg later claimed that bohr’s reaction rested on some misunderstanding the exact content of the conversation has never been clarifiedby january  the kwi for physics was evacuated to the towns of hechingen and haigerloch in the province of hohenzollern then a prussian enclave now part of the state of badenwürttemberg in the closing days of the war heisenberg bicycled from there to his family’s vacation house in bavaria there he was captured by an american military intelligence team and eventually he was interned with several other german physicists in england their conversations after news of the atomic bombing of hiroshima japan initially suggested that heisenberg had no clear sense of some basic principles of bomb design—eg the approximate critical mass—but within a few days he had solved many of these problemspostwar yearsheisenberg was released by the british authorities in january  and soon thereafter he resumed his directorship of the reconstituted kaiser wilhelm which was soon renamed the max planck institute for physics now in göttingen in the postwar years heisenberg took on a variety of roles as an administrator of and spokesman for german science within west germany a shift to a more overtly political role that was in some contrast to his more apolitical stance before  in  heisenberg became the first president of the german research council a consortium of the max planck society and the various west german academies of science that sought to promote german science in the international arena and to influence federal science funding through the newly elected chancellor konrad adenauer however this new organization encountered conflict with the older now reestablished emergency association for german science whose approach preserved the traditional primacy of the various german states in cultural and educational matters in  the research council merged with the emergency association to form the german research association beginning in  heisenberg was instrumental in germany’s participation in the creation of the european council for nuclear research cern in  heisenberg became the founding president of the third iteration of the humboldt foundation a governmentfunded organization that provided fellowships for foreign scholars to conduct research in germany despite these close connections with the federal government heisenberg also became an overt critic of adenauer’s policies as one of the “göttingen ” in  following the government’s announcement that it was considering equipping the army with americanbuilt nuclear weapons this group of nuclear scientists issued a manifesto protesting the planin the postwar period heisenberg continued his search for a comprehensive quantum field theory utilizing the “scattering matrix” approach first introduced in  and returning to the notion of a minimum universal length as a key feature in  he proposed a unified field theory—newspaper stories referred to his “world formula”—which he saw as a symmetrybased approach to the proliferation of particles then under way however support from the physics community was limited particularly with the appearance of the quark model in the s in  heisenberg also finally achieved the goal of an academic position in munich as the max planck institute for physics moved there in that year heisenberg retired from his institute directorship in richard beyler more about werner heisenberg  references found in britannica articlesassorted
