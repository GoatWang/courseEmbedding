markets fund ld  february        fund announcement for immediate release                                            february  lansdowne developed markets fund limited the fund   lansdowne developed markets master fund limited the master fund re  appointment of merrill lynch international to act as a prime broker and custodian to the master fund     the board of directors of the fund wishes to announce that with effect from  february  merrill lynch international will provide services as a prime broker and custodian to the master fund pursuant to a prime brokerage agreement dated  february  the mli prime brokerage agreement   the master fund has appointed merrill lynch international mli as prime broker and custodian pursuant to an international prime brokerage agreement supplemented by mlis standard terms and conditions of business the prime brokerage agreement under the terms of the prime brokerage agreement the services provided by mli will include the clearing and settlement of transactions financing and securities lending and in connection therewith mli will act as custodian of the master funds assets mli will in accordance with the rules of the financial services authority fsa rules  identify record and hold the master funds investments separately from any of mlis own investments and other assets such that the identity and location of the investments can be identified at any time  however owing to the nature of the law or market practice in certain jurisdictions outside the united kingdom mli may believe that in certain situations either it is in the master funds best interests for the relevant investments  to be registered or recorded in the name of mli or in the name of a third party or for reasons of applicable law and market practice it is not feasible to do otherwise  in such circumstances the master funds investments will or may be so registered or recorded as a consequence such investments may not be segregated from mlis own investments and in the event of mlis default may not be as well protected from claims made on behalf of the general creditors of mli any cash which mli holds or receives on the master funds behalf under the prime brokerage agreement will not be treated as client money and will not be subject to the client money protections conferred by the fsa rules as a consequence the master funds cash will not be segregated from mlis own cash and will be used by mli in the course of its business and the master fund will therefore rank as one of mlis general creditors in relation thereto mli may hold the master funds investments with any person appointed by mli as subcustodian including affiliates of mli  mli and such subcustodian it appoints may deposit the master funds investments with any securities depositories on such terms as such systems customarily operate and as permitted by applicable law mli shall use all due skill care and diligence in the selection and appointment of any subcustodian and be responsible to the master fund for the duration of the subcustody arrangement for satisfying itself as to the ongoing suitability of any such subcustodian to provide custodial services to the master fund  mli will make appropriate periodic enquiries to confirm that the obligations of such subcustodian continue to be competently discharged mli will be responsible for the acts and omissions of any subcustodian which is an affiliate of or a nominee controlled by mli to the same extent as mli is liable for its own acts and omissions under the prime brokerage agreement mli shall not be liable for losses arising out of the acts or omissions or insolvency of any subcustodian that is not an affiliate of mli save where mli has breached its obligations under the prime brokerage agreement regarding the selection appointment and ensuring the ongoing suitability of the subcustodian or where mli has been negligent in the selection of any such subcustodian as security for the payment and discharge of all liabilities of the master fund to mli and its affiliates all investments and cash held by or to the order of mli and its affiliates owed by mli and its affiliates to the master fund or credited to any account in the books of mli and any affiliate for the benefit of the master fund and all the master funds right title and interest in and under certain other agreements with mli and its affiliates will be charged by the master fund in favour of mli and will therefore constitute collateral for the purposes of the fsa rules investments and cash may also be deposited by the master fund with mli as margin and will also constitute collateral for the purposes of the fsa rules the master funds investments held by mli may be used by mli for its own purposes or the purposes of any third party provided that any such use shall not exceed  per cent of the master funds indebtedness as defined in the prime brokerage agreement whereupon such investments will become the property of mli and the master fund will have a right against mli for the return of equivalent assets in the event of an insolvency of mli the master fund will rank as an unsecured creditor in relation thereto and in such case the master fund may not be able to recover such equivalent assets in full neither mli  nor any affiliate will be liable for any loss to the master fund resulting from any act or omission of mli or an affiliate under the prime brokerage agreement or in connection with provision of any services pursuant to the prime brokerage agreement or a breach of the prime brokerage agreement by mli or an affiliate or any discrepancy or error in any transaction report or statement of account unless such loss results from the negligence wilful default or fraud of mli or any of its affiliates neither mli nor any affiliate will be liable for any loss to the master fund resulting from the acts or omissions or insolvency of any subcustodian which is not an affiliate of mli save where mli has breached its obligations under the prime brokerage agreement regarding the selection appointment and ensuring the ongoing suitability of the subcustodian or mli has been negligent in the selection of any such
