stacked caps smps soldering recommendations for ceramic stacked capacitors click for enhanced viewprintable pdf the following are general recommendations for soldering of ceramic stacked capacitors in general presidio components recommends against hand soldering for this type of large ceramic device however if hand soldering cannot be avoided it should be done with care to avoid thermally cracking the parts soldering of these parts to the circuit board if done in a careless manner is the most likely source of reliability problems preheating and mounting for reflow soldering the parts should be preheated to within °c  °c of the reflow temperature or as close as is practical a convectionstyle reflow oven with nitrogen is ideal but other types of reflow will also work the heatup and cooldown rates dtdt should be kept well under °csec and preferably under °csec after soldering allow the parts to air cool to room temperature before cleaning note presidio components parts are designed to reliably withstand reflow temperatures of °c maximum if higher temperature reflow is required consult factory hand soldering if hand soldering must be used preheat the parts as recommended above a hotair gun is an ideal tool for preheating when hand soldering avoid excessive heat and keep the tip of the soldering iron as far away from the ceramic as possible as an example for throughhole leaded parts solder from the backside of the board this will minimize the risk of thermally cracking the ceramic after soldering allow the parts to air cool to room temperature before cleaning pretinning leads the leads do not need to be pretinned as they have already been tinned with sn as part of our process in addition to the above the following rules apply • do not dip stacked capacitors into a solder pot to pretin for example • do not touchup a solder joint with a soldering iron if touch up is necessary follow preheating and hand soldering recommendations above • do not deform leads or use excessive force to install parts further in accordance with milprf the following precaution should be followed precautionary note capacitors covered by this specification sheet are very susceptible to thermal shock damage due to their large ceramic mass temperature profiles used should provide adequate temperature rise and cooldown time to prevent damage from thermal shock     top    presidio

broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering subject to the terms and conditions of the notes purchase agreement we believe we are the only national vendoragnostic it services company that provides advanced endtoend solutions through local hightouch relationships to the middle market we believe we are competitively differentiated by our broad range of capabilities that we combine to offer bestinclass solutions to the middle market we incorporate highvalue services including strategy and consulting design implementation optimization and managed services as well as technology expertise and strong vendor relationships across our solutions we compete with companies such as accenture cdw deloitte ibm and optiv we categorize our competitors as • large service providers global service providers have scale and consulting capabilities but are not middlemarket focused and generally do not provide all aspects of the it value chain we combine the scale talent technical expertise and highvalue services of the large service providers with endtoend solution capabilities and a strategic middlemarket focus • local and regional providers though local and regional providers often have strong local relationships many of them have historically been focused on one or two it areas as it complexity has increased these providers have attempted to transition from a siloed approach toward a multitechnology and multivendor approach however the relatively small scale of local and regional providers makes investments across multiple integrated technology stacks financially prohibitive and as a result these competitors are increasingly getting left behind as they lack the professional and managed services capabilities in digital infrastructure cloud iot and cybersecurity also lack of capability and financial scale often excludes these providers from executing on larger multigeography projects and relationships and developing advanced services • boutique specialists many boutique specialists focus in one distinct solution area rather than developing deep capabilities across the full range of it challenges facing clients today these firms are also typically subscale in terms of geographic coverage limiting their abilities to service larger multilocationmultinational customers our technical knowhow across technologies and vendors combined with our scale and broad client base gives us the ability to deliver endtoend offerings to much larger and more diverse end markets as technologies continue to grow in complexity and interdependency these providers will struggle to service client’s needs • resellers rather than focusing principally on product resale we focus on consulting solution delivery and ongoing services that allow us to develop longlasting client relationships our lifecycle engagement model focuses on a holistic approach that includes highvalue services and endtoend solutions company description presidio is a leading provider of information technology “it” solutions to the middle market in north america we enable business transformation through our expertise in it solutions with a specific focus on digital infrastructure cloud and security solutions our solutions are delivered through a broad suite of professional services including strategy consulting design and implementation we complement our professional services with project management technology acquisition managed services maintenance and support to offer a full lifecycle model our servicesled lifecycle model leads to ongoing client engagement as of june   we serve approximately  middlemarket large and government organizations across a diverse range of industries we have three solution areas i digital infrastructure ii cloud and iii security through our increasing focus on cloud and security we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rapid growth in demand for these technologies and expect our business mix to continue shifting toward them within our three solutions areas we offer customers enterpriseclass solutions that are critical to driving digital transformation and expanding business capabilities examples of our solutions include advanced networking internet of things “iot” data center modernization hybrid and multicloud cyber risk management enterprise mobility and management of data from sensors cameras wearables and machines that can be accessed and shaped to derive actionable insights and business outcomes “data analytics” these solutions are enabled by our expertise in foundational technologies built upon our investments in network data center security collaboration and mobility the middle market is a highly attractive segment of the it services market we believe we are the leading middlemarket provider of it solutions and are differentiated by our strategic focus on this attractive segment the increasing potential and complexity of emerging technologies and digital transformation are creating more demand for our solutions and services as a trusted solutions provider our clients rely on us for it investment decisions we simplify it for them by building solutions utilizing what we view as the best possible technologies customers in the middle market are usually large enough to have substantial technology needs but typically have fewer it resources and lack the broad expertise required to develop the necessary solutions as compared to larger companies since many largescale it services providers focus on larger enterprises and because many resellers are unable to provide endtoend solutions we believe the middle market has remained underpenetrated and underserved we develop and maintain our longterm client relationships through a localized direct sales force of over  employees based in over  offices across the united states as of june   as a strategic partner and trusted advisor to our clients we provide the expertise to implement new solutions as well as optimize and better leverage existing it resources we provide strategy consulting design customized deployment integration and lifecycle management through our team of approximately  engineers as of june   enabling us to architect and manage the ideal it solutions for our clients our local delivery model combining relationship managers and expert engineering teams allows us to win retain and expand our client relationships our client base is diversified across individual customers and industry verticals in our fiscal year ended june   only  of our revenue was attributable to our top  clients by revenue and no industry vertical accounted for more than  of our revenue among the verticals that we serve healthcare professional services financial services governments and education are our largest categories we believe that our diversified business profile is a key driver of our ability to generate growth across different economic and technology cycles our strategic focus on the middle market and highgrowth solutions areas has enabled us to achieve  annualized growth in our revenue from our fiscal year ended june   to our fiscal year ended june   over the same period we have significantly outpaced the overall it market growth rate according to gartner we believe that we are well positioned for continued success as it becomes more
