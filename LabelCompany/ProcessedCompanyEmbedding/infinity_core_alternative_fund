as advisors increasingly seek to incorporate alternative investment strategies into their clients’ portfolios one of the leaders in hedge fund of funds infinity capital partners has partnered with vivaldi asset management to offer a registered multistrategy investment fund with a minimum investment of  that invests in leading hedge funds infinity core alternative fund nasdaq zvamix a closedend interval fund of funds was launched on april   and has assets of  million vivaldi asset management llc a sec registered investment advisor ria providing alternative investment solutions to independent rias and financial intermediaries is the investment advisor infinity capital advisors llc a division of infinity capital partners an independent privatelyowned fund of hedge funds manager is the subadvisor the fund is available to accredited investors with assets outside of their primary residence of  million or more or annual income of at least  advisors can purchase the fund through a number of platforms including schwab fidelity td ameritrade pershing jp morgan and millennium trust “the fund allows advisors to allocate to leading hedge funds at a smaller minimum of  than most hedge funds offer” said michael peck president and cochief investment officer of vivaldi asset management the fund’s advisor “we chose to partner with infinity capital partners to subadvise the fund because they have a track record of successfully managing a multistrategy fund of funds since ” “our experience and deep relationships give us access to a diversified roster of leading hedge fund managers” said jeff vale chief investment officer of infinity capital partners “we only work with blue chip institutional quality managers their typical minimums of  million or more are outside the reach of many investors” infinity’s chief investment officer jeff vale answered a few questions about the infinity core alternatives fund and its investment process q how do you select the multistrategy hedge fund managers for your portfolio a we screen the universe of roughly  to  hedge funds for managers that employ a multistrategy approach a minimum of a year operating history and  billion in assets under management that narrows the universe to roughly  funds that meet these criteria the one constant of our selected managers is their relentless focus on risk management we seek to find the best riskmanaged hedge fund managers with long histories of delivering high sharpe ratio returns or the highest returns for the risks taken we perform roughly two years of due diligence before making an initial investment with a manager q what is your objective with the fund a we seek to consistently maximize returns relative to risk the investment objective of the fund is to seek longterm capital growth the fund invests primarily in other hedge funds that invest or trade in a wide range of securities and to a lesser extent other property and currency interests the underlying managers have exposure to a broad range of strategies across a wide range of security types and regions primary strategies include longshort equity distressed securities event driven quantitative equity and securities arbitrage q who should consider this fund a the fund is appropriate for accredited investors who are seeking an alternative investment with low correlation to traditional equity and fixed income asset classes the fund offers diversified exposure within the alternative asset class and is a true complement to liquid alternative investments the fund may also be appropriate for an investor seeking attractive returns and downside protection q do you move assets around between managers or make tactical allocation decisions a no we push down the tactical allocation decisions to the multistrategy hedge fund managers with whom we invest we neither use hedge overlays nor try to outsmart the managers we have hired all of our hedge fund managers are global with many employees significant resources on the ground and opportunity sets that are broad and wellresearched q how do you determine how much is allocated to each manager a we strive to manage a balanced portfolio in practice the weights vary we manage against capacity as some managers may be hard or soft closed we believe in a concentrated approach with a portfolio of  to  managers although we do not want any one manager to represent more than  of the portfolio we rebalance the portfolio as needed however we do not actively trade the portfolio use leverage or employ hedge overlays q how do you monitor the selected hedge fund managers a we communicate regularly with the managers to gain insight into portfolio opportunities and their risk management process we have longstanding relationships with each manager including senior management portfolio managers research analysts and their investor relations professionals they recognize we are generally long term investors have committed capital and they know and trust us q why did you choose to offer a registered closedend investment fund instead of a liquid alternative mutual fund a daily liquidity and the overall constraints of a mutual fund limit the spectrum and opportunity set of hedge fund strategies some of the most attractive and noncorrelated strategies cannot be executed in a daily liquid fund structure our structure and committed capital enables our selected multistrategy managers to seek out the most opportunistic strategies and deploy capital based on risk and not necessarily be constrained by the fund’s structure the fund offers quarterly liquidity this means that advisors need to commit only those assets that can remain invested and that their clients will not need access to in the short term q what are the fees on the fund a the management fee is  and other expenses are  however fees and expenses are capped at  or  basis points the advisor at their option may also charge a maximum sales charge of  the underlying fund expenses are  we believe alpha is expensive and we are willing to pay for that however beta is cheap the structure allows us to bring traditional fund of hedge funds to a broader
