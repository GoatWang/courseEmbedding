companies in the united states with businesses in the insurance energy and hospitality industries  three of our subsidiaries are publicly traded cna financial corporation diamond offshore drilling and boardwalk pipeline partners and our fourth subsidiary loews hotels is whollyowned  loews is focused on longterm value creation for its shareholders and conservative financial management loews’s multiindustry holding company structure is a key factor in our ability to create value providing us with the freedom to make investments across a broad spectrum of industries wherever we perceive the opportunity to enhance returns to our shareholders loews is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol l overview leadership jonathan tisch cochairman andrew tisch cochairman and james tisch president  ceo go to leadership letter to our shareholders  loews corporation subsidiaryoverview go to loewshotelscom   home annual report letter to our shareholders let’s cut to the chase for this year’s letter instead of comprehensively reviewing  we thought we’d start by addressing the two questions we have heard most often from shareholders lately why did we purchase relatively few loews shares in  why hasn’t loews made an acquisition recently the answers to these questions illustrate our fundamental approach to creating longterm shareholder value and the ways in which we allocate capital to achieve that goal in  we purchased  million shares of loews stock or about  of our outstanding shares at an average price of just under  per share about  million of those shares were repurchased during the first half of the year as the equity markets climbed to record heights during the second half of  and loews’s common stock moved along with them we chose to exercise caution in hindsight we could have repurchased more of our shares early in the year when loews stock was trading at lower prices and the sp  was well below its recent levels alas it must be time to get a new crystal ball unlike some companies we do not repurchase our stock robotically or set annual repurchase quotas rather we seek to buy back our stock when it’s below our estimation of its intrinsic value and when prevailing market conditions seem conducive while we remain positive on our shares and see great potential for our subsidiaries we did not see the wisdom of buying back shares in an exuberant equity market we are more comfortable buying back our shares when the market is not hitting new highs over the span of time measured in years and decades we are proud of our record and we feel that our share repurchases have created significant value for our shareholders as for the second question we continue to kick tires on potential acquisitions looking for the right acquisition at the right price valuations in the merger market have made our search difficult and frustrating the merger market today is being driven by large numbers of corporate buyers as well as by private equity funds which are under pressure to put their capital to work the abundance of private capital combined with the amount of leverage available at remarkably low rates has enabled private equity firms to pay generous prices for companies that haven’t already been gobbled up by strategic buyers our focus drives us to invest only when all the pieces of a transaction — from valuation to potential cash flow to future industry dynamics — add up to a solid investment to date we have not found a potential acquisition where all the pieces fit together the way we believe they should it’s a tough market in which to be a disciplined buyer that said our liquidity gives us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility we will never stop using our best judgment to balance risk and reward to build value for all shareholders and we are confident that despite today’s market exuberance we will find desirable opportunities in the future annual report loews’s assets currently consist of three publiclytraded subsidiaries cna financial diamond offshore drilling and boardwalk pipeline partners and loews hotels a wholly owned subsidiary as well as a large portfolio of cash and investments our unique structure gives us the freedom to make investments and acquisitions across a broad spectrum of industries wherever we see opportunity  annual report pdf loews hotels  hotel and resort investing

number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many factors get help deciding by answering a few questions here a specialist is here to

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
