pellet plants our backlog is up  versus last year we are pleased that excluding pellet plants each of our financial reporting groups increased backlog versus last year nonpellet plant backlog increased both in domestic and international markets domestically we continue to experience a good market for our products mainly as a result of the federal highway bill and other state and local level funding mechanisms internationally our strategy of keeping our sales and service structure in place despite the challenge of the strong us dollar which increases our sales prices globally for export equipment has allowed us to earn orders mainly as a result of pent up demand meeting improved global market conditions in closing mr brock commented given our current backlog and quote activity

infrastructure group  astec inc roadtec inc carlson paving products inc astec australia pty ltd and astec mobile machinery gmbh  aggregate and mining group  telsmith inc kolbergpioneer inc johnson crushers international inc osborn engineered products sa pty ltd breaker technology inc astec mobile screens inc astec do brasil fabricacao de equipamentos ltda and telestack limited  energy group  heatec inc cei inc gefco inc peterson pacific corp the company also has one other category corporate that contains the business units that do not meet the requirements for separate disclosure as a separate operating segment or inclusion in one of the other reporting segments the business units in the corporate category are astec insurance company astec insurance or the captive and astec industries inc the parent company these two companies provide support and corporate oversight for all the companies that fall within the reportable operating segments the companys financial performance is affected by a number of factors including the cyclical nature and varying conditions of the markets it serves demand in these markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to the amount of public sector spending on infrastructure development privately funded infrastructure development changes in the price of crude oil which affects the cost of fuel and liquid asphalt and changes in the price of steel the company believes that federal highway funding influences the purchasing decisions of the companys customers who are typically more comfortable making capital equipment purchases with longterm federal legislation in place federal funding provides for approximately  of all highway street roadway and parking construction in the united states in july  the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map was approved by the us federal government which authorized  billion of federal spending on highway and public transportation programs through fiscal year  in august  the us government approved shortterm funding of  billion through may  federal transportation funding operated on shortterm appropriations until december   when the fixing americas surface transportation act fast act was signed into law the  billion fast act approved funding for highways of approximately  billion and transit projects of approximately  billion for the fiveyear period ending september   the company believes a multiyear highway program such as the fast act will have the greatest positive impact on the road construction industry and allow its customers to plan and execute longerterm projects but given the inherent uncertainty in the political process the level of governmental funding for federal highway projects will similarly continue to be uncertain in late  the newlyelected administration stated one of its priorities would be a new infrastructure bill including increased funding for roads bridges tunnels airports railroads ports and waterways pipelines clean water infrastructure energy infrastructure and telecommunication needs the funding for the bill as proposed would rely in part on direct federal spending as well as increased private sector funding in exchange for federal tax credits governmental funding that is committed or earmarked for federal highway projects is always subject to repeal or reduction although continued funding under the fast act or funding of a bill passed by the new administration is expected it may be at lower levels than originally approved or anticipated in addition congress could pass legislation in future sessions that would allow for the diversion of previously appropriated highway funds for other purposes or it could restrict funding of infrastructure projects unless states comply with certain federal policies the level of future federal highway construction is uncertain and any future funding may be at levels lower than those currently approved or that have been approved in the past the public sector spending described above is needed to fund road bridge and mass transit improvements the company believes that increased funding is unquestionably needed to restore the nations highways to a quality level required for safety fuel efficiency and mitigation of congestion in the companys opinion amounts needed for such improvements are significantly greater than amounts approved to date and funding mechanisms such as the federal usage fee per gallon of gasoline which is still at the  level of  cents per gallon would likely need to be increased along with other measures to generate the funds needed in addition to public sector funding the economies in the markets the company serves the price of oil and its impact on customers purchasing decisions and the price of steel may each affect the companys financial performance economic downturns generally result in decreased purchasing by the companys customers which in turn causes reductions in sales and increased pricing pressure on the companys products rising interest rates also typically negatively impact customers attitudes toward purchasing equipment the federal reserve has maintained historically low interest rates in response to the economic downturn which began in  however the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate in  and again in early  and may implement additional increases in the future significant portions of the companys revenues from the infrastructure group relate to the sale of equipment involved in the production handling recycling or installation of asphalt mix liquid asphalt is a byproduct of oil production an increase or decrease in the price of oil impacts the cost of asphalt which is likely to alter demand for asphalt and therefore affect demand for certain company products while increasing oil prices may have a negative financial impact on many of the companys customers the companys equipment can use a significant amount of recycled asphalt pavement thereby partially mitigating the effect of increased oil prices on the final cost of asphalt for the customer the company continues to develop products and initiatives to reduce the amount of oil and related products required to produce asphalt mix oil price volatility makes it difficult to predict the costs of oilbased products used in road construction such as liquid asphalt and gasoline oil prices rose during much of  but have stabilized during the first quarter of  minor fluctuations in oil prices should not have a significant impact on customers buying decisions other factors such as political uncertainty in oil producing countries interruptions in oil production due to disasters whether natural or manmade or other economic factors could significantly impact oil prices which could negatively impact demand for the companys products however the company believes the continued funding of the fast act federal highway bill passed in december  has greater potential to impact the buying decisions of the companys customers than does the fluctuation of oil prices in  contrary to the impact of oil prices on many of the companys infrastructure group products as discussed above the products manufactured by the energy group which are used in drilling for oil and natural gas in heaters for refineries and oil sands and in double fluid pump trailers for fracking and oil and gas extraction would benefit from higher oil and natural gas prices to the extent that such higher prices lead to increased development in the oil and natural gas production industries the company believes further development of domestic oil and natural gas production capabilities is needed and would positively impact the domestic economy and the companys business steel is a major component in the companys equipment steel prices increased during the first quarter of  and the company expects this trend to continue through the second quarter of  the company continues to utilize forwardlooking contracts with no minimum or specified quantity guarantees coupled with advanced steel purchases to minimize the impact of any price increases the company will review the trends in steel prices entering into the second half of  and establish future contract pricing accordingly in addition to the factors stated above many of the companys markets are highly competitive and its products compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and dealers that produce and sell similar products from  through mid a weak us dollar combined with improving economic conditions in certain foreign economies had a positive impact on the companys international sales the strengthening of the us dollar from mid through march   has negatively impacted pricing in certain foreign markets the company serves the company expects the us dollar to remain strong in the near term relative to most foreign currencies increasing domestic interest rates or weakening economic conditions abroad could cause the us dollar to continue to strengthen which could negatively impact the companys international sales in the united states and internationally the companys equipment is marketed directly to customers as well as through dealers during  approximately  to  of equipment sold by the company was sold directly to the end user the company expects this ratio to remain relatively consistent through the end of  the company is operated on a decentralized basis with a complete management team for each operating subsidiary finance

were achieved in spite of the continuing strength of the us dollar as compared to the currencies in many of the countries in which the company operates low oil and gas pricing and the continuing
