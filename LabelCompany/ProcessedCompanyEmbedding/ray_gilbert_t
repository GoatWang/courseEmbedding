share description reviews  bobby ray gilbert is a convicted murderer in the alabama department of corrections gilbert was arrested on february   for the shooting death of walton edison brewer after a verbal altercation in which the victim refused to satisfy a prior financial agreement with gilbert  after shooting brewer gilbert then removed thirty six dollars that was owed to him from the victims wallet  although bobby gilbert was initially charged with murder during robbery which is a capital offense and carries the death penalty in the state of alabama charges were reduced to first degree murder due to gilbert leaving  in the victim’s wallet  gilbert openly admitted to his actions and pled guilty to the charges and was sentenced to life imprisonment after entering prison with the possibility of parole in ten years gilbert proceeded to accumulate one felony conviction after another  in september of  gilbert decided that he didnt want to spend the next ten years in prison  while being housed in the dekalb county jail in fort payne alabama he overpowered the jailer at knifepoint and escaped from custody  following a multicounty manhunt gilbert was recaptured in a wooded area and taken to a maximum security prison in west jefferson county in bessemeralabama  in  while again being housed in the dekalb county jail gilbert attempted yet another escape after setting fire to the jail and upon being removed from his cell by officers an altercation between gilbert and the officers ensued whereupon gilbert being armed with a singleedged razor seriously injured one officer and almost killed a second resulting in his being charged with attempted murder and assault in the first degree  the arson charge was later dropped as part of the plea agreement at this point gilbert had received a ten year sentence for escape a twenty year sentence for assault and a forty year sentence for attempted murder and was being held in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in jefferson county alabama on november   gilbert was released from solitary confinement and placed into the general population of donaldson correctional facility  four weeks after being placed in general population gilbert killed a fellow inmate in a knife altercation whereupon he was placed in solitary confinement  under alabama law anyone serving a prison sentence for a prior murder conviction who is charged in a second homicide will find it enhanced to a capital offense  during gilberts subsequent trial court records would indicate that an altercation arose after inmate andrew brown refused to follow through with his end of a transaction  testimony suggests that gilbert paid brown the amount of one carton of cigarettes inmate currency to affect a cell change for gilbert  when gilbert discovered that his move to a different cell location had not been approved by the prison administration he confronted inmate brown and demanded that brown pay back the carton of cigarettes  at this point brown refused threats were exchanged and both men subsequently armed themselves with prison made knives testimony by the states pathologist confirmed the cause of andrew browns death as being multiple stab wounds to the chest abdomen and back  in  gilbert was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole  he would spend a total of seven years in solitary confinement for the death of andrew brown where he would accrue an additional  year sentence for promoting prison contraband in  gilbert would be charged with two counts of assault while being housed in the special management unit at donaldson correctional facility while in the process of stabbing another inmate he also stabbed an officer who attempted to intervene  six years later gilbert would once again be released from solitary confinement into another prisons general population this time in holman correctional facility in atmore alabama exactly  days later gilbert would find himself in yet another violent altercation this time over an fhm magazine which led to inmate harold cutman being taken from the prison to an outside medical facility where he would receive a total of  stitches  for his part gilbert received a black eye and another life sentence for attempted murder  in  gilbert would accrue yet another  year sentence for promoting prison contraband for the second time  in july  bobby snake gilbert as hes come to be known amongst his friends thwarted the execution of death row inmate thomas arthur when gilbert confessed to being the actual killer of troy wicker victim for which arthur was convicted of murdering while arthur remains on death row authorities continue to disprove gilberts claim so as to proceed with arthurs execution as of  the issue remains unresolved due to gilberts violent nature and assault within the prison system he spent  of the first  years in prison in solitary confinement where he developed his latent art skills and as a result was featured on several episodes of msnbcs lockup xdrawing done in pencil on arches watercolor paper titled art supplies  gilbert signed this piece twice once on the

to buy appliances from spencers for our new home and to help my mom purchase a new fridge for her home we were greeted by tim and he was very easy to work with he wasnt the type to hover over your shoulder while you were browsing and i appreciated that i asked him several detailed questions and i felt confident in his product knowledge when it came time to order it was easy i felt the pricing was really great i have used spencers for several new homes and each time i have added extended warranty on the fridge products just arent built as well as they were before and i have had to use the warranty in the past i have not had issues with any other appliances washers microwaves etc in the past dealing with their warranty folks was fine no issues and honestly needing a warranty on fridges is not spencers fault but speaks more to the industry as a whole anyhow the buying part was great tim gave us a good deal once the new home is built and we deliver i will update the review on that portion of the experience thanks me and my husband came here for some new appliances the sales guy was nice enough  but here is my issues came back here again and their staff is very uninterested and apathetic in every way  everyone looked miserable the guy we originally came to see was off  so of course no one really wants to help since they work on commission the apathetic salesman left us for several minutes couldnt honor the price they made a week ago told us we should of put a  dollars down no one told us that  and to comeback  ive never seen a place more unwilling to make a sale in my life  very unpleasant experience save your money go somewhere else by the way we did go somewhere else and just spent    learn some customer service skills spencers  i needed a new refrigerator for my new home and had bought from spencers before in gilbert this time i went to spencers on power road and ray tim brinkerhoff was so nice to me when i went back to pay my refrigerator balance it was marked down even further and he honored that price cant ask for more than that and i love my refrigerator we purchased new kitchen appliances microwave refrigerator dishwasher and gas stove best prices compared to best buy sears with prompt delivery however the delivery person did not hook the water to the refrigerator properly and did not return when he said he would sales made a mistake and charged us twice for hook up kit but quickly refunded the money as soon as the mistake was realized i would have given  stars but delivery and install left me disappointed this review is for the spencers used store only the gentleman at the front desk was very polite and accommodating he waited for us to purchase a refrigerator for about an hour after they had already closed on top of him being so helpful with everything he also gave us an amazing deal and helped my husband load it into our truck we will refer everyone we know to this location and i am sure we will be back should we need anything else appliance wise you wont be disappointed made a fairly large purchase of a lg washer and dryer ge cafe fridge and a water softener and ro for approx k when the fridge was delivered we were having an issue with it fitting and we were unsure if it would work or not the delivery company spencers used was horrible while we were told we would get a call  minutes before the guy would only tell me they were on the way but literally refused to say where they were coming from which set a bad tone the guys were extremely rude to my wife and while we were attempting to figure it out the salesperson from spencers called me to tell me we had to make a decision if we were keeping it or not this was literally a  minute process and i indicated to the salesperson that everyone could wait a couple minutes while we decided or i would return everything we decided to return the fridge and had to have it redelivered the following week this was about a month ago and on the nd delivery the delivery person pushed the fridge into our rand new kitchen cabinets causing a big chunk to be taken out of them we noticed this shortly after they left and immediately called the salesperson and texted him to which he replied that i had to call the delivery company from the number they called me but we had accepted the delivery delivery company never responded to us and spencers has sent us multiple texts that i would be hearing from them and management to which i have never heard from anyone additionally we have already had to make two warranty calls on the fridge because the freezer is not working correctly and is thawing and refreezing still trying to get that fixed also found it the delivery guys left the ice maker in the on position with no water line run to it which the warranty service person said is a huge nono washer and dryer seem to work fine water system is working nicely but the service delivery and follow up has been a joke salesperson shouldnt text me saying i will hear from people if they are all lies would never purchase from them again second trip here to buy washerdryer combo fridge tv water softener  reverse osmosis system first time here we were just looking cause we had never heard of them before jim was fantastic answered all our questions both times compared models for me  didnt pressure us at all to make the sale we heard about them by accident  will be coming back for any future appliance needs never again will i purchase anything from spencers i purchased a washer and dryer back in  exactly one year later the washer door randomly stops locking i call spencers only to be told in so many words that the machine is not broken enough the issue continues and i call a few more times and still they will not come out and fix the machine well they can however if they do come out and the machine door lock function just so happens to work they will have to charge me for the visit what a load of crap heres the thing i dont like the idea of having strangers in my home i am not calling and complaining for fun im calling because after paying  for a washer i would think it should work for more than a year fast forward to present day and the washing machine is finally broken the door has failed to lock for a full day i call at  am on a thursday only to find out that the warranty is not through the company i was referred to by spencers so that company gives me the number to call the next warranty company tells me that they do not have my name on file soooooo they give me another number to call and this warranty company gives me the number to some local place for me to call and schedule an appointment for a technician to come out the local repair place that i scheduled the appointment with calls me back to tell me that they no longer do work for the warranty company i am with i call the warranty company back and they give me the number to another place i call them and by now its  and they are out to lunch i finally get a hold of them and the soonest they can be out is monday monday rolls around and the technician arrives as scheduled he sees that the door lock is indeed broken and tells me that the part needs to be ordered and it will be  business days before it comes in and the order for the part will be submitted the next day not today mind you its am okay deeeep breath its now thursday of the following week and i call the repair shop to check on the status the lady tells me that parts typically take  business days and not  as i was told by the technician spencers shame on you for such poor service we got a great deal on the washer and dryer but i would have gladly paid the extra money if it meant getting a quality item and better service we recently moved to the area and shopped around for a new washer dryer dishwasher and double oven spencers had the best prices by far the employees were helpful and attentive but not pushy which is important to me the only bummer was that the washer and dryer were delivered on the same day but on a different truck from the oven and dishwasher the deliveries ended up arriving about three hours apart when we set up our delivery i assumed they would all come at the same time so that i wouldnt be sitting in a vacant house waiting for the second half of our order it was an inconvenience but overall im happy with our experience the appliances are great and im happy with what we paid this place is horrible we purchased a full kitchen packageand a few tvs the stove was not working properly so they sent a tech out to look at it the stove was not properly insulated and i had burned myself on it the day prior i told spencers i wanted a new set they said they would replace the stove and i said no way i paid for a matching set and that is what i want there was a gentlemen there that went above and beyond to help us and needless to say the ahole joke of a manager fired him after they had picked up the whole set and provided us a new one of course after i threatened a lawsuit for my burn i had got across my stomach they also say they price match which is untrue we found the same set at home depot and when the employee said he would send us a check for the difference he was fired by the cocky fake rolex wearing pos mercedes driving jerk of a manager we will never ever go there again and hopefully you will not either great

and to help my mom purchase a new fridge for her home we were greeted by tim and he was very easy to work with he wasnt the type to hover over your shoulder while you were browsing and i appreciated that i asked him several detailed questions and i felt confident in his product knowledge when it came time to order it was easy i felt the pricing was really great i have used spencers for several new homes and each time i have added extended warranty on the fridge products just arent built as well as they were before and i have had to use the warranty in the past i have not had issues with any other appliances washers microwaves etc in the past dealing with their warranty folks was fine no issues and honestly needing a warranty on fridges is not spencers fault but speaks more to the industry as a whole anyhow the buying part was great tim gave us a good deal once the new home is built and we deliver i will update the review on that portion of the experience thanks me and my husband came here for some new appliances the sales guy was nice enough  but here is my issues came back here again and their staff is very uninterested and apathetic in every way  everyone looked miserable the guy we originally came to see was off  so of course no one really wants to help since they work on commission the apathetic salesman left us for several minutes couldnt honor the price they made a week ago told us we should of put a  dollars down no one told us that  and to comeback  ive never seen a place more unwilling to make a sale in my life  very unpleasant experience save your money go somewhere else by the way we did go somewhere else and just spent    learn some customer service skills spencers  i needed a new refrigerator for my new home and had bought from spencers before in gilbert this time i went to spencers on power road and ray tim brinkerhoff was so nice to me when i went back to pay my refrigerator balance it was marked down even further and he honored that price cant ask for more than that and i love my refrigerator we purchased new kitchen appliances microwave refrigerator dishwasher and gas stove best prices compared to best buy sears with prompt delivery however the delivery person did not hook the water to the refrigerator properly and did not return when he said he would sales made a mistake and charged us twice for hook up kit but quickly refunded the money as soon as the mistake was realized i would have given  stars but delivery and install left me disappointed this review is for the spencers used store only the gentleman at the front desk was very polite and accommodating he waited for us to purchase a refrigerator for about an hour after they had already closed on top of him being so helpful with everything he also gave us an amazing deal and helped my husband load it into our truck we will refer everyone we know to this location and i am sure we will be back should we need anything else appliance wise you wont be disappointed made a fairly large purchase of a lg washer and dryer ge cafe fridge and a water softener and ro for approx k when the fridge was delivered we were having an issue with it fitting and we were unsure if it would work or not the delivery company spencers used was horrible while we were told we would get a call  minutes before the guy would only tell me they were on the way but literally refused to say where they were coming from which set a bad tone the guys were extremely rude to my wife and while we were attempting to figure it out the salesperson from spencers called me to tell me we had to make a decision if we were keeping it or not this was literally a  minute process and i indicated to the salesperson that everyone could wait a couple minutes while we decided or i would return everything we decided to return the fridge and had to have it redelivered the following week this was about a month ago and on the nd delivery the delivery person pushed the fridge into our rand new kitchen cabinets causing a big chunk to be taken out of them we noticed this shortly after they left and immediately called the salesperson and texted him to which he replied that i had to call the delivery company from the number they called me but we had accepted the delivery delivery company never responded to us and spencers has sent us multiple texts that i would be hearing from them and management to which i have never heard from anyone additionally we have already had to make two warranty calls on the fridge because the freezer is not working correctly and is thawing and refreezing still trying to get that fixed also found it the delivery guys left the ice maker in the on position with no water line run to it which the warranty service person said is a huge nono washer and dryer seem to work fine water system is working nicely but the service delivery and follow up has been a joke salesperson shouldnt text me saying i will hear from people if they are all lies would never purchase from them again second trip here to buy washerdryer combo fridge tv water softener  reverse osmosis system first time here we were just looking cause we had never heard of them before jim was fantastic answered all our questions both times compared models for me  didnt pressure us at all to make the sale we heard about them by accident  will be coming back for any

while we were told we would get a call  minutes before the guy would only tell me they were on the way but literally refused to say where they were coming from which set a bad tone the guys were extremely rude to my wife and while we were attempting to figure it out the salesperson from spencers called me to tell me we had to make a decision if we were keeping it or not this was literally a  minute process and i indicated to the salesperson that everyone could wait a couple minutes while we decided or i would return everything we decided to return the fridge and had to have it redelivered the following week this was about a month ago and on the nd delivery the delivery person pushed the fridge into our rand new kitchen cabinets causing a big chunk to be taken out of them we noticed this shortly after they left and immediately called the salesperson and texted him to which he replied that i had to call the delivery company from the number they called me but we had accepted the delivery delivery company never responded to us and spencers has sent us multiple texts that i would be hearing from them and management to which i have never heard from anyone additionally we have already had to make two warranty calls on the fridge because the freezer is not working correctly and is thawing and refreezing still trying to get that fixed also found it the delivery guys left the ice maker in the on position with no water line run to it which the warranty service person said is a huge nono washer and dryer seem to work fine water system is working nicely but the service delivery and follow up has been a joke salesperson shouldnt text me saying i will hear from people if they are all lies would never purchase from them again was this review … useful funny cool jenn k

compliment send message follow m c stop following m c  never again will i purchase anything from spencers i purchased a washer and dryer back in  exactly one year later the washer door randomly stops locking i call spencers only to be told in so many words that the machine is not broken enough the issue continues and i call a few more times and still they will not come out and fix the machine well they can however if they do come out and the machine door lock function just so happens to work they will have to charge me for the visit what a load of crap heres the thing i dont like the idea of having strangers in my home i am not calling and complaining for fun im calling because after paying  for a washer i would think it should work for more than a year fast forward to present day and the washing machine is finally broken the door has failed to lock for a full day i call at  am on a thursday only to find out that the warranty is not through the company i was referred to by spencers so that company gives me the number to call the next warranty company tells me that they do not have my name on file soooooo they give me another number to call and this warranty company gives me the number to some local place for me to call and schedule an appointment for a technician to come out the local repair place that i scheduled the appointment with calls me back to tell me that they no longer do work for the warranty company i am with i call the warranty company back and they give me the number to another place i call them and by now its  and they are out to lunch i finally get a hold of them and the soonest they can be out is monday monday rolls around and the technician arrives as scheduled he sees that the door lock is indeed broken and tells me that the part needs to be ordered and it will be  business days before it comes in and the order for the part will be submitted the next day not today mind you its am okay deeeep breath its now thursday of the following week and i call the repair shop to check on the status the lady tells me that parts typically take  business days and not  as i was told by the technician spencers shame on you for such poor service we got a great deal on the washer and dryer but i would have gladly paid the extra money if it meant getting a quality item and better service was this review … useful funny cool katie a gilbert az  friends  reviews  photo share review embed review compliment send message follow katie a stop following katie a  we recently moved to the area and shopped around for a new washer dryer dishwasher and double oven  spencers had the best prices by far  the employees were helpful and attentive but not pushy which is important to me  the only bummer was that the washer and dryer were delivered on the same day but on a different truck from the oven and dishwasher  the deliveries ended up arriving about three hours apart  when we set up our delivery i assumed they would all come at the same time so that i wouldnt be sitting in a vacant house waiting for the second half of our order  it was an inconvenience but overall im happy with our experience  the appliances are great and im happy with what we paid was this review … useful funny cool comment from matt k of spencers tv  appliance business customer service  katiethank you again for choosing spencers  we strive to be the best not only in prices but also… katiethank you again for choosing spencers  we strive to be the best not only in prices but also in our customer service  i want to give my sincerest apologies you i can understand how separate deliveries can be cumbersome and inconsiderate of your time  i will definitely make sure this doesnt happen again your feedback is invaluablethank you againbestmatt k read more a b san tan valley az  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow a b stop following a b  this place is horrible  we purchased a full kitchen packageand a few tvs  the stove was not working properly so they sent a tech out to look at it  the stove was not properly insulated and i had burned myself on it the day prior  i told spencers i wanted a new set  they said they would replace the stove and i said no way i paid for a matching set and that is what i want  there was a gentlemen there that went above and beyond to help us and needless to say the ahole joke of a manager fired him after they had picked up the whole set and provided us a new one  of course after i threatened a lawsuit for my burn i had got across my stomach  they also say they price match which is untrue  we found the same set at home depot and when the employee said he would send us a check for the difference he was fired by the cocky fake rolex wearing pos mercedes driving jerk of a manager  we will never ever go there again and hopefully you will not either was this review … useful  funny cool dwayne d gilbert az  friend  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow
