and media coverage of princess dianamedium  print medianew york times meduim  broadcast mediahours following the crash news stations around the world presented the breaking news that diana was involved in a car crash and later confirmed her death this broadcast was one of the first to report the news to people in the united states the msnbc coverage begins with live footage of the scene of the crash and later gives the update that diana died in the crash the anchor goes on to talk about the state of the royal family which gives a more personal perspective to her death footage of the actual car motorcycles and location are very detailed and zoomed in putting the viewer at the scene of the accident the video does not go into a lot of detail because few facts were actually known during the time of the breaking news it leaves a lot of questions unanswered but is able to alert viewers very quickly after the crash occurred httpwwwcnncomworlddianadeadtomrichardsonaiffhttpwwwcnncomworlddianadeadjoannaluzaiffhttpwwwcnncomworlddianadeadmikewalkeraiffjoanna luzit was a blue mercedes and the airbag was on the passenger side for sure and the horn right after the huge explosion there was a horn  for about two minutes and i think that was the driver up against the steering wheeltom richardsonso i and another gentleman ran into the tunnel to see if we could help anybody get out of the car and a gentleman at the car at the scene was starting to run towards us out of the tunnel like the car was about to explode so we turned and ran out of the tunnel bout fifteen seconds later we turned arounder the paparazzi snapping off picturesrecording of eyewitness reportswell we was coming from the eiffel tower and we were coming down he was coming one way and we were coming down the hill and the traffic there was a little traffic so it was going slow there because the accident had just happened and when we got there we seen either the car had flipped over and it looked like it had hit another car looked like it had evidently hit the wall or something he saidmedium  recording of eyewitness reportsfollowing the initial reaction and footage of the crash several witness reports were aired and made public the three included all give a different viewpoint of the crash but when combined paint a vivid picture of what it was like to be at the scene two of the three talk about experiencing the explosion of the car eyewitness tom richardson explains how the paparazzi were present at the scene and were taking pictures of the car while diana and two others were still in the car this is a very intense description which lead many to believe that if the paparazzi had helped the victims instead of taking pictures diana and the others may not have died autopsy reports later explain that diana was alive postcrash which lead to further blame on the paparazzi hearing the voices of people who witnessed the accident allows me to picture myself in that tunnel seeing the aftermath of the crash the audio provides a human view to the accident and the surroundings at the time diana spencer the former princess of england was killed in a tragic car accident in august  the relentless paparazzi trailing her car that night were believed to be a contributing factor to the crash the accident received extensive media coverage which resulted in exploitation false rumors and questioning of the royal familymedium photos from the crash and funeral magazine reportsdays following the crash images of the car began to circulate on print media and television the photos allowed millions to see what it looked like the night of the accident one image in particular shows the burnt face of a blonde woman diana in the car this is the only known photograph of diana postcrash because most paparazzi photos were confiscated images of diana and the crash were on numerous magazine and newspaper covers following her death many of these sources circulated false rumors about diana her relationships and the royal family i believe that the photographs are a key piece in the media coverage of her death because they illustrate just how serious the crash was it is near impossible to imagine people being crushed inside the car or how scary it must have been for those involved the photographs bring to life the eyewitness reports and add a clearer visual to the news reports additionally photos from her funeral the palace and of her family bring more emotion to her death and reemphasize that she was a person who had a life outside of what the media illustratedhover for audio playback hover for audio playback hover for audio playback paris sunday aug   diana the princess of wales was killed shortly after midnight today in an automobile accident in a tunnel by the seine the accident also killed emad mohammed alfayed the harrods heir and their driver the police saiddianas death was announced this morning by the interior minister jeanpierre chevenement she died after being hospitalized in intensive care at the pitiesalpetriere hospital in southeast parisa bodyguard was seriously injured according to a police spokesman the car was being chased by photographers on motorcycles which could have caused the accident a spokesman for the prefecture of police said several motorcyclists were detained for questioning after the crash reuters reported quoting police officialsthe princess  was divorced from prince charles the prince of wales and heir to the british throne last year she had vacationed with mr alfayed  the son of harrodss owner mohammed alfayed on the french riviera earlier this month and had been expected to return to london today to be with her two sons the princes william and harry obituaries of diana and mr alfayed appear on page french radio stations reported that a spokesman for the british royal family in london expressed anger and said the accident was predictable because photographers relentlessly pursued the princess wherever she wentthe crash occurred  minutes past midnight in the alma tunnel on the right bank of the seine under the place de lalma the police saidthis article from the new york times made headlines a day after the car crash and goes into detail on the events of the accident and who was involved the article summarizes information and imagrey from the news eyewitness reports and photographs and ties the entire event together the story really sinks in when reading the full article because it fills in the pieces that the other mediums left out concrete facts are stated and a sense of legitimacy is added to the report i appreciate how concise the article is it reports facts and does not dwell on rumors or pin fault on anyone involved i believe that this publication and others similar to it was a very effective and accessible source of news on this event and fueled a lot of its media coverage several media sources aimed at pinning her death on an individual while others claim that her death was planned by the british monarchy no reports could be legitimately proven but they circulated the idea that diana was a victim of the media and that her death could have been avoided while the images videos writings and recording are all very shocking and concerning to me the reaction from those who were older during that time must have had a much stronger reaction  million people tuned in to watch her wedding she was an advocate for numerous causes and a large icon to many people with that kind of following and notoriety the public reaction to her death and the media coverage it received was immense publication august  morning following crashmedia technology perception projectmackenzie kirkfull
