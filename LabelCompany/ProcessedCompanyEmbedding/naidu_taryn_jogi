rightsides financial performance and future events including beliefs about the growth and expansion of the domain name services industry and gtlds in particular future revenue and margins and the companys ability to successfully market and sell its new gtlds we caution you to consider the important risk factors that could cause the companys actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements made in the press release and on this conference call these risk factors are described in our press release and are more fully detailed under the caption risk factors in rightsides most recently filed annual report on form k and its other filings with the sec in addition please note that the date of this conference call is may   and any forwardlooking statements that we make today are based on the assumptions as of this date we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or events with that id like to turn the call over to taryn naidu ceo of rightside taryn jogi naidu thanks brinlea and welcome to our shareholders other investors and analysts joining our call today we announced our results for the first quarter of  reporting gaap revenue of  million for our registry business representing  growth on a yearoveryear basis our retail registrar namecom recorded revenue of  million up  yearoveryear gross margin was  up  basis points yearoveryear as we grew our mix of highermargin registry services revenue and continued to realize the benefit of our profitability initiatives operationally im also pleased to report that we have had a smooth transition following our divestiture of enom in january with our transition services agreement with tucows proceeding as expected as our obligations regarding the tsa conclude we are still making progress towards reducing the overall cost structure now let me take you through some results and recent activities with respect to the areas of strategic focus for our registry business which i introduced on the last call first premium names demonstrated success with the sale of multiple highpriced platinum names including videogames and several other live names for the quarter our cash revenue for new premium registrations premium renewals and platinum name sales all beat our internal targets our biggest registrar partners continue to experience strong results with our premium names and their merchandizing efforts are improving as well we are working hard to get these registrars and some new partners set up to sell our platinum names through their sales teams and online marketplaces for the quarter premium names accounted for approximately  of the cash revenue of our registry the rightside portfolio of new generic top level domains is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the opportunity for premium names and well continue focusing a significant portion of our sales and marketing efforts in this area our second strategic focus is the corporate brand registrars who help the biggest brands acquire and manage their domain names in q we rolled out marketing programs for new products that make it easier and more costeffective for large companies to acquire names in rightsides portfolio of new gtlds our emphasis on this segment of customer base is starting to produce incremental gains and finally china is our third area of strategic focus i recently returned from a trip to china and we have a lot to share on our efforts in this important region first we started to hire incountry personnel to help us navigate the local market and maximize the relationships weve developed with our many chinese registrar partners second while it continues to take longer than expected we believe we are very close to receiving regulatory approval from the chinese government for our first few new gtlds which should lead to greater distribution and consumption in the back half of this year and lastly in our meetings with key registrars we learned there is a change in focus from driving unit volumes to driving gross margins which should prove beneficial to rightside given our approach to the market on both premium names and higher margin for standard registrations in general our registry business continues to work diligently across our registrar partner base with a number of campaigns aimed at growing the base of registrations across our portfolio with several of our biggest partners we experienced new registration volume gains that we expect will convert into attractive lifetime value from these newly acquired customers shifting gears now to our retail registrar namecom where we directly benefited from vertical integration of this registrar property with our registry platform namecom continues to be a strong performer across the board for rightside new gtlds with cash revenue associated with our registry domains nearly doubling on a yearoveryear basis our profitability initiatives and increasing emphasis on new gtlds and valueadded service offering have helped to improve overall margins for namecom however registration growth rates remain challenged industry wide and namecom revenue growth has been impacted turning now to our aftermarket business we reported better than expected revenues of  million for the quarter as certain third party syndication partners stepped up their activity on our platform further this area our business will continue to be soft compared to last year and is experiences significant fluctuations that are challenging to control and predict before i turn things over to tracy let me update you on the share repurchase program that we announced on last quarters conference call as of last week weve repurchased approximately  of our common stock for  million and we have  million of capacity remaining available under the current plan our strong balance sheet allows us the ability to execute this repurchase program while retaining the flexibility to make appropriate investments and run the business for the long term in summary we are excited about the progress we made this quarter and the opportunities ahead looking into  we will continue to execute on our key strategic initiatives selling premium highasp domain names focusing on toptier brands in our registrar channel and continuing our expansion efforts in china now let me turn it over to tracy to take you through the numbers for q tracy tracy knox thanks taryn ill begin today by providing an overview of our financial results for the first quarter ended march   followed by the key metrics as a reminder all financials will be reported on a continuing operations basis to reflect the recent sale of enom starting with revenue total revenue in the first quarter was  million our registry services revenue increased  to  million in the first quarter as we recognized revenue on a growing base of domains registered on our owned and operated gtlds our registrar services revenue increased to  million on an increasing base of domain registrations as well as a  increase in average revenue per domain as we continue to realize the benefit of our pricing optimization efforts implemented in  and drives an increase in vas attached rates as weve previously communicated we continue to see yearoveryear declines in our aftermarket business related to the lowermargin thirdparty parking syndication business however aftermarket and other revenue of  million were better than the  million to  million we had projected for q as taryn noted earlier this area of our business experiences significant fluctuations that are challenging to control or predict for the first quarter of  cost of revenue decreased to  million gross margin of  improved  basis points over the prior year period as we focused on the growth of our highermargin registry business and benefited from pricing optimizations launched in  looking ahead to the remainder of  we expect further improvements in our gross margins as we continue driving an increasing mix of the highermargin registry services revenue and further benefit from our pricing optimization efforts sales and marketing expenses decreased  in the first quarter to  million as we shifted more of the marketing dollars to channel rebate programs as a reminder these rebates are net against revenue rather than accounted for in sales and marketing expense technology and development expenses in the first quarter decreased  to  million as we benefited from reducing the infrastructure resources and technology costs needed to support our platform general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were flat at  million we remain focused on restructuring our core operations as our tsa with tucows winds down and we expect further savings in the back half of the year total adjusted ebitda from continuing operations for the first quarter was negative  improving from a negative  million in the prior year period now i will move on to our key metrics endofperiod registry domains totaled approximately  up  yearoveryear average registry services revenue per domain was  in the first quarter down  from the prior year the decline in arpd was primarily driven by a decrease in launchrelated revenue and a yearoveryear increase in the use of rebates as opposed to traditional marketing expense the final overall registry renewal rate for the fourth quarter of  was  compared to  for the same quarter in  registry renewal rates are not fully measurable until  days after the end of the quarter however we estimate that the q  renewal rate will be approximately  compared with  in q  as noted last quarter we are focused on building a healthy and high quality registry business but we have and will continue to test different marketing initiatives geared at increasing our year one registration flow these activities have driven down overall renewal rate but we have continued to see strong renewal rates in our year two renewals which are approximately  to date turning to our registrar business endofperiod registrar domains totaled  million up  yearoveryear average registrar services revenue per domain increased to  compared to  primarily due to our profitability initiatives as well as an increase in valueadded services finally the registrar renewal rate for the first quarter was  down from  in q of the prior year as we saw an increasing mix of year  registrations and promotional units which have a lower renewal rate on to liquidity and capital resources as of march   our cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities was approximately  million up from  million as of december   there were a few factors that significantly impacted our cash balance this quarter first we recognized approximately  million of cash from the sale of enom after payment of dealrelated expenses second we fully repaid the  million outstanding on our revolving credit facility and a  million capital lease obligation finally we used  million to buy back stock under our share repurchase program we are reiterating our previously provided guidance and we expect the following total revenue of  million to  million and total adjusted ebitda of around breakeven for the full year with a return to positive adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter in summary we have a strong balance sheet with the ability to execute the stock buyback program we continue to improve our financial profile with expanding margins and a focus on driving growth in our highermargin core registration services and delivering shareholder value that concludes our prepared remarks i will now turn the call back to the operator to take questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of william gibson from roth capital partners your question please william gibson thank you first just a comment you cut out a lot and i missed a lot of the data i think what would be good is if you could put up a transcript of your prepared remarks perhaps on your site itd be good just so everyone would have access to the numbers that aside id love to dig into china would they be buying the same names and i assume its mostly us names or do you have foreign names as well and exactly how does that work taryn jogi naidu yes no appreciate it and definitely well have the transcripts up for your consumption so from the chinese market perspective its a vibrant large market and we see registration patterns in more chinese characters as well as us and english characters as well and so youve just got to remember that that market is enormous and therere a lot of entities out there and individuals that are approaching the global market and so might need more of an english term as well as the ones that are looking domestically at chinese terms william gibson okay no that sounds good and i think you mentioned one premium name you sold that was it sounds like it probably got  videogames what was perhaps another name or two that people picked up at top dollar in the quarter taryn jogi naidu yes we havent broadcasted a lot of the sales however weve seen multiple over  to  figure sales in our registry business we continue to see more and more leads and opportunities coming with the highvalue premium domain names and i think the videogames sale was just the beginning and we do believe that the premium and platinum names will accelerate faster on a revenue perspective than the standard registrations and carry a lot more of  or a disproportionate amount of the revenue in the shorter to midterm operator thank you and this does conclude the questionandanswer session of todays program id like to hand the program back to management and i would just also like to reiterate that we will be posting the prepared remarks on the investor section of the website back to management taryn jogi naidu thank you all for joining the call today and we look forward to keeping you updated on our
