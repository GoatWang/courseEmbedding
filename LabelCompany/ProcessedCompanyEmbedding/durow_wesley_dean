this product started out as our own personal hell it took about  hours to be completely done due to problems we encountered the directions were not always clear some of the pieces had to be oriented based on holes on certain sides of the piece the directions dont mention this and the only way to realize it is to either get farther along and see the mistake or try to find the tiny dot on the picture of that step each step would give you a summary of the parts needed but frequently did not include half of the work to be done on that page based on the directions the ladder must be on the right sidewe got past this by reversing the futon brackets so that the futon would open to the other side then we could turn the bed around and have the ladder on the left side once it was completed we were very happy with the finished product weve tested it with about  lbs on the top bunk without fear over safety this replaced a unit that we didnt feel could safetly handle our  year old son anymore and it does that job we just expected more quality control and service for a bed normally priced at vsmost liked negative review futon is already failingthere is not a center support for the

sacramanto caabout me midrange shopperproscomfortablegood color schemeconsbest usescomments about duro wesley twin over futon bunk bed  silver  besilvkd slti ordered this bed for my thirteen year old daughter because her room is only x and she needed a sitting area the description said that the upper bunk could support up to  pounds so i thought it would be a good choice for an older child when the bed was delivered it had been damaged in transit and had parts falling out of the package so i refused the shipment hayneedle was good about getting it reshipped quickly however it still took another week for the next delivery this second delivery was damaged so badly i told them not to even take it off the truck the box had torn open completely and bed parts were scattered about once again hayneedle was good about getting it reordered and shipped but it took another week for the shipment to arrive this time the package was intact so i accepted the delivery the box is heavy so expect to have some help moving it around it took me about  hours to assemble the bed very few of the parts were actually labeled with the letters described in the instructions but i managed to figure it out anyway i would suggest looking ahead in the instructions if not completely sure about a particular assembly usually that cleared up any ambiguity i didnt have any trouble with stripped screw holes in the frame although i did get one bad nut that would not fit the bolt that i needed it to i found a replacement in the garage so that was not a big deal the futon opens and closes easily and the top bunk is almost  inches deep so it can hold a thick twin mattress with enough rail left over to keep anyone from rolling out the bed looks really nice with a good silver color finish i did have some issues with this bed it does wobble especially with a larger child up top it doesnt feel like it will fall apart or anything like that but it wobbles more than i expected it to i fixed this by bolting  six inch lbrackets from the upper mattress frame to the wall studs on the back side of the bed its rock solid now i also needed the ladder on the left side of the bed instead of the right side i couldnt reverse the futon brackets and turn the bed around like another reviewer had suggested because i needed the ladder in the front on the left side instead i switched the top end rails so that the one the ladder bolts to is now on the left and i drilled two holes in the lower left panel similar to the ones that were drilled for the right side ladder panel and used large machine screws in them to hold the bottom of the ladder in place this worked very well and is also solid another issue is that because of the rail on the end of the bed it is very difficult to get in and out of the bed from the top rung of the ladder it is doable but is not as easy as it should be i cant take the rail out because the top of the ladder bolts to it im not sure how im going to solve that yet in addition the ladder rungs are hard on the feet i got some thick pipe insulation and put that over the ladder and top rail to make things a little easier overall i am happy with this bed and would recommend itprimary usepersonalbottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend of  customers found this review helpfulwas this review helpful yes  no  you may also flag this reviewjun of  customers
