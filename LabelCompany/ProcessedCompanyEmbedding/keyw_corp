and combined company’s revenue and adjusted ebitda guidance for  due to among other things unanticipated circumstances trends or events affecting the combined companys financial performance factors other than those referred to above could also cause keyw’s or sotera’s results to differ materially from expected results  nongaap financial measures this press release contains forward looking estimates of adjusted ebitda including adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda as defined by keyw is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or us gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures in the same manner as we do we prepare adjusted ebitda to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we encourage you to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons we have various nonrecurring transactions or nonoperating transactions and expenses that directly impact our net income adjusted ebitda is intended to approximate the net cash provided by operations by adjusting for nonrecurring or nonoperating items and securities analysts use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies our board of directors and management use adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating performanceto determine a significant portion of managements incentive compensationfor planning purposes including the preparation of our annual operating budget andto evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under gaap some of these limitations are  adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitmentsadjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needsadjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense or interest incomeadjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for income taxesadjusted ebitda does not include noncash expenses related to stock compensationalthough depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements andother companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures differently than we do limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure as used in this press release with respect to estimated adjusted ebitda for sotera and the combined company respectively keyw defines adjusted ebitda as gaap net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization excluding stockbased compensation transaction and integration costs and other adjustments as applicable associated with the proposed transaction reconciliations of estimated adjusted ebitda to gaap net income is not provided because gaap net income generated by the sotera operations for the applicable future period is not accessible or estimable at this time in this regard keyw has not yet completed the necessary valuation of the various assets to be acquired in the proposed acquisition for accounting purposes or an allocation of the purchase price among the various types of assets in addition the final interest and debt expense associated with the transactions contemplated by the commitment letter have not been finalized and are therefore unavailable accordingly the amount of depreciation and amortization interest and debt expense and other factors that will be included in the additional gaap net income assuming the proposed transaction is consummated is not accessible or estimable at this time and is therefore not available without unreasonable effort the amount of such additional resulting depreciation and amortization applicable interest and debt expense and other factors could be significant such that actual gaap net income would vary substantially from the estimated adjusted ebitda included in this presentationcontacts heather williams corporate media relations  communicationskeywcorpcom chris donaghey investor relations  related articles other press
