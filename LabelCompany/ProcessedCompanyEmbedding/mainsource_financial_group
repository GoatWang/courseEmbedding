nonperforming assets of  of total assets jul   pm edt greensburg ind july   prnewswire  archie m brown jr president and chief executive officer of mainsource financial group inc nasdaq msfg announced today the unaudited financial results for the second quarter of   for the three months ended june   the company recorded net income of  million or  per common share compared to net income of  million or  per common share in the second quarter of   during the second quarter of  the company recorded  million of expenses related to the fcb bancorp inc acquisition  in addition the company also recorded  thousand of expenses related to the prepayment of a federal home loan bank borrowing  these two items reduced earnings per share by  see reconciliation of actual to operating earnings on page  of this release  during the second quarter of  the company recorded  million of expenses related to the cheviot financial acquisition which reduced earnings per share by   ceo comments mr brown commented on the companys second quarter performance we had a very good quarter on an operating basis  excluding the nonoperating items mentioned above and the effect of gains in the securities portfolio earnings per share were  an  increase from  a year ago  the addition of fcb bancorp in late april organic loan growth over the past twelve months and a very strong net interest margin were key drivers of our strong earnings performance mr brown continued loan balances were virtually flat on a linked quarter basis as loan activity was softer than expected  we are disappointed that we did not achieve the growth we anticipated  our loan pipelines indicate stronger performance in the second half of  and we are optimistic that we will achieve loan growth during the remainder of the year similar to our historic norm of mid to high single digits on an annualized basis we were very pleased with our loan quality trends for the quarter as nonperforming loans slightly declined and net chargeoffs remained at historic lows mr brown concluded we completed our acquisition of fcb bancorp on april  and converted systems in late june  the transition has gone very well and we are very excited to have a meaningful presence in louisville  we look forward to making a positive impact in the louisville community and bringing additional financial solutions to our new customer base net interest income net interest income was  million for the second quarter of  compared to  million a year ago  the increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in average earning assets as well as an increase in purchase accounting adjustments  average earning assets increased year over year by  million with approximately  million coming from the cheviot acquisition  coming from the fcb bancorp acquisition and  million coming from organic growth  net interest margin on a fullytaxable equivalent basis was  for the second quarter of  an increase of one basis point on a linked quarter basis  overall the accretion of purchase accounting marks added thirteen basis points to the net interest margin for the second quarter of  compared to eleven basis points in the first quarter of   noninterest income the companys noninterest income was  million for the second quarter of  compared to  for the same period a year ago  an increase in interchange income was more than offset by a decrease in other income primarily interest rate swap fees in the commercial banking division   noninterest expense the companys noninterest expense was  million for the second quarter of  compared to  million for the same period in   as previously mentioned the company incurred  million of expenses related to the fcb bancorp acquisition and recorded a  thousand charge related to the prepayment of a federal home loan bank borrowing during the second quarter of   during the second quarter of  the company recorded  million of expenses related to the cheviot financial acquisition  excluding these items expenses would have been  million in the second quarter of  compared to  million for the same period in   the year over year increase in total expenses were primarily in the employee occupancy and equipment expense categories and were primarily related to the acquisition of fcb in april   balance sheet and capital total assets were  billion at june   which represents a  million increase from a year ago  the increase in assets was primarily related to the acquisition of fcb  million and organic loan growth over the past twelve months  excluding the  million of loan balances that were acquired in the fcb acquisition loan balances decreased by  million organically on a linked quarter basis   the decrease in loan balances was primarily driven by weaker than anticipated loan demand in the first half of   the companys regulatory capital ratios remain strong and as of june   were as follows leverage ratio of  tier one capital to riskweighted assets of  common equity tier one capital ratio of  and total capital to riskweighted assets of   in addition as of june   the companys tangible common equity ratio was  compared to  as of march    asset quality nonperforming assets npas were  million as of june   a decrease of  million on a linkedquarter basis  npas represented  of total assets as of june   compared to  as of march   and  as of june    the company incurred net chargeoffs of  thousand and recorded  thousand of loan loss provision expense for the second quarter of   the low level of provision expense was based on the decrease in loan balances during the current quarter and the overall improvement in credit quality  the companys allowance for loan losses as a percent of total outstanding loans was  as of june   compared to  as of march   and  as of june    the decrease in this metric was primarily driven by the increase in acquired loans that were marked to fair value at the acquisition date and not included in the loan loss reserve analysis use of nongaap financial measures this press release includes financial measures prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap specifically we have included nongaap financial measures of the companys earnings per share excluding the impact of costs associated with the acquisitions of fcb bancorp inc and cheviot financial corp and the impact of a prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of a federal home loan bank borrowing and noninterest expense excluding the impact of costs associated with the acquisitions  these nongaap financial measures should be considered supplemental to and not as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap  we believe this information is helpful in understanding the companys results of operations separate and apart from items that may or could have a disproportionate positive or negative impact in any given period such as purchase

second quarter of   during the second quarter of  the company recorded  million of expenses related to the fcb bancorp inc acquisition  in addition the company also recorded  thousand of expenses related to the prepayment of a federal home loan bank borrowing  these two items reduced earnings per share by  see reconciliation of actual to operating earnings on page  of this release  during the second quarter of  the company recorded  million of expenses related to the cheviot financial acquisition which reduced earnings per share by   ceo comments mr brown commented on the companys second quarter performance we had a very good quarter on an operating basis  excluding the nonoperating items mentioned above and the effect of gains in the securities portfolio earnings per share were  an  increase from  a year ago  the addition of fcb bancorp in late april organic loan growth over the past twelve months and a very strong net interest margin were key drivers of our strong earnings performance mr brown continued loan balances were virtually flat on a linked quarter basis as loan activity was softer than expected  we are disappointed that we did not achieve the growth we anticipated  our loan pipelines indicate stronger performance in the second half of  and we are optimistic that we will achieve loan growth during the remainder of the year similar to our historic norm of mid to high single digits on an annualized basis we were very pleased with our loan quality trends for the quarter as nonperforming loans slightly declined and net chargeoffs remained at historic lows mr brown concluded we completed our acquisition of fcb bancorp on april  and converted systems in late june  the transition has gone very well and we are very excited to have a meaningful presence in louisville  we look forward to making a positive impact in the louisville community and bringing additional financial solutions to our new customer base net interest income net interest income was  million for the second quarter of  compared to  million a year ago  the increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in average earning assets as well as an increase in purchase accounting adjustments  average earning assets increased year over year by  million with approximately  million coming from the cheviot acquisition  coming from the fcb bancorp acquisition and  million coming from organic growth  net interest margin on a fullytaxable equivalent basis was  for the second quarter of  an increase of one basis point on a linked quarter basis  overall the accretion of purchase accounting marks added thirteen basis points to the net interest margin for the second quarter of  compared to eleven basis points in the first quarter of   noninterest income the companys noninterest income was  million for the second quarter of  compared to  for the same period a year ago  an increase in interchange income was more than offset by a decrease in other income primarily interest rate swap fees in the commercial banking division   noninterest expense the companys noninterest expense was  million for the second quarter of  compared to  million for the same period in   as previously mentioned the company incurred  million of expenses related to the fcb bancorp acquisition and recorded a  thousand charge related to the prepayment of a federal home loan bank borrowing during the second quarter of   during the second quarter of  the company recorded  million of expenses related to the cheviot financial acquisition  excluding these items expenses would have been  million in the second quarter of  compared to  million for the same period in   the year over year increase in total expenses were primarily in the employee occupancy and equipment expense categories and were primarily related to the acquisition of fcb in april   balance sheet and capital total assets were  billion at june   which represents a  million increase from a year ago  the increase in assets was primarily related to the acquisition of fcb  million and organic loan growth over the past twelve months  excluding the  million of loan balances that were acquired in the fcb acquisition loan balances decreased by  million organically on a linked quarter basis   the decrease in loan balances was primarily driven by weaker than anticipated loan demand in the first half of   the companys regulatory capital ratios remain strong and as of june   were as follows leverage ratio of  tier one capital to riskweighted assets of  common equity tier one capital ratio of  and total capital to riskweighted assets of   in addition as of june   the companys tangible common equity ratio was  compared to  as of march    asset quality nonperforming assets npas were  million as of june   a decrease of  million on a linkedquarter basis  npas represented  of total assets as of june   compared to  as of march   and  as of june    the company incurred net chargeoffs of  thousand and recorded  thousand of loan loss provision expense for the second quarter of   the low level of provision expense was based on the decrease in loan balances during the current quarter and the overall improvement in credit quality  the companys allowance for loan losses as a percent of total outstanding loans was  as of june   compared to  as of march   and  as of june    the decrease in this metric was primarily driven by the increase in acquired loans that were marked to fair value at the acquisition date and not included in the loan loss reserve analysis use of nongaap
