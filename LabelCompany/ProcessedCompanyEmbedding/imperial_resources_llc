billion cubic feet of gas with a productive life of approximately  additional years to be conservative the analysis was performed using july prices assuming a cost of  per barrel of oil and  an mcf for gas over the life of the well with no escalation this means that if the prices rise above those numbers the productive life of the well will be extended   in parallel work has been ongoing with a

prospectus and  per corresponding warrant after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us if all of the warrants issued in this offering are exercised for cash then we will receive an additional  million of proceeds it is possible that the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis or expire prior to being exercised in which case we will not receive any additional proceeds a  increase decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of  per share and accompanying warrant would increase decrease our net proceeds from this

develop our existing assets through our drilling program and to acquire producing assets with development opportunities “new assets” if any new assets are identified that meet our acquisition metrics we may reallocate proceeds from this offering to acquire new assets the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of cash generated by our operations the amount of competition and other operational factors we may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes from time to time we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of resources including the proceeds of this offering is being optimized

of the net proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments including shortterm investment grade interest bearing instruments and us government securities the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies in our industry that have greater resources than we do many of these companies not only explore for and produce natural gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit and may be able to expend greater resources to attract and maintain industry personnel in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in appalachia our main competitors are stedman energy chautauqua energy cotton drilling atlas energy and snyder brothers in midcon our main competitors are white horse resources third oil tex can energy and flying j resources the company’s personnel have excellent reputations have worked for decades in the industry and
