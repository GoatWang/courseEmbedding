condensed by vivian marinoq you wear many hats how do you balance all your responsibilities and interestsa in most of these companies i have very good operating people i’m there to help and try to make them be better at what they doq would you say you focus more on real estate and douglas elliman these days a i think sowe have over  brokers now and  with florida and we just opened california a few weeks ago we signed up a new project with one of the largest chinese development companies called greenland usa they’re developing in downtown los angeles it’s going to be about  to  condos and a hotel so we’re very excited about that advertisement continue reading the main story q what is your main role at elliman and how does it differ from that of dottie herman the chief executive continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story a dottie handles daytoday operations she has a much tougher job than i do she works on all the problems dottie’s a real people personi try to work on all the good things that i enjoy doing i like new development getting involved in new projects recruiting brokers trying to help our brokers make money i know a lot of developers this morning i was out on a new project that we’re going to be doing for a developerq which onea i don’t think he wants to talk about it yetit’s residential in manhattan not far from madison square park it’ll be a hotel and a condo tower there will probably be about  or so units and a nicesize hotel that’s sort of a trend today because hotels are so expensive to build you have to combine them to lower the cost of your hotel by selling condominiums at a profit we’re doing two of those in miamiq what’s your outlook for new york real estate this yeara i’m very bullish i think the city is still going to move forward we have three to five good years coming upq and of new york real estate with mayor bill de blasio who ran under a campaign for more middleincome housing photo credit james estrinthe new york times a what we learned is that what a politician says while he’s campaigning turns out to be somewhat different than what happens afterwardlook i think there’ll be more affordable housing but on the other hand if the land costs and everything are so expensive and you can’t find anyone to build it — developers are in it to make some money — it’s not going to happen so you have to be realistic i think that the push that de blasio was speaking about regarding housing was rental housing making it more affordable on the rental side and not so much on the purchase side advertisement continue reading the main story the city is expensive to live in — it’s not easy to buy an apartment in the cityq how many homes do you own newsletter sign up continue

westchester i have fisher island in florida i have one where i go bird hunting and quail hunting in florida and on nantucket island i like collecting real estateq will you buy in the albany the luxury condominium development planned in the bahamas in which the vector group is a partner with the tavistock groupa i’m going to buy an apartment there probably about  feet — it’s a big threebedroomq new valley realty has partnerships in other developmentsa about seven or eight  madison square  east th street retail at  seventh avenue two small investments with steve witkoff and ian schrager downtown one is going to be condos the other is hotel and condos i have one in queens in a rental building with the property management group  beach street downtown with hfz capitalq what is the status of the albany projecta the whole thing is now about  units i think construction will start in the fall we’re not selling in new york yet because we’re not approved by the attorney general yet i see it as a getaway for new yorkers and floridianswe want to be where the same clients are the same people are and if you look at where we are at douglas elliman — new york city long island the hamptons westchester south florida and los angeles — pretty much it’s the same groupq will elliman be adding any more officesa i think the only other market left most likely is fairfield county greenwich westport we have a westchester presence with a couple of brokers who are licensed to go into connecticut but we will end up having an office in the nottoodistant future in greenwich i would hope we would get it open this yearq so i know you’re a fan of nathan’s famous but do you like its hot dogsa i like to say i’m the official taste tester i love it i’m pretty much standard you know mustard and

insurance marketplace after my insurance company dropped my plan i literally called  different companies and spoke w several different ppl who gave me incorrect or insufficient information finally i ended up using google to do my own research and found the company phone numbers to the individual health insurances offered on the market place i called them all but the only one who seemed interested in helping me was this man named keith from molina healthcare keith sent my info to some brokers in the area that were supposed to get back to me and never did i called keith back a few weeks later to let him know and he was so devastated he said he would make it his first priority to find me a broker who would take the matter seriously the next day he referred two different brokers i called the first one and got an agent named danny delgado i could tell from the first  sentences that he was the first agent ive talked to that is fully knowledgeable on all this new healthcare marketplace stuff he explained in laymens terms all the different health care options and how each differentiated from the others i honestly feel  percent more educated on the subject myself after speaking with him he helped me choose the most appropriate plan for me and was not focused on trying to get me to spend as much as possible in fact he found me the cheapest plan ive seen so far i usually dont go out of my way to write long reviews unless im really disappointed in something i will give credit where it is due and but keith of molina healthcare and danny of super insurance need to be recognized for being  of the few that take their job seriously now adays i applaud you both maria elena cisneros  state farm insurance agentjploving ratedthis state farm office is the this state farm office is the

piccs service i will recommend picc to all my friends and family did you knowinsurance basicsto mitigate the risk of loss people purchase insurance policies from a company when buying a policy the person agrees to pay a premium which is small regular payment based on the losses that may occur if the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy the premium is usually higher premiums are often paid monthly and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured itemmany types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item the amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible in the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what if the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount the insurance company does not pay anything if the cost is greater than the deductible the policyholder only pays the deductible while the insurance pays the rest generally the deductible amount is related to your premium with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium and viceversainsurance agents selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage this is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most based on their needs and individual risk agents can often give potential customers a quote which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy this is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly credit scores play a major role in insurance scores but past insuranceclaim history is also taken into accountwhile agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance some sell several different types of insurance agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently selling policies from several different insurersinsurance productsalmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all useautomotive insurance millions of americans drive a car to get from place to place each day so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types in most states the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car up to a certain amount most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident its important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others not the policyholder themselves in addition to liability insurance car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident for this purpose liability vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policyinsurance can also be purchased for other vehicles like motorcycles atvs boats or rvs and generally functions similarly to car insurance policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles atvs boats and rvshomeowners insurance your home condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for so it makes sense to get it insured homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policylike auto insurance homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items the primary coverage type is for the dwelling insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it policies may also cover property within the home with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for much like auto insuranceproperty insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control these are known as perils and may include fire flooding natural disasters and other catastrophic events you may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a highrisk area flood insurance is an exception however and can be purchased through the governmentsponsored national flood insurance program your lender may require this if you live in a floodprone areahealth insurance to help pay for medical expenses many people rely on their health insurance with the passing of the affordable care act almost every american is required to enroll in a health care plan or they face a penalty health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance although it is probably used to cover expenses more often since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine health insurance also operates on a premiumdeductible model and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle for example if you visit doctors very infrequently you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible on the other hand people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by lawlife insurance when someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost life insurance comes in two basic types term and universal with a term life insurance plan you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time usually  years or more if you die at any point in that timeframe your family receives a death benefit if youre still around when the term is over the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing universal life covers your entire life and usually delivers a minimum benefit at deathtravel insurance travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel whether its losing luggage or medical treatment abroad travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trippet insurance pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog cat or other domestic animal medical care for animals can be very costly particularly because insurance for them is rare by paying into a premium you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication while virtually unheard of a few years ago pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to riseumbrella insurance umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies usually home or auto insurance consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover for example most car insurance liability policies cover at least  per person or  per accident but if the accident involves a very valuable car or the victim is willing to pursue legal action insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost you may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policyinsurance claims basicsto receive a payout for an insurance policy the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company the basics of the process are straightforward but can vary depending on the type of insuranceclaims adjusters and examiners a claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided an adjuster inspects claims related to property damage as in the case of auto or home insurance policies claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedureshow to make a claim filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses its important to note that in the case of emergencies you should always call  first the safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insuranceauto insurance claim if youre involved in an accident you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation you can file a claim upon obtaining the police report its also a good idea if possible to take your own notes at the scene the most important things to record are what happened before the accident the date and time traffic signs in the area and road conditions also be sure to get the other drivers name address license plate number and insurance information even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process once you have this documentation call your insurance company right away homeowners insurance claim in the case of damage take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible if any of your possessions were damaged use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim once an adjuster has made their own report review it for accuracy life insurance claim send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan as well as a certified copy of the policyholders death certificate with the proper information life insurance claims are generally straightforward problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy in this case an attorney may be needed to settle the claimfinding discounts on insuranceinsurance is a wise investment but it can make a dent in your monthly budget thankfully there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you needshop and compare perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible even after youve chosen a plan and started paying into it consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy while traditional agents can still find a good deal independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs the internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before potential customers can often get free quotes online very quicklybuy only what you need insurance agents will often try to upsell on various extra products that may be useful for certain people but are generally excessive for the average consumer stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs for example if the annual cost of your auto insurance is  percent or more of the total value of your car drop all but the most essential coverage this is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings otherwise you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash it can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policytake advantage of discounts insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances in one of the most basic discounts many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home auto and life insurance policies from the same provider car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course for those with teenagers on their plan good grades can earn a small discount as well insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel federal employees teachers first responders and their families we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback howard

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
