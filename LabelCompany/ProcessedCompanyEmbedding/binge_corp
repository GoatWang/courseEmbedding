period of time usually in private and often when they are not even hungry binges are usually planned like a ritual and can involve the person buying “special” binge foods people will often have feelings of guilt and disgust at their lack of control after binge eating unlike those with bulimia sufferers do not purge themselves after a binge in an attempt to control their weight people with
