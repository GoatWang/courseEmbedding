solutions     total revenue       cyber solutions segment revenue for the cs segment for the year ended december   decreased  as compared to the year ended december   the primary reason for the decline in revenue is due to revenue from hardware resales in  in the amount of approximately  which was not repeated during  revenue for this line of business hardware resales is significantly lower in  as compared to  and it is being discontinued the cs segment has operated as an early stage business we believe that the companys products and service offerings represent a disruptive technology and our efforts have been focused on gaining acceptance in the marketplace the company believes that its products and service offerings provide unique and significant benefits over the existing products and while we have expanded our sales efforts and continue to enhance our product offerings no assurance can be given as to if and when our products will receive broad acceptance in the marketplace ipsabusiness advisory solutions segment revenue for the ipsabas segment for the year ended december   increased  as compared to the year ended december   the large increase is due to the acquisition of ipsa on february   revenue for the this segment excluding the contribution of the ipsa acquisition for the year ended december   decreased  as compared to the year ended december   the decline in revenue for the bas segment was mainly due to a significant decline in revenue from four large customers as well as the impact of five projects that were active and completed during  which was not fully offset by revenue from new customers in  our sales efforts have not been effective in replacing revenue reductions from existing customers revenue due to the ipsa acquisition during the year ended december   was  and was entirely incremental the competitive environment has sharpened significantly as more companies have entered this line of business including those who use off shore labor and indirect sourcing and provide services at significantly lower rates the company continues to evaluate its pricing and service delivery processes to respond to this new market condition energy and controls solutions segment revenue for the es segment for the year ended december   decreased  as compared to the year ended december   as a part of the companys shift in strategy and repositioning that was announced in september  the company decided to deemphasize the energy business and as a result the assets of the energy audit business were sold in the first quarter of  this shift in the energy business is and may continue to be a primary reason for the decline in revenue gross margin gross margin revenue less cost of revenues defined as all costs for billable staff for the ipsabas segment and cost of goods for the es and cs segments increased to  for  from  for  an increase of  or  the main reason for the increase in gross margin was the acquisition of ipsa on february   gross margin for  excluding the contribution from the acquisition of ipsa was  a net decrease of  when compared to  gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to  in  from  in  the main reasons for the decreased gross margin are i increased expenditures in revenue related resources and staffing in the cyber solutions segment ii expansion of the cyber proprietary platform which were charged to cost of revenues iii a decrease in gross margin contribution associated with  cs hardware sales not repeated in  and iv energy solutions revenue reductions greater than an associated reduction in cost of revenue expenses on a segment basis the gross margin percentage increased in the bas segment to  in  from  in  decreased in the es segment to  in  from  in  and with the

increased to  in  as compared to  in  sga expenses increased  during  as compared to  and break out as follows cyber segment sga expenses in the cs segment were  in  as compared to  in  an increase of  the increase is primarily due to increased labor costs of approximately  increased travel expense of  increased rent expense of  and increased professional fees of  labor costs and travel expense increased during  as the company continues to invest in and build out cs resources and expertise as the company positions this segment for future growth rent expense increased as the company leased three new officetraining facilities during  and professional fees increased due to higher marketing costs cs expenses as a percentage of segment revenue increased to  in  from  in  ipsabas segment sga expenses in the bas segment increased to  in  as compared to  in  an increase of  or  the increase is attributable to the incremental expenses due to the acquisition of ipsa which were  bas expenses as a percentage of segment revenue increased to  in  from  in  es segment sga expenses in the es segment decreased to  in  as compared to  in  a decrease of  or  the decrease is primarily attributable

expenses as a percentage of segment revenue decreased to  in  from  in  corporate overhead corporate overhead sga expenses increased to  in  from  in  an increase of  or  the main drivers of the increase were increases in professional fees of  and stock option expenses of  those increases were offset by a decrease in labor costs of  the increase in professional fees is primarily due to higher legal and accounting fees as well as increased public relations and advisory fees the increase in stock option expense was primarily due to the increase in the valuations of the options issued in  as compared to those issued in  the decrease in labor costs was primarily due to a reduction in bonus expense for senior executives energy repositioning and subcontract obligation during  the company incurred onetime charges of approximately  related to two items  the repositioning of the company to accentuate an increased focus and commitment to cybersecurity and regulatory risk mitigation and

incurred onetime expenses of  related to the headcount adjustments platte river has alleged that the company signed as a coindemnitor in support of surety bonds issued by platte river on behalf of prime solutions for the benefit of honeywell pursuant to prime solutions incs prime solar project located in worcester massachusetts the prime contract the company filed its answer to the complaint relating to this action denying the allegations of platte river on february   the company received a demand letter from platte river for immediate payment of an  claim under the terms of the coindemnity agreement the company continues to deny the allegations and will not agree to the demand the companys maximum liability exposure under the bond is  if prime fails to meet its contracted obligations in october  the company determined it was probable that prime would fail to meet its contracted obligations under the prime contract and therefore that the potential existed that the company may have to meet outstanding prime contract obligations the company has evaluated the status of the project amounts paid to date on the contract and assessed the remaining work to be performed notwithstanding the demand letter from platte river the company continues to believe its potential obligation under the prime contract is approximately  and that amount was accrued as a selling

was attributable to the es segment after completion of the valuation work of the segment it was determined that the fair value of the goodwill for the es segment was  resulting in a noncash impairment

allocation the company recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately  with a corresponding increase to goodwill for the tax effect of the acquired identifiable intangible assets from ipsa this liability was recorded as there will be no future tax deductions related to the acquired intangibles but they will be amortized as described above for financial reporting purposes prior to the acquisition the company had determined that it was more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets would not be realized and therefore had recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of its deferred tax assets which were  at december   upon the acquisition the company evaluated the likelihood that the acquired deferred tax assets and liabilities would be realized and as a result of that evaluation recorded an increase to the valuation allowance of approximately  related to the acquired deferred tax assets and recorded a reduction to the valuation allowance of
