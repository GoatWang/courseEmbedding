discussion eric k steen chief executive officer of infusystem said in  we were faced with a number of significant challenges that impacted our top and bottomlines for the full year in late april  cms issued ruling se announcing that ambulatory infusion pumps would no longer be reimbursed for medicare patients leaving an outpatient clinic or physician office due to this material change we quickly reengineered our entire business process with medicare patients and we successfully transitioned  of our outpatient infusion clinic customers to a new fee schedule our direct pay method for their medicare patients we accomplished this transition while rolling out our new express it computer system as a result of our actions we believe we are strategically positioned to gain market share going forward fourth quarter financial results and their comparison to prior year reflects the impact of the transition from billing cms to billing the outpatient infusion clinic providers directly however due to market share gains fourth quarter oncology and pain management revenue was up  compared to the third quarter on a sequential basis we can more clearly see the results of our market share gain in fourth quarter by the  year over year increase in our oncology monthly pump rental volume our nonopioid postsurgical pain management service continues to grow continued mr steen at year end this business was on a runrate to serve  patients annually and generate approximately  million dollars in net revenue several new clients have already implemented in  and these numbers are moving up and to the right we will soon be launching our previously developed block pain dashboard application for mobile phones we expect this feature to further accelerate the growth of this business in the coming years mr steen concluded we enter  with the largest market share in the history of infusystem we recently completed a reengineering and streamlining of our internal operations to increase efficiencies and reduce our annual payroll by more than  million our plan for  is to focus on leveraging the investments made in the growing the infusion market limit our capital
