go to farmers’ markets fresh nation llc wants to make the shopping trip an online experience for consumers fresh nation llc delivers the produce of farmers’ markets to customers’ doors said tony lee founder of the stamford connbased company that began in  lee came out of the technology world and was set on the idea of opening his own farmers’ market “i wanted a complete break from technology so we opened a smaller farmers’ market on the grounds of the danbury fair mall in danbury conn lee had worked in technology and ecommerce for about  years previous to that “at that point i didn’t have a thought in my mind about the application of technology to farmers’ markets but at the end of that first year i just decided that the world didn’t need any more farmers’ markets it needed better farmers markets” he said lee said fresh nation has built the largest database of farmers’ market vendors in the us fresh nation now has information on  markets and vendors and is beginning to exchange that information with publishers whose readers want to know about where their local farmers’ markets are after compiling the database fresh nation began to digitize the farmers’ market experience so consumers could pick the foods they want from a farmers’ market and place it in a virtual basket online fresh nation sends its shoppers to the farmers’ markets collects the produce and delivers it to customers lee said “you can get freshpicked fruits delivered to your home from the farmers’ markets every day” lee said currently fresh nation operates in fairfield county conn and will expand to orange county calif by about may he said “we’re expanding into new york on the east coast and on the west coast in orange county california at the end of the summer lee said he expects the company will have  to  delivery areas fresh nation appeals to consumers who don’t typically go to farmers’ markets he said “they are the people who want to eat fresh local food who don’t go to farmers’s markets” he said fresh nation doesn’t subtract from traffic at farmers’ markets he said “if you are the type of person who typically goes to the farmers’ market you will continue to go to that farmers’ market” he said many consumers can’t make it to a farmers’ market because of their schedule or because of the operating hours of the market he said “the number of people who want to eat fresh local produce is very large it is just that they are not given the ability to get it so those people become our customers” he said vendors who work with fresh nation benefit from additional business apart from their normal traffic at the farmers’ market he said “they double their sales and get to the market already having sold a lot of food for that day” lee said fresh nation makes money through a  delivery charge and commissions on the food they sell from the vendor he said the company’s expansion has been funded by a group of investors lee said “our goal is to create a brand out of fresh nation so that when you see fresh local food anywhere in the country your automatic reaction is to reach out to fresh nation” he said no comments log in to comment div  copyright  farm journal inc all
