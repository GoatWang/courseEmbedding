state university of new yorjk        piercing the veil comparing science and mysticism as ways of knowing reality   this book explores an area in the field of science and religion that scholars usually neglect  science and mysticism  it examines the recent efforts of popularizers and scholars who see a convergence of modern science and various asian schools of mysticism  in particular madhyamaka buddhism and advaita vedanta  the works examined include the dalai lamas the universe in a single atom the conver gence of science and spirituality the essays in b alan wallaces buddhism and science breaking new ground the physicist victor mansfields tibetan buddhism  modern physics toward a union of love and knowledge and fritjof capras best seller the tao of physics  the entire new age idea of any quantum mysticism is shown to be groundless in part i the distinctions that any comparative study of science and mysticism should recognize are outlined  philosophical problems arising in comparing science and mysticism as ways of knowing reality are highlighted here including issues surrounding the neurological study of meditators by such scientists as eugene g daquili andrew b newberg and mario beauregard  other topics such as what role mysticism may have played in the history of science are also discussed in part ii the efforts of those who see convergences or parallels between modern science and asian mysticism are examined in part iii central questions in the philosophy of religion related to mysticism are addressed and a way that science and mysticism can be positively related is set forth                                                         science and mysticism a comparative study of western natural science theravada buddhism and advaita vedanta    do modern science and traditional mysticism have anything in common can they be related at all how do scientific and mystical claims about reality compare and contrast with each other this philosophical work attempts to provide some answers to these questions part i sets out those aspects of science and mysticism that become important when the two endeavors are compared for science problems concerning understanding concepts laws and theories explanations models observations the acceptance of theories theorychange the accuracy of scientific claims are discussed for mysticism religious ways of life mysticism itself and two types of mystical theories are distinguished theravada buddhism is utilized to illustrate naturemysticism mystical ways of life in which central importance is given to experiences involving a weakening of the ordinary sense of self and the conceptual structuring of experiences in general advaita vedanta is chosen as the example of depthmysticism mystical ways of life giving central importance to allegedly cognitive experiences void of all conceptual and sensory contentpart ii contains comparisons of the nature of scientific and mystical claims first the basic aims of each endeavor and the general relation of knowledgeclaims to cultural phenomena are discussed next under the heading of reality a brief discussion of metaphysics is given before specific comparisons are made on the subjects of time space and orderliness a discussion of the nature of what is taken to be knowledge in science and in mysticism is followed by a discussion of experiences in both enterprises finally the role of language in each is analyzed among the topics considered are paradox and metaphoric utterancespart iii compares and contrasts certain scientific and mystical claims first of all possible relationships between science and mystical claims are set forth with special attention to convergence on abstract levels complementary ways of knowing and the general mystical judgment of the status of scientific claims this is followed by comparisons of specific theories from cosmology and contemporary physics including one technological advance holography with theories of traditional buddhism and advaita vedanta in the case of physics the topics discussed are fields and mystical oneness substance and voidness interconnections and conditionality and the submicroscopic versus macroscopic realms the views of such thinkers as f s c northrop fritjof capra and gary zukav are also discussed finally a reconciliation of mystical and scientific claims is proposed — a position that attributes reality both to being and to the structures in the realm of change with mysticism being authoritative for the former and science for the latteran appendix discussing philosophical implications of scientific neurophysiological studies of mystics and meditators is also included

the philosophers disease reinstating mystery in the heart of philosophy   this work is a philosophical examination of the mysteries surrounding the foundations of science philosophy and religionmuch of western philosophy and science is discussed in order to see our epistemological and metaphysical situation the lovehate relation philosophers have with mystery is explored as are the contributions of reductionists and antireductionists postmodern relativists and critical realists naturalists and the religious and theologians and mystics the thrust of the arguments affirms that there are limits to what philosophy science religion and mystical experiences can tell us about reality by acknowledging that some questions may be unanswerable and understanding the importance of that fact even as the answers remain ambiguous our true situation in the world is revealed mystery should be reinstated as a basic feature when we reflect upon the nature of what we know and who we are mystery frames all of our claims to fundamental knowledge and we must accept that it will remain a permanent fixture thus the importance of mystery needs to be reaffirmed today during an era when the fullness of reality is often ignored                                                                                                                                                           for the glory of god the role of christianity in the rise and development of modern science volume      this book presents arguments concerning the positive and negative roles christian doctrines have played in the rise and development of modern science  philosophers and scientists have written numerous books about how creationism and intelligent design are not part of science but they have ignored two more encompassing historical and philosophical issues underlying the conservative theists attack on science first conservative christian scholars commonly claim that christian theological doctrines are the source of modern science to them modern science is the step child of medieval christian theology or early protestant doctrines that is without those theological beliefs as presuppositions modern science could never have arisen and christianity or at least theism is the only possible source of these beliefs moreover they argue that even today to practice science all scientists must be committed to these theistic or specially christian ideas whether they realize it or not this dependency thesis has become widely accepted even outside conservative circles such scientists as edward o wilson and paul davies in their writings for the general public accept the historical part of this thesis as a givensecond some conservative christians argue that theology has the epistemic right to control the content of all scientific theories and indeed the very nature of science to them science unfettered from theological control cannot reveal all of the true nature of the universe and so theology must control the content and methods of all science in the words of the philosopher alvin plantinga scripture can correct science these christians in fact advocate religious control beliefs not only over science but over all thoughtboth the dependency thesis and the control belief thesis are challenged here first the dependency thesis is presented and the historical and philosophical case against it is laid out next an argument for why modern science arose in the west and not in some other culture is presented the negative effect of control beliefs on science is then presented followed by a more general discussion science and religion                                                                                                                                                           for the glory of god the role of christianity in the rise and development of modern science volume     this volume backs up the positions taken in volume  by presenting a history of the role of christian ideas in the physical and biological sciences from the middle ages to today it reveals the failure of the popular “war” and “harmony” models for the relation of religion and science and shows that a “control” model explains the complex history of the relation of religion and science                                                                                                                                             one nation under god new grounds for accepting the constitutionality of government references to god   a firestorm of controversy developed when michael newdow challenged the constitutionality of the phrase “under god” in the pledge of allegiance in order to understand the legal issues and the public reaction one nation under god explores the history of the government’s references to god in our national motto on coins and in other governmental announcements along with a history of the pledge of allegiance the book discusses the setting of american “civil religion” and other aspects of american culture and then delves into the background of the constitution and the supreme court’s establishment clause rulings needed to understand the courts’ rulings on such governmental uses of “god” state and federal cases on “in god we trust” and “under god” in the pledge of allegiance and other references to god are also explored finally a new rationale for accepting these pronouncements as constitutional is presented                                                                                                                                                                                          analysis and the fullness of reality an introduction to reductionism and emergence   is the world nothing but matter pushing matter in a void are humans nothing but soulless machines for the survival of genes is the mind nothing but the brain is all science reducible to physics must scientists restrict the substance and structure of reality to physical forces does society consist merely of individuals or are holistic forces also at work is god really no more than a projection of nature society or our psyche or in each case do new realities emerge that cannot be reduced virtually every scholarly and popular book and magazine article on the mind science or religion touches on these issues of reductionism but for all the interest in the topic no indepth introduction of the subject exists the objective of this philosophical work is to fill that void    this book attempts to provide one common framework for studying how the issue of reduction versus emergence arises in each of the areas in which it comes up — the natural sciences philosophy of mind the social sciences and religion it tries to resolve some of the disputes by a new analysis differentiating five types of reductionism and antireductionism — ontological structural theoretical conceptual and methodological to help clarify the issues a brief history of how reductionism and emergentism have developed in western philosophy is also presented by distinguishing different types of reductionism and by examining the issues in all the areas of philosophical interest collectively rather than limiting the discussion to just one area the general issues surrounding reduction versus emergence become clearer this approach brings together many of the most interesting questions today in philosophy science and religious studies       early indian philosophy  selections of the vedas and the upanishads translated into plain english with notes and essaysindia has “philosophy” in the western sense of the term and it began early this book deals with the roots of that philosophical thought included here are plain english translations with notes of selections of the rig veda the atharva veda and especially the classic upanishads    also included are five essays to help understand this philosophical reflection these essays are on the sources of indian philosophy knowledge metaphysics and ethics with a specialized essay on “unknowing” in the isha upanishad also included                         early advaita vedanta philosophy volume the gaudapadakarikas is the earliest extant advaita vedanta text it is only explicitly advaita text deemed worth saving from before shankara’s time its philosophical doctrines makes it worthy of study in its own right and sets the stage for shankara’s slightly different advaita     the text is presented here in a plain english translation with notes along with a translation of the mandukya upanishad and shankaras commentaries on both texts also included are an essay on early vedanta who the authors of this text may be and the influence of buddhism on the text especially nagarjuna’s madhyamaka tradition an account of the basic doctrines an essay on shankaras understanding of the gaudapakarikas and a philosophical critique of those doctrinesthis books makes the claim intelligible that all is consciousness one and unchanging and thereby removes much of the shock of gaudapada’s advaita vedanta but it also raises problems with the plausibility of the claim ﻿time travel and harry potter
