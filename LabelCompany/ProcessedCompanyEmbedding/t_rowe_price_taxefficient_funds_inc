information dividend distributions prepare your taxes learn more about taxes tools  resources investors who are interested in maximizing the aftertax returns of their mutual fund holdings may consider investing in a taxefficient fund taxefficient funds seek to achieve longterm capital appreciation while limiting taxable distributions of capital gains and dividends this approach attempts to reduce the effects of federal taxation on an investors longterm return potential and increase aftertax return compared with similar funds for which tax efficiency is not a primary goal the taxefficient equity fund which t rowe price introduced in  seeks to maximize longterm capital growth on an aftertax basis the fund typically invests in stocks of largecap and midcap companies and also may invest a significant portion of its assets in technology companies the funds goal is to generate competitive pretax performance and outperform on an aftertax basis over a full market cycle in an effort to achieve strong aftertax returns the fund seeks to avoid realizing capital gain distributions by limiting sales of existing holdings and not rotating from one sector to another in an attempt to capture shortterm outperformance however taxable gains may be realized in order to satisfy redemption requests or when we believe the benefits of continuing to hold a security outweighs tax considerations as appropriate we may attempt to use losses from sales of securities that have declined to offset future gains that would otherwise be taxable fund holdings are subject to market risk and share prices may be more volatile than those of a fund focusing on slowergrowing or cyclical companies open an account transactions my accounts help center download a prospectus glossary looking for an investment

other hand growthoriented sectors such as information technology health care and consumer discretionary lagged regardless of the markets initial reaction its too soon to definitively declare winners and losers as such we remain steadfast in our bottomup approach to stock selection based on rigorous fundamental research sentiment can certainly be a powerful force in the near term however over the long run returns in the stock market are driven by growth in earnings and cash flows despite recent lackluster returns fundamentals in information technology consumer discretionary and several health care names are actually quite vibrantinformation technologyin the information technology sector we continue to emphasize disruptive business models and technologies that that we believe can sustain high growth for several years secular demand for public cloud computing services remains a key growth driver select companies benefiting from the shift of advertising spending to digital and social media channels also present compelling investment opportunities we also favor companies driven by the convergence of communications and computing including internet software companies and those that

company of taco bell kfc and pizza hut spun off its china business during the period following the spinoff we bought shares of the legacy enterprise we are positive on the companys refranchising initiatives which we believe can lead to higher margins a more stable cash flow stream and more capital being returned to shareholderswe sold shares of hanesbrands during the quarter on concerns that the vertically integrated and owned supply chain model is becoming increasingly less efficient with more acquisitions we also believe the company is exposed to negative tax reform optionality thus we redeployed the proceeds of the sale to fund investments with stronger upside potentialhealth carewe are taking a more cautious approach given the real risk of regulatory reform for the health care sector particularly on drug pricing while weve reduced our exposure to the sector we still believe there are opportunities in select therapeutics companies developing promising drugs that address
