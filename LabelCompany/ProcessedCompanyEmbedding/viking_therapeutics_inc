plan to avoid this ipoviking therapeutics inc nasdaqvktx a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical firm developing treatments for metabolic and endocrine disorders plans to raise  million in its upcoming ipo the san diego californiabased firm will offer  million shares at an expected price range of  per share if the ipo finds the midpoint of that range at  per share vktx will command a market value of  million vktx filed on july   lead underwriters oppenheimer and co inc roth capital partners inc underwriters craighallum capital group llc mlv  co llc summer street research partners summary development of therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders vktx is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical firm seeking to develop therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders the firm currently has a portfolio of five drug candidates in clinical or preclinical trials the most advanced of which is vk which is entering a phase b clinical trial for type  diabetes scheduled to commence in early  and to be completed in  vk helps to regulate blood glucose levels in diabetes patients by inhibiting an enzyme involved in the bodys synthesis of glucose vktxs portfolio also includes treatments targeting cancer cachexia dyslipedmia obesity dyslipidemia and anemia of these treatments only vk for cancer cachexia has begun clinical trials source vktxs drug candidates are based on small molecules licensed from ligand pharmaceuticals ligand plans to purchase approximately  million in vktx share in the upcoming ipo president and ceo brian lian phd has served in his current roles and as a director of vktx since its  inception he previously served as managing director and senior research analyst at suntrust robinson humphrey and as managing director and senior research analyst at global hunter securities he also worked as senior healthcare analyst at the agave group llc and an executive director and senior biotechnology analyst at cibc world markets he also has performed scientific research with amgen and microcide pharmaceuticals dr lian received an mba in accounting and finance from indiana university an ms and phd in organic chemistry from the university of michigan and a ba in chemistry from whitman college potential competition from merck jj eli lilly and others if vktxs product candidates receive regulatory approval they will face competition both from currently marketed treatments for similar indications and from advanced treatments currently in clinical and preclinical development some of these competing products are marketed by firms with significantly greater financial or technical capacities than vktx such as merck  co nysemrk johnson  johnson nysejnj eli lilly and company nyselly takeda pharmaceutical company and morphosys ag valuation vktx offers the following figures in its s balance sheet for the six months ended june   revenue  net loss  total assets  total liabilities  stockholders equity  vktxs current lack of revenues is not unusual in a precommercial biopharmaceutical firm and should not be taken as an indication of the firms potential for future success the firm will not be able to generate substantial revenues until one or more of its candidates have received regulatory approval and have been successfully commercialized conclusion steer clear we plan to avoid this ipo though vktx does have a broad portfolio of product candidates none of them are any where near the point of commercialization even if the firms lead product candidate did receive regulatory approval it would face significant competition both from current treatments for diabetes and potentially from the numerous other products being developed for diabetes vktx would likely struggle to effectively market its products against the likes of johnson

overview and profile diacylglycerol acyl transferase dgat is a key enzyme involved in the formation of triglycerides and is highly expressed in human fat metabolism sites such as intestine liver and adipose dietary triglycerides cannot be absorbed directly in the gastrointestinal or gi tract and are broken down into free fatty acids and monoglycerol in the intestine by pancreatic lipase once absorbed the free fatty acids and glycerol are reassembled into triglycerides at the site of absorption called an enterocyte and packaged into chylomicron particles to be transported in the lymphatic system to be used throughout the body dgat is one of two enzymes that catalyze the steps of triglyceride biosynthesis from mono or diacylglycerol and fatty acids and is mainly distributed in the intestine liver and adipose tissue   dgat mediates absorption of fats from the gi tract inhibition of dgat in the enterocyte reduces postprandial fat deposition increases nutrient sensing satiety inhibition of the enzyme has shown to reduce fat storage in animal models and clinical trials leading to reduction of body weight however nonselective systemic reduction of fat formation can lead to undesirable side effects demonstrated in dgat null mice by introducing a unique chemical function group into the dgat inhibitors viking is developing a series of lead compounds that selectively inhibited dgat at enterocytes the intestinal absorptive cells responsible for the absorption of dietary fat and that demonstrated efficacy in animal models of dietary induced obesity   microsoft
