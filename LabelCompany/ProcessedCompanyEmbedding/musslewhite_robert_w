of the financials then i will close with a few final thoughts as always we will be happy to take questions at the end of the calllet me start with an overview of our financial results adjusted revenue for the quarter ended march   increased  to  million from  million in the comparable quarter of the prior year adjusted ebitda for the quarter ended march   was  million up from  million for the quarter ended march   adjusted net income for the quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share for the quarter ended march   overall our financial performance is on plan for the yearin terms of our annual metrics we achieved an overall member renewal rate of  for the year ended march   our highest ever companywide renewal rate the importance of strong performance on this metric cannot be underestimated it demonstrates an increasing level of member trust in our partnership member value in return on investment received through their work with us and overall product performance and quality a robust year of renewals reflects the very strong position we have with our members and affords us the right to help them solve more of their problems and expand our relationship with them a virtuous cycle that powers the continued expansion of our businessas ive discussed in the past these foundational multiyear member connections underpin our growth strategy of forging deeper more comprehensive member relationships and expanding both our work with and our value delivered to these members our decades worth of renewal rates between  and  is a strong validation of this strategic direction and when our outstanding renewals are combined with the other attributes of our membership model the high proportion of recurring revenues and our scalable business model the result is exception consistency visibility and predictability in the businessrelated to the strong renewals as of the close of the first quarter our membership base grew to  members up from  institutions at the same time last year we are pleased that our membership continues to grow as we extend into additional healthcare relationships and build out our footprint in education penetrating our markets more deeply creates an evenlarger network which in itself is a benefit to our members and it serves as a platform for future expansion as we migrate the relationships to larger and deeper partnerships most importantly a larger base allows us to drive even more improvements and better outcomes across the two important industries we servei received one very striking email last week that gives a sense of the kind of value we are providing one of our dedicated advisors shawn  hit a really exciting milestone he works in our payment integrity performance program helping members use our software to drive revenue recovery effortsin our work with our members we have a structured process where we review program results with each member institutions executive team ensuring that we and the member are on the same page about the value delivered last week shawn  had three of these conversations and the members confirmed that they collectively have received a total of  million in roi through the revenue integrity performance program needless to say it was a great week for shawn beyond the incredible value they received whats exciting is that each of those members will not only be highly likely to renew their relationship with us on this program but they now are also more likely to seek our support in driving value on a broader set of problems through research consulting and additional technology the initial relationship and value delivered sets us up in a position to be the members partner of choice and reinforces for the member that we can drive substantial value to them in key problem areasof course we need to execute to tee up those opportunities appropriately and ultimately sign on the members to additional programs and larger relationships but that is the thrust of our strategy which we have been discussing with you over the past couple of yearsin our last call we discussed our growth outlook for this year and i outlined the key items we are focusing on in order to address the elements that can inflect our growth while we are early into the work things are going according to plan and i wanted to give you updates on

robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co thank you robert i will start with a brief summary of our first quarter financial performance as well as a review of some of our annual metrics for the company and follow that with updates on our health care and education businesses i will then turn it over to michael to provide more detail on our financial performance and financial outlook for  before we open the lines for your questions as you know we announced in february that our board of directors is exploring and evaluating a range of potential strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value this review is ongoing and we do not intend to comment further on the boards process until it concludes our leadership team remains focused on our business and continuing to deliver outstanding service and value to our members turning to an overview of our recent performance we delivered solid overall first quarter results to start the year both adjusted revenue and adjusted ebitda came in above the guidance ranges we provided in late february as expected education revenue grew rapidly while health care revenue slightly declined contract value for the company increased  from a year ago with similar dynamics across the education and health care businesses on the new sales front with the caveat that our first quarter is always our smallest sales quarter we have seen good pacing through april with solid improvement versus the same period in  as anticipated given member demand the mix of health care sales continues to lean towards consulting we would expect this mix to shift back toward technology across the latter part of  and into  as the impact of our new commercial model takes effect so overall we are on track with where we expected to be at this point in the year in terms of the annual business metrics we are pleased to see another very good year of renewal rates which reflects both the exceptional work by our team and the outstanding value we continue to deliver to our members we achieved an overall member renewal rate of  for the last  months while this was down from our historical high of  last year the difference was driven by a lower renewal rate for our international hospitals our health care renewal rate was also  and rises to approximately  if you exclude our roughly  international members with us hospitals renewing at  consistent with the prior year our education member renewal rate remained steady at  this strong customer loyalty is made possible by our products and service quality the impacts we have on our members performance and the high level of member trust in our ongoing partnerships especially in these times of market uncertainty further it is a critical factor in our business model supporting scalable high recurring revenue structure and setting the foundation for a robust future growth of course we are not only continuing and building relationships with existing customers but establishing new relationships as well and our total member count is up  organizations and now stands at  this was primarily driven by  growth in our number of education organizations bringing our total education member count to above  this market penetration is creating an even larger network of forwardthinking institutions engaging with us on the critical issues in education and forming our best practice research and bolstering our product development efforts our health care members are up  and we serve approximately  us hospitals  international hospitals and  nonprovider health care organizations turning now to our markets in health care the political landscape remains uncertain particularly the future of any possible repeal or replacement of the affordable care act given this landscape it remains vitally important for providers to continue to build out their networks reduce clinical variation and improve financial performance all of which are no regret strategies under any potential future reform scenario times of uncertainty like these highlight the fact that our access and continuous insight into industry executives thinking is a unique highly valuable market advantage our membership includes all of the largest and most progressive hospitals and health systems in the united states and our most recent member survey of csuite executives across the country found that their top areas of interest continue to align directly with our three health care focus areas we outlined in january health system growth revenue cycle optimization and care variation reduction first in the survey health system executives acknowledged the need to improve ambulatory access and boost outpatient procedural market share these concerns align with our strategy to drive health system growth by helping members to attract retain and engage patients in an optimal care delivery network second our survey members also highlighted the need to employ innovative approaches to improve financial performance and reduce expense which matches well with our revenue cycle optimization strategy our breadth of revenue cycle technology and consulting capabilities helps to ensure our members are fully paid for services rendered so they have the financial stability to deliver highquality care and enhanced services to their communities third minimizing unwarranted clinical variation and controlling avoidable utilization also scored high marks in the survey were actively working with members to help produce care variation through the implementation of best practice protocols and the delivery of costeffective highquality care were doing some outstanding work in this area particularly around ehr optimization where we have found the combination of technology and consulting to be especially effective here our clinical and it experts focus on three work streams securing accurate clinical documentation to capture patient complexity helping clinicians to make the right care decisions in realtime while presenting the most relevant information at the point of care and streamlining clinical workflows to enhance reliability and efficiency these capabilities need to be hardwired directly into the ehr in order to meaningfully reduce care variation and engage physicians in addition for providers taking on risk these initiatives create greater standardization around best practice protocols which can positively impact financial outcomes further the capture of good data on these efforts can inform future riskbased contract negotiations in one member example a multihospital system our team took a phased approach the work started with an initial focus on improving the systems capture of special coding for patients with chronic conditions this effort allowed the system to better assess patient risk and drive accurate riskadjusted reimbursement the project then built on that initial success by kicking off an annual wellness visit initiative to activate patients in the community these two phases built a solid foundation of physician support which was invaluable in the projects third phase where we rolled out clinical decision support the results speak for themselves the health system realized  million in incremental revenue within the first  weeks and they project nearly  million in annual cost savings from our clinical decision support solution we were able to deliver this roi through our distinct combination of technology and onsite clinical consulting expertise together they marry accurate analytics with best practices to align physicians throughout our members care delivery network and to drive significant benefits moving to our education business this market has no shortage of complex issues either including revenue challenges driven by declines in state funding and stagnant enrollments as well as an increasing focus on value and outcomes by the press consumers and multiple government entities it is more important than ever for colleges to attract and enroll the right students retain more of the students they enroll and guide them successfully toward graduation this type of complexity is the ideal market environment for us through the breadth of eabs member network and the depth of our expertise we find and forge best practices to solve pervasive education industry and member challenges our research teaches our members the strategies that are proven to deliver improved outcomes and tangible value we then help members hardwire these best practices by applying our extensive data assets software capabilities and dataenabled services to produce results for our members in areas like enrollment student success academic performance and advancement all parts of eab continue to perform very well the overall business continues to grow its top line at a midteens plus rate with each individual product area within eab growing midteens or higher renewing at very high levels and delivering outstanding impact to members in addition to strong performance within each of our education business lines the breadth of eabs capabilities pays significant dividends for our members a midwestern university recently asked us to present holistically on all we are doing with them and the synergies among the various eab projects our team presented to the universitys chancellor along with several vice chancellors deans associate deans and directors we explained how our work is centered on best practice insight and focused on helping the member hardwire and implement those best practices specifically we discussed how they can leverage data from our enrollment work to have a better understanding of their students on day one and feed that data into our student success collaborative to achieve even higher graduation rates we also talked about how multiple of our best practice research programs provided insights and tactics to enhance the value of the data and technology applications they were using after this discussion one vice chancellor called their partnership with eab an ecological approach to student success and went on to say the array of eab data and initiatives have helped us prove and disprove assumptions about barriers to student success it was so exciting for our team to hear validation directly from the member about the unique portfolio we bring to bear on their key issues it is also incredibly motivating for our team to see work that we are doing with an institution lay the groundwork for expanded relationships and we had a recent example of this as well this example has to do with guided pathways a key area of focus particularly for community college members whose students often spend more time and money in college than needed because they have not planned their academic path the average community college student earns more than  excess credits pursuing a  credit associate degree and nationally  billion a year is spent by students for courses that do not count toward their degree were working with our members to address this problem eab navigate is a guided pathways technology that includes access to regional job data to help students choose a program of study that prepares them for a career it then helps students create a course schedule that takes into account their study habits outside work personal commitments and ambitions over the last couple of years weve worked with three virginia community colleges focusing on helping students make informed class registration decisions before orientation incorporating career outlook into these decisions to productively engage atrisk students and help reduce the number of dropouts because of our impact on these three campuses eab navigate was recently chosen by the virginia community college system to provide individualized academic planning technology for its  students the decision was gratifying not only because of our initial work with three campuses set the stage for our expanded relationship but also because of the tremendous community impact that our work will have across our education business we continue to invest in new ways to deliver value to our members we see many avenues for future growth and are confident in the continued strong financial profile of this business with that ill turn things over to michael michael t kirshbaum  the advisory board co thanks robert today ill cover highlights of our first quarter financial results the summary of our cash flow and balance sheet as well as a review of our financial outlook for  please refer to todays press release and slide presentation to review our financial and nongaap reconciliation schedules as a supplement to my comments these can be found in the investor relations section of our website advisoryboardcompanycom a quick review of our first quarter top line results shows adjusted revenue for the quarter of  million approximately  million above our previous guidance range and down  from last years first quarter as expected our education business grew approximately  and comprised  of our total revenue in the first quarter health care revenue was down  excluding exited programs compared to a strong quarter last year primarily as a result of slower technology sales at the end of  one note on revenue this years q revenue from exited programs ie the difference between our gaap and adjusted revenue was lower than last years run rate as we now anticipate transitioning members off these programs more quickly contract value of  million increased  over q of last year after adjusting both periods for exited programs with a  decline in health care offset by  growth in education contract value growth was driven by strong sales across all of our education offerings and in health care from our emr optimization work cost and revenue cycle consulting and planning  as well as supported by continued strength in renewals across all of our offerings our contract value per member similarly reflects our revenue and member growth trends overall contract value per member declined  from the same period last year our education contract value per member was flat yearoveryear as both contract value and the number of education members grew significantly health care contract value per member declined about  as overall contract value declined on a slightly growing health care member base adjusted ebitda in the first quarter was  million  million ahead of our previous guidance but down  from q last year as expected due primarily to lower revenue this quarter versus q last year interest expense was  million in the first quarter a  decrease from a year ago as we continued to reduce our debt balance our gaap tax rate was  in the first quarter and was atypically low due to the fact that we were in a tax loss position and in addition now have fluctuations from new accounting rules from equity compensation where differences between realized value and recognized compensation expense from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting now flow through our tax rate for the year we still expect a tax rate of  to  q  nongaap adjusted eps of  was up  from the year ago first quarter as both quarters benefited from lower interest expense and share count from our focused capital allocation strategy page  highlights our cash flow improvement in the first quarter for the quarter cash flow from operating activities increased  to  million capital expenditures decreased  to  million from  million last year and as a result free cash flow improved  over last year during the quarter we incurred cash cost of approximately  million from our health care business restructuring and related severance expenses which is included in cash flow from operations so our cash flow from continuing operations was even stronger our debt balance as of march   was  million which is approximately  times our last  months adjusted ebitda net of the  million cash we currently have on the balance sheet our net debt to ebitda ratio is approximately two times which is more than half a turn lower than our net leverage ratio a year ago for yearend  we continue to target a gross leverage ratio of less than  times trailing adjusted ebitda during the first quarter we sold approximately  of our equity holdings in evolent health for  million in cash proceeds evolent also executed green shoot  april and we sold shares valued at an additional  million that will show up in our q financials while not visible on our balance sheet the gross value of our remaining investment in evolent as of march  was worth over  million based on evolents closing stock price yesterday page  shows our detailed financial guidance for  which remains unchanged from february please note that these numbers exclude exited programs and restructuring costs for the second quarter quarter ending june   we expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda to be in a range of  million to  million as we mentioned in late february based on our visibility into revenue pacing we expect revenue and adjusted ebitda to be relatively back weighted on the year based on how we finished sales in  our ramp of new sales in  the expected timing of consulting delivery and typical seasonality in our enrollment business now ill turn it back over to robert for closing comments robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co thank you michael the advisory board company continues to be very wellpositioned in two high demand target markets with a distinct set of research technology and services capabilities that drive significant member roi we have a powerful economic model that includes very high renewal rates and scalable programs that consistently deliver solid financial performance as we move through  we anticipate continued growth margin expansion and improving cash flow performance across both health care and education we have tremendous opportunities for expansion these are huge markets experiencing a great deal of change in complexity and it is exactly in these times when members need what we do more than ever while shortterm we continue to experience a tougher selling environment in health care particularly for technology we have made what i believe are the right changes in investments both to capitalize on the current market and to position ourselves for future success as the market evolves just as in  when we came out of a tougher sales environment with our most rapid period of growth ever today i see many exciting opportunities that will fuel our future expansion and we continue to invest behind those knowing that members will need our support and help start to this year has been very busy particularly in the health care business with our employees adjusting to our restructuring and our members adjusting to the slimming of our portfolio im tremendously proud of how everyone here has stepped up and thrown themselves into the tasks at hand our solid start to the year is a reflection of how much our employees live out our mission and want to make meaningful impact in health care and education and how they bring that ethic to their work with members im very grateful with that let me hand it over to robert robert p borchert  the advisory board co thank you and just to reiterate roberts earlier statement we do not intend to comment further on our boards strategic review process so we ask that you please limit your questions to our business performance and outlook and the market environment so lexi you can now open the lines for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operating instructions your first question comes from matthew gillmor with robert baird please go ahead matthew d gillmor  robert w baird  co inc hey thanks i was hoping to get some details on the international renewals you had mentioned that was a drag on overall renewals this quarter so can you maybe remind us what are the key products consumed internationally i assume thats in the research business and then second maybe provide some details around the weaker international renewals thanks robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co sure yes its a yearlong measure so we give our renewal rate at this time every year so it reflects kind of the past year internationally and yes youre right we primarily sell research programs internationally we operate in about  countries its only on the health care side and we tend to sell maximum three individual research programs per member which is we call these skim  products we have a small team but we generally – the research programs are made up primarily of us hospital system or health system research packaged for international markets sometimes language customized we do add some local best practices again we have a small team that does research there and have done a better job over the years tailoring it but in essence its a program that – its a natural sales market for good health system research but its not like we put big investments in tailoring that work for each market and id say those have been difficult markets over the past year part of it is exchange rate impact so the programs becoming comparably more expensive as exchange rates have moved and part of its also a proactive choice on our end to focus more and emphasize more on the domestic market where we see a lot of opportunity as we continue to see regulatory change in the us and a lot of things going forward so its probably a combination of both there are also some markets if you look at the uk where the health systems been pretty challenged so if you look at the foundation trusts over there that make up our membership their economic outlook has probably worsened a little bit over the past  months as well and thats created some renewal challenges but overall i dont think theres – its not a huge huge thing to worry about they were lower than wed have wanted them to be but that tends to come and go a little bit with economic health of those markets michael t kirshbaum  the advisory board co the only thing i would add is that while the member count is higher relative to our member base it was about  of our members because each member is only buying research programs its about  of our revenue comes from international hospitals operator thank you your next question comes from mohan naidu with oppenheimer please go ahead mohan naidu  oppenheimer  co inc thanks for taking my questions robert you commented on the consulting engagements in health care ticking up can you give us a little bit more information on what is getting more attention and what theyre requesting help on and also do you see a path for these engagements to turn into technology requirements later in the year robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co yes so a twopart question the first one is when members have uncertainty in the regulatory environment and are looking for changes to their strategy consulting is a great way to help them and so i think just in general i think members have tended to lean more towards consulting than technology in this market so that business has performed well out of the gates within consulting id say the most important area has been emr optimization and thats really our work through our clinovations business i gave an example in my remarks of some of the work we do there but you have members who have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on their emr over the last few years and in many cases dont feel like theyre getting the value out of it today so they really want to find ways to leverage that installed software to provide more value and that is in the form of better reimbursement more uniform care certain other things that we can code in there and help provide better care decisions that are better economically thats a real winwin and so i think a lot of members are looking at that the other place where weve seen good performance is kind of bread and butter margin consulting so either on the cost side or the revenue cycle side and thats to be expected also when you kind of have a member base thats looking at a little bit more negative margin outlook particularly given the regulatory uncertainty they want to be sure that theyre taking cost out or focusing on some of the lowhanging fruit where they can increase revenues so those are the places where were seeing the demand leading the technology id say theres two ways to answer that one is that inherently some of the work that we do does lead to technology opportunities so we have a lot of rev cycle members where weve done revenue cycle consulting and then leave technology behind same thing on the supply chain where we do some consulting and leave behind tools that help maintain the gains and help the member ensure that theyre not backsliding those are great opportunities to come in at the end of an engagement and make a technology sale clinovations same thing theres a lot we can do on the backend to help maintain – it is a consulting engagement but you are hardwiring youre coding information feeds into the emr and so at the end of the day there are some technology leavebehinds that extend out beyond those engagements so thats a positive more broadly id say what i see across the year is members need consulting right now and if you think about the changes we made to our commercial model we now have people who are selling both technology and consulting in each of our focus areas and so they have the full portfolio of products and id say if you look at our pipelines while members are demanding a lot of consulting now those practice partners what we call them have really been able to start filling the pipelines with more technology opportunities as well as they see the opportunities come up so i think the way the commercial model is set up and the way id expect the market dynamics to behave is that as members start making more technology purchases i think well be in a great position across the second half of the year for tech sales to pick up operator thank you your next question comes from nicholas jansen with raymond james please go ahead nicholas m jansen  raymond james  associates inc hey guys thanks for all the color i just wanted to kind of get a better sense of how your sales force morale is obviously you had the changes in early january it seems like the april selling activity – through april has been reasonably on a better footing relative to this time last year so just trying to get a better sense of how we should be thinking about the cadence of sales activity i know q is a much more important quarter relative to q but any thoughts there would be helpful thanks robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co yes so through april were in good shape its obviously a small period of sales relative to may and june which are larger so great point on that one i think were going to continue working hard through june and hopefully deliver continued strong results you asked about morale morale is good i think any time you go through a restructuring on the health care side and a lot of company change being in the news around our strategic review you got to be sure we are communicating with people and help them understand why were doing what were doing and the fact that theres a lot of opportunity in everything were doing and then get people focused on the task at hand and once people kind of get embedded in the task at hand engagement and morale goes up and so there was a period earlier in the year where a lot of people moving into new roles a lot of new training you had people whod formerly sold one product now selling a portfolio of products so having to do a lot of learning but generally people like that like thats a – its an opportunity for people to gain more content knowledge to be gaining new skills and how they take that knowledge out to market and succeed commercially and ultimately hit some higher numbers as salespeople and so i think if i look across the sales force i think in general people are feeling good and excited about the year obviously technology sales have still been tough and its a place we do have people who have been in tech sales for a while and you want to be sure that they see the light at the end of the tunnel that they understand the new developments that we are making and they understand the investments were making across each of our three focus areas and why thats going to meet member demand as members start to turn attention back to tech purchasing so thats been really important to keep on across this year but in general i think id say i feel like people are focused on the right things and coming out of the gate strong and the only other commentary id make on that is with regard to may and june obviously we need to continue to do work in health care and education and particularly in education may and june are the big months for dataenabled services sales at the former royall business and a lot there  both sales and renewals across may and june so those teams are very highly focused and id expect to have good results coming from that work at the end of june operator thank you your next question comes from ryan daniels with william blair please go ahead ryan s daniels  william blair  co llc yes good afternoon thanks for taking the question i guess robert one for you when you talk about the return to tech purchasing and the hope that that picks up in the back half of the year weve seen now a couple of quarters of other vendors post the election who sell into that hospital market as well and be it niche providers or some of the larger ehr vendors they still have had i would say reasonable organic growth versus the past year or two so it doesnt appear to be hitting them as much as you guys and im curious if youve done more analysis to see how much of this is specific to your gotomarket strategy in the past and the need to improve that or the tools youre selling or the competitive environment versus truly a pause among health care purchasers thanks robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co sure on the first part of your question i cant comment specifically on what everyone else has said but thereve been some pretty big surprises out there and weve sort of been saying this since november so i think if you look at the pattern that we tend to see i think we saw it in  and  we were kind of first to feel the impact we feel that new salesonly renewals tend to hold up very well through pullbacks and we tend to be the first ones out and come out with strong growth and i think thats because we historically have continued to invest in areas we see opportunity we listen to our members were very close to them on the research and they guide us to where the opportunities are and so i think we tend to be wellpositioned when we come out and that drives good performance that pattern id expect to hold this time too were very close to our members theyre telling us what they need we understand that theyre not necessarily making as many or as quick technology purchases they might have been a couple of years ago but theres no question in their minds that the problems that they face are intractable and need external support and will involve a combination of analytics and services to solve them so i still feel very good about the market thats going to need a lot of our help and us being in a great position to serve it you know on whether its all market and us i think we were really clear when we talked about the restructuring in january thats definitely both theres definitely market impact which i think has been validated by others but id also say we had a gotomarket and a product development process that was great to fuel our growth in technology over the last six years but increasingly wasnt in line with how members wanted to buy from us and we talked a lot about why selling products on a per member basis or a per person basis one person one product when you start having    products thats a lot of people knocking on a members door and doesnt always feel coordinated and our members want partners and they want someone whos going to sit down with them and really help solve some of these larger problems and they dont really care what products it takes they just want someone to solve the problem across their capabilities and so we had to make a lot of changes to meet our members where they wanted to buy as well and thats on us and again that works very well for a long time but i dont think its worked as well over the past couple of years certainly not at the end of last year and its a big reason why if you look at our gotomarket this year its much more organized around a member we have relationship owner for every member we have practice partners instead of individual product sales people and we really now have people aligned around bringing a solution to a member across both technology and consulting versus selling individual products and by the way that philosophy even extends to research where we used to have a lot of research sales people selling one or two individual products we now have people selling the global membership across research to members in the same light so we have very strong commercial talent who are accountable for bringing the full breadth of our research capabilities to bear to a member and that stimulates some really good early conversations and in every single instance the members like absolutely this is the right model hadnt always resulted in a sale yet but across the year i think when members are pleased with the way that youre bringing them the products and services that you can deliver to them i think thats going to result in a much better set of conversations across this year so yeah ryan i mean youre exactly right its definitely the market there are some market forces out there but its also on us and i think that i really believe in the changes weve made to address both the advisory board issues and be prepared when the market issues start to abate to put us in a great place operator thank you your next question comes from steven valiquette with the bank of america please go ahead steven j valiquette  bank of america merrill lynch hi thanks good afternoon robert and michael i guess its interesting how much the world can change in three months four months from how the vibe was back in january i guess my question is does it still feel like health care clients are still waiting to see what happens with the final repeal replaceable before taking action on various projects with you guys or have the client base essentially got their arms around the scope of the newer american health care act and therefore there may be not much of a swing factor around spending patterns based on the final outcome on ahca nearterm thanks robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co yeah i think look i can answer from our perspective and its a question that im sure youll ask others our perspective is that theres a lot of regulatory uncertainty still the house barely passed ahca today its going to go through a lot of changes when it gets to the senate i do think what – so in terms of the actual regulation i think people are going to wait and see to determine how exactly it impacts them before they really make some larger investments ahead in their strategy again thats what we tend to be hearing from our members the one thing that i think is pretty clear and that members of recognized is any sort of revised or revision or past change is likely going to negatively impact provider finances it will result in some cut to medicaid and some reduced coverage all these permutations that you hear about what the house passed today would and what the senate would likely do to it if they end up passing something all those probably have that impact and so its going to continue to underscore the need to double down on efforts to improve efficiency elevate performance and expand patient access those types of things are sort of no regrets moves at this point and if you look at how weve organized our portfolio weve really tried to organize around these things that we believe and members i think increasingly see is the ticket to managing ahead under any sort of foreseeable regulatory environment so i think theyre looking to be able to live under further cuts to public reimbursement so that means doubling down on cost cutting and being sure theyre reducing care variation rationalizing footprint many of them are looking to develop an internal medicare risk strategy so macra is still out there no matter what macra is a very bipartisan bill and members who need to figure out what theyre going to do around medicare risk and apm qualification and through an opportunity to control the pace of transformation in their market in terms of movement to risk theyre focusing on physician alignment physicians are going to seek alignment given whats going on with macra so health systems are going to need to know with whom they want to work and what capacity which performance goals in mind things like that and under every circumstance given the rise in deductibles under any bill every health systems thinking about a consumeroriented care delivery structure and thats not only things on pricing in the front end but also providing more affordable access to care and greater flexibility in payment so those are all if you take all those themes those are all encompassed within the focus areas where weve aligned and i do think personally that when people have a little more certainty about what the regulatory environment is going to be then they start saying okay how are we going to address it how are we going to start making investments and how are we going to move forward so our perception is were still in the midst of a bit of pause that hopefully will abate as people get a little more clarity going forward operator thank you your next question comes from richard close with canaccord genuity please go ahead richard collamer close  canaccord genuity group inc yeah thanks michael i was wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on if we should look for contract value growth excluding the programs you discontinued if we should look for the health care side to turn positive at any other point during calendar  michael t kirshbaum  the advisory board co yes thats a good question predicting forward contract value growth is sort of like giving guidance for next year and so we dont really have a crystal ball obviously were making a lot of investments to try and deliver better as robert mentioned to meet our members where they are and get the right products out to market for this year from a revenue perspective we have a pretty wide range of health care guidance from down a couple of points to a little bit of growth and so were really early in the year its a small quarter so far were feeling pretty good through the first quarter renewals have felt pretty strong but sales in june is a big quarter coming up so i think well have a little more clarity when we get there in june were focused on trying to drive health care to better growth numbers but theres still a lot of the year left to go so its hard to give a specific number operator thank you your next question comes from stephanie davis with jpmorgan please go ahead stephanie j davis  jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question as a kind of a dovetail the prior question could you give us any puts and takes through the year and the bill for bookings and kind of the divide between health care and highered and related to that are you seeing any indications of delayed flow through in health care bookings just after your end of year dip michael t kirshbaum  the advisory board co yes so a couple of questions there so one on education i think weve seen pretty steady midteens growth in education each quarter now education does have some seasonality across the year due to the enrollment business which tends to follow the academic year tends to have larger first quarters and fourth quarters in terms of core revenue and lower second quarters and third quarters but that pattern persists yearoveryear so the growth rates are pretty steady across the year in health care weve got a little more variability because theres a consulting piece which we dont have in education so health care consulting starts and stops and sales do move around yeartoyear in terms of quarterly revenue recognition i would say for the year as an overall company we probably – we gave guidance for the second quarter to be relatively consistent with the first quarter third quarter is probably pretty similar to that and fourth quarter we see a larger increase as an overall company similar to the pattern weve seen the last couple of years and then obviously on the ebitda side since the costs are pretty steady across the year the ebitda would follow that revenue pattern and so its a little more back half weighted and theres some variability in the health care side because of the consulting timing but in general thats how we view the outlook and how the pacing weighs out for the rest of the year operator thank you your next question comes from sean wieland with piper jaffray please go ahead sean w wieland  piper jaffray  co thanks so were left with a revenue guidance here that i guess you can still drive a truck through whats the underover on that in terms of the low end versus the high end and what do you need to see before you begin to narrow that a little bit michael t kirshbaum  the advisory board co yes i think in general we had a pretty strong first quarter we finished well ahead of our guidance range that said were only one quarter into the year its our smallest sales quarter of the year and theres a lot of other things going on with the company with the strategic review et cetera that it didnt make sense to in our opinion to narrow the guidance range right now or to adjust the guidance range i think as we get through the next quarter and we get through june quarter sales its a big sales quarter for us we have a lot more visibility in the second half of the year and so when we come through june thats probably the right time to come with an updated outlook for the year but for right now i think we feel pretty confident in the range we put out at the beginning of the year and obviously had a good start through the first quarter operator thank you your next question comes from jamie stockton with wells fargo please go ahead jamie stockton  wells fargo securities llc hey good evening thanks for taking my question i know this is probably splitting hairs on the contract value but if we back out the businesses that youre winding down from the q number the sequential change in cb was down robert i hear your comment that yeartodate you like the pacing of sales should we interpret into that that maybe things got notably better in april robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co yes april was a good month i think what you had in first quarter there was a lot of realignment as we implemented a new model and the restructuring and so if i look at pipeline numbers which kind of the best leading indicator pipeline definitely improved january february and march and i think you saw some of that manifested in sales in april again like much rather be here than saying hey we started off the year slow the flipside is its a small quarter and i think we need to get a little more into the year before reading too much into kind of that sales trajectory so im trying to be balanced here but definitely have seen improvement month over month over month and thats what youd want to see so yes its good do i read too much into it not yet but well continue working hard i think well have – generally when we get through june we have a pretty good read on the rest of the year both on an inyear revenue and ebitda perspective and then how we feel about the sales trajectory operator thank you your next question comes from eric percher with barclays please go ahead eric percher  barclays capital inc thank you my line dropped so i hope this wont be duplicative but a question on the education business if we look back last year there was an opportunity as you had brought the businesses together and of course the issues we faced in year one as weve come into year three or the second year of focus is there a primary goal that is different than we saw last year or a crosssell opportunity thats substantially different than last year robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co well let me answer that in two parts number one theres still a huge crosssell opportunity so we havent captured – we only captured a tiny part of it we still have  education members and if you look at any individual business within education besides research its a much smaller footprint than that and so were still rapidly crossselling technology and data enabled services into the rest of that base and that feels like a multiyear still fantastic opportunity ahead of us the second part of the answer that id give is we have been rolling out a lot of new products leveraging royalls capabilities in the student success market so things around day one risk using what we know about students from the enrollment process to help get better at student success looking at transfer and international student opportunities and doing some things in the outcomes market i mean theres a lot that were doing thats new and so remember every time we launch another new program that creates another whole crosssell opportunity across the  member base so i guess i feel better if anything about the opportunity and path ahead in higher ed we have more members and we have more things to sell to those members and we are seeing great response and value from the things we are doing with members so that business feels like its just in exactly the right place so the story is very similar to a year ago there are cooler and different and new products that we have in the mix but i think the thesis is exactly the same and our projections forward are still very strong for it operator thank you your next question comes from matt hewitt with craighallum please go ahead matthew g hewitt  craighallum capital group llc thanks for taking my question this is more of a followup to the health care bill question earlier when you think back to when the aca was passed how much of a delay was there between the passage of the law and what it actually hit revenues for advisory board and im just trying to think about how that would translate into the new law thanks robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co yes im not sure id see the correlation there its a good question an interesting question but if you think back to what was going on then the latter half of  and the first half of  was really the financial crisis that drove our members to have a lot of concerns about their forward economics and at the time we also had a lot of oneyear contracts and so what we saw was being sure we were maintaining renewals which actually held a pretty well during that time but we saw a pretty big followup in new sales and so our revenues in  were flat in  i think it started to pick up it got to doubledigits again and in   and  we saw fantastic growth and i believe the bill was passed do you remember what the date was guys was it the beginning of – it was in that late  early  michael t kirshbaum  the advisory board co in the early  period perhaps robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co kind of january february of  so you could argue that the bill passed and within six months we were kind back at a good run rate within  months we were exceeding historical growth now again i dont necessarily think the correlation was the bill passed and that drove growth in our growth a lot of the stuff we did during  and  was investing ahead of things that our members were telling us were going to be really important and if you look at things like physician management which led to what were doing in crimson and what we did through southwind that was such a visible trend even from   and so to me that area felt a little bit like emerging from the financial crisis and being wellpositioned but there certainly was a huge bit of regulatory reform in there that gave members a lot of visibility into new paths so here we dont quite have the same financial underpinning but i do think that the new bill probably does create some margin pressure on members and the ticket out of it once they have certainty to what the regulations going to be is going to fuel another wave of purchasing and demand so i guess im gone through this answer maybe there is a little more similarities than i might have taken away so again its a good question operator your next question comes from shlomo rosenbaum with stifel shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi guys thank you for taking my questions hey michael i just wanted to get a little bit more sense as to the performance in the quarter versus the guidance you set a certain bar it was the appropriate low bar and the company exceeded it was it from strength in education did health care do better than you expected if so what areas picked up more than you expected just trying to get a gauge as to whats going on and how to view things in the context moving forward michael t kirshbaum  the advisory board co yes thanks shlomo our education business we had  education when we gave the guidance so that did what we expected to do midteens growth we gave the guidance obviously it was coming off of a pretty uncertain quarter from what we saw in the fourth quarter from sales and renewal perspective and the outperformance mostly came in health care mostly driven by as robert mentioned earlier we had a very strong consulting quarter thats both from sales and delivery and so the revenue of our performance was largely driven by health care consulting operator thank you that concludes our questionandanswer session i would now like to hand the conference back over to mr musselwhite for any closing remarks robert w musslewhite  the advisory board co well thank you all for your time and attention and your questions and im
