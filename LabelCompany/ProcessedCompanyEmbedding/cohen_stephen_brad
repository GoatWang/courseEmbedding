permissions language english quantity buying for your team add to cart description publication date march   history not ideology holds the key to growth brilliantly written and argued concrete economics shows how government has repeatedly reshaped the american economy ever since alexander hamiltons first foundational redesign this book does not rehash the sturdy and longaccepted arguments that to thrive entrepreneurial economies need a broad range of freedoms instead steve cohen and brad delong remedy our national amnesia about how our economy has actually grown and the role government has played in redesigning and reinvigorating it throughout our history the government not only sets the ground rules for entrepreneurial activity but directs the surges of energy that mark a vibrant economy this is as true for presentday silicon valley as it was for new england manufacturing at the dawn of the nineteenth century the authors argument is not one based on abstract ideas arcane discoveries or complex correlations instead it is based on the factsfacts that were once well known but that have been obscured in a fog of ideologyof how the us economy benefited from a pragmatic government approach to succeed so brilliantly understanding how our economy has grown in the past provides a blueprint for how we might again redesign and reinvigorate it today for such a redesign is

dinesh dsouza dinesh dsouza free press    epub  publishers description▼▲ at the end of world war ii the united states had all the moneyand all the power now america finds itself cash poor and to a great extent power follows money in the end of influence renowned economic analysts stephen s cohen and j bradford delong explore the grave consequences this loss will have for americas place in the world america cohen and delong argue will no longer be the worlds hyperpower it will no longer wield soft cultural power or dictate a monolithic foreign policy more damaging though is the blow to the worlds ability to innovate economically financially and politically cohen and delong also explore americans complicated relationship with china the misunderstood role of sovereign wealth funds and the return of stateled capitalism an essential read for anyone interested in how global economics and finance interact with national policy the end of influence explains the farreaching and potentially longlasting but littlenoted consequences of our great fiscal crisis author bio▼▲ stephen s cohen is a professor in the graduate school and codirector of brie the berkeley roundtable on the international economy at the university of california berkeley and senior fellow at the center for american progress he lives in san franciscoj bradford delong is a professor of economics at the university of california berkeley and a research associate at the national bureau of economic research he also writes the widely read economics blog brad delongs semidaily journal he lives in berkeley publishers weekly▼▲ in this reasoned chronicle of worldwide fiscal and cultural influence from prewwi to the present berkeley academics cohen and delong macroeconomics measure the rise and decline of us prestige concluding that the era of us dominance is over the united states will continue to be a world leader but it will no longer be the boss presenting an indepth examination of deficits export policies sovereign wealth funds the us department of defense and foreign expansion as well as caveats galore cohen and delong craft a chilling portrait of the countrys accelerating fiscal woes in every year since  the united states has run international trade deficits that collectively add up to  trillion more than  percent of that  trillion has been added since  pursuing the causes underlying the current worldwide economic crisisthe financial rules and lack thereofcohen and delong depict the effort to restore the global economy as a massive task fraught with peril and the specter of unintended consequences growing economic inequity between the us and china for instance represents a financial balance of terror though most appropriate for fiscal wonks cohen and delongs analysis is clear and concise enough for the concerned layperson jan copyright  reed business information product reviews▼▲ be the first to write a review write review ask a question▼▲ have a
