dispatch skip to content dispatch bot community news  reviews building developer friendly enterprise bots march  march   cassie bannister botness enterprise interviews sxsw for the fifth session of the day at botness enterprise platform experts got to hang out and talk about best practices in building developerfriendly enterprise bots kicking off the panel on enterprise bot platforms 🤖 including my favorite ciscospark  see us at the sxsw sparkhaus botness pictwittercomeediqos — justin ramirez justinthetechie march   there were some fantastic insights so definitely watch the video to see the full panel one of the main questions what technologies should bot developers look into early bot to bot communication everyone had a different answer amir shevat director of developer relations at slack said although bot to bot isn’t the most urgent problem to be solving right now first create good apps then let people collaborate to create things – give them as much canvas as possible give bot builders as much canvas to do good shit ashevat botness — joe lopez joepez march   steven goldsmith general manager of hipchat at atlassian said deep linking – when they acquired trello that was the first feature they offered john wang director of platform products at ringcentral mentioned helping users tie things together in a workflow – when you think about workflows where you need to interact with multiple bots users need to check multiple systems it makes sense to make these into a workflow another important broad question what are the best practices jose de castro cto of apis and integrations at cisco said there’s a tendency to impart a certain amount of personality to a bot by and large the most successful bots aren’t humanlike but instead give the user superpowers they’re extending human capabilities instead of trying to be human think about your users and try to extend their capabilities instead of pretend to be human – loopingrage of ciscospark  botness sxsw — akhanukov akhanukov march   tania mccormack director of product for ca flowdock agrees – we don’t want bots to be human but it’s important to remember to not bring habits being bossy to bots back to your team and bill bliss program manager at microsoft teams mentioned that the startup experience is key – don’t try to be cute people try to be too creative setting clear expectations and communicating the value proposition up front is best practice great to hear from the major messaging platform players botness pictwittercomtglclfjvv — joe lopez joepez march   we covered the bot
