everyone and for those of you listening from australia good morning i appreciate everyone taking the time to join us to review our  fiscal third quarter results and corporate update i want to begin todays call by emphasizing that throughout our organization there is a high level of enthusiasm this is due to the substantial achievements weve made over the past few quarters on the regulatory clinical and collaborative fronts i continue to be impressed with our durasert technology and our efforts these past few months have created several nearterm milestones especially as we approach the end of our fiscal year in june as evidenced by our progress the reprioritization of psividas development program one from higher risk longer term in its focus to one that is now more moderate risk and nearer term is expanding the pipeline and yielding positive results we have increased the number of shots on goal let me review the status for each of our programs and the substantial developments you can look for in the coming months i will then ask deb jorn our executive vice president of corporate development to provide some details on our recent market research and collaboration agreements ill begin with durasert year for posterior segment uveitis and then move on to the other programs our most advanced clinical program is our durasert year treatment for posterior segment uveitis posterior segment uveitis impacts approximately  to  patients in the united states and another  to  patients in europe who have few options to treat this chronic inflammatory disease the third leading cause of blindness in the developed world the fda required  phase iii studies and if you recall the first phase iii study met its primary efficacy pvalue of less than  and yielded safety data thats consistent with the known effect of ocular corticosteroid use while we remain blinded to the study we remain optimistic because of the first trial design and robustness of the data that the second phase iii study readout will also be positive the last patient followup occurred in early april and rod riedel our vice president of regulatory affairs has been out in the field visiting each of the sites as we keep to our time line and expect to report the second phase iii study readout by the end of june in february we also met with eu regulators and the discussions are progressing well and our current expectation is that the european market authorisation application or maa will be submitted by the end of next month concurrently we’re having advanced discussions with several potential organizations and we plan to announce an outlicense partner for durasert in the eu sometime no later this summer in the us we expect to file the nda during q  and our plan here is to go to market ourselves with a limited number of contract sales reps and scale up slowly over time however since this is an orphan disease i dont expect us needing more than  to  contract sales representatives to cover the uveitis specialists the focused small field force coupled with a favorable gross margin should contribute to our bottom line performance and shareholder return in a shorter time period than the typical pharmaceutical launch during the last few weeks we were also notified that abstracts featuring our durasert technology were accepted at leading medical conferences these acceptances clearly demonstrate the depth of our science and high level of interest from the ophthalmic community the first one is next week at the association for research in vision and ophthalmology or arvo annual meeting in baltimore on may   the data will be presented in a podium presentation by dr glenn jay jaffe robert machemer professor of ophthalmology at duke university school of medicine in durham north carolina the second presentation will be at the american society of retina specialists or asrs annual meeting being in boston in late august the data will be presented by dr david callanan md a leading ophthalmologist with texas retina associates having our data presented at these conferences by  leading authorities on uveitis is impressive and important as we prepare to submit and launch durasert in the eu and us markets as i mentioned earlier deb jorn will provide information on our market research and collaboration agreements moving beyond the eye is our durasert implant for severe osteoarthritis of the knee as we have reported the hospital for special surgery or hss in new york and psivida announced the opening of an ind in support of an investigatorsponsored clinical study of durasert to treat severe oa of the knee the durasert implant is designed to provide longterm pain relief for severe knee oa this can potentially benefit a percentage of the patients that need to delay a total knee replacement especially for those who need to improve their health or lose weight prior to knee surgery im pleased to announce the sixth and final patient in the phase i knee oa study was implanted in early april we expect hss to report the initial week data by the fourth quarter of calendar  and we’re currently in discussions with hss about the next steps for this exciting program now turning to our other technology product development opportunities our nextgeneration shorterduration product is something we envision for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis and for use in collaborations with other drug manufacturers with their small molecules as ive stated before having the ability to deliver a  to month shorterduration product has significant value to patients as they just  excuse me to physicians as they treat their patients in addition to our year product this project remains on track of note our shorter duration for uveitis as well as our collaboration outreach efforts werent even being contemplated a year ago so the companys culture and technology road map has changed and our goal is to better leverage the investments made over the previous years turning to our tki program for wet amd the evaluation of additional tkis are underway and weve identified multiple suitable tki candidates for further formulation work weve determined that pending the evaluation of tki candidates we intend to advance this program only through a collaboration partner turning to tethadur given that we do have limited resources and we’re emphasizing our development efforts on our proven durasert technology we have deemphasized our focus on tethadur we’re continuing to examine areas where we can leverage our tethadur program but any efforts would be through a collaboration agreement with that ill turn the call over to deb jorn for a review of our current market research and an update on our collaboration efforts deb debora jorn thank you nancy good afternoon everyone it is certainly an exciting time for psivida as we kick off launch planning for our new investigational durasert year product for the treatment of noninfectious posterior uveitis as part of the process we recently completed market research with retina and uveitis specialists to assess their reaction to the product profile and importantly gauge their level of interest in using the product the profile tested was based on the efficacy and safety results at  and  months from the first phase iii study the feedback from specialists was overwhelmingly positive the level of interest in using the product was assessed on a scale of with  to  with   excuse me with  being low and  being high the level of intent among specialists ranged from an  to a  this strong level of interest in using the product was driven by our first phase iii study results demonstrating a significant and durable reduction in the recurrence rates of uveitis improvements in best corrected visual acuity or socalled bcva and a favorable tolerability profile at  months specialists viewed the durasert year insert as an important addition to their current treatment options given its ability to provide consistent longterm control of chronic posterior uveitis versus currently available treatment options less recurrences or flares was perceived as an important  was perceived as important for preserving vision over the long term we look forward to providing physicians with this new treatment option to help improve the lives of patients suffering from the debilitating effects of this potentially blinding disease now let me turn and spend a few moments updating you on our business development initiatives since joining psivida  months ago my major focus has been to significantly increase the number of collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies leveraging our proven and proprietary durasert technology platform we have already signed one feasibility study agreement well ahead of schedule and we’re in active discussions with other pharmaceutical companies to establish additional collaboration agreements in addition we have been focused on securing an eu outlicense partner for the year durasert uveitis product we’re well into the process with several potential partners and we expect to finalize a partnership later this summer with that thank you and i will turn it over to len leonard ross thank you deb and good afternoon everyone i will briefly review our fiscal third quarter results we reported following todays close revenue for the third fiscal quarter ended march   was  compared to  for the prior year quarter third quarter operating expenses were  million compared to  million a year ago the net loss for the quarter ended march   was  million or  per share compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the prior year quarter during the third quarter net cash used in operations totaled approximately  million and we anticipate net operating cash usage of approximately  million in each of the next few quarters during the fiscal  third quarter we issued approximately  million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately  million through the utilization of our existing atthemarket or atm program at march   our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  million subsequent to the balance sheet date we have continued to strengthen our balance sheet through further utilization of the atm program and have issued approximately  million additional shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately  million at april  our cash balance was approximately  million given the  annual limitation as defined on the issuance of shares pursuant to the listing rules of the australian securities exchange or asx without stockholder approval we expect to conclude the current utilization of the atm program in the coming days ill turn the call now back over to nancy for her closing comments nancy lurker thank you len before opening call up to questions id like to follow up on lens comments regarding the use of our atm in order to execute the strategy weve laid out for you which is to grow the top and bottom line and thereby increase shareholder returns we have to invest in the programs we’re implementing and that requires additional resources at the same time our australian stock exchange listing means that we’re limited in terms of equity rate up to  of our shares outstanding before getting shareholder approval our board evaluated a variety of financing strategies and determined that the most efficient and minimally dilutive one given the boundaries that we have to operate within was the atm the results from the effort illustrate it was the right decision and was well executed at the same time we’re filing a proxy today for a special meeting of shareholders to fulfill an australian stock exchange requirement to get shareholder approval to allow us to sell up to an additional  of our shares approval would enable us to maximize our options as we seek the resources required to execute our strategies in  our entire team is focused on executing several nearterm objectives including reporting the top line results from the second pivotal phase iii study in june submitting our filing with the eu regulators in june finalizing an eu outlicense partnership for our year uveitis product during the summer months leveraging the clinical study data being presented at leading medical conferences to reinforce the strength of our science and technical difficulty continuing our collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies as well as entering into others filing our nda in the us during the fourth quarter of calendar  this is perhaps the most exciting period in the history of the company its important that we maintain this positive momentum and its important that we explore available strategies to meet the future capital resources needs required to achieve the companys growth objectives during  and beyond as well as maximize shareholder value in summary we have a number of key milestones over the next few months and i look forward to providing updates as we continue to make solid progress operator were now ready to take questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of suraj kalia from northland securities suraj kalia nancy can you hear me all right nancy lurker absolutely suraj kalia perfect okay so nancy forgive me ive been hopping between  calls in case some of this has already  you guys have given some additional color my apologies the biopharma partner youll sign in the quarter  any  did you all give any details on whether its  it was in osteoarthritis it was something else what the terms of the deal was duration of the deal nancy lurker no we cant we have not disclosed anything we did file an k with minimal information suraj kalia got it and i presume you guys are precluded confidentiality reasons not to talk about it nancy lurker oh yes suraj kalia whether its  which therapeutic segment and whatnot nancy lurker absolutely so if we’re successful i would anticipate that down the road we can certainly disclose more suraj kalia nancy there is as you very well know  you and i have talked about this multiple times on osteoarthritis  you guys are stealthily working on something that has eluded a lot of other companies i know the data for the phase i hss study is going to be towards the latter part of the year any directional  any color you can give on how thats shaping up on the  patients i know there were pain scores and whatnot that  what should we expect by the end of the year and what should we look inaudible phase ii nancy lurker yes let me just say this it is an openlabel study however right now we anticipate releasing results after the end of the month period the  months of efficacy and thats a combination of efficacy pain as well as signs and symptoms of movement however we will evaluate if it merits it we will only do that in collaboration with hss if we should decide to discuss any of the results a little earlier i cant promise that because it is openlabel but obviously we’re in close contact with our collaboration partners and were very pleased with the direction of the collaboration suraj kalia and since its openlabel admittedly some of the patients have been recent and we dont know how theyre performing i can appreciate that have you been approached by any strategic to cofund if i can create that word cofund this trial andor work together on this product at this stage nancy lurker yes youre asking very good questions suraj obviously i cant disclose anything but let me just say this that we’re certainly evaluating our next steps with this our goal is to leverage this technology platform and its really a platform technology because this can be used in multiple joints in the body and potentially down the road use other small molecules beyond just dexamethasone which is currently in the implant right now so we will be working closely with our partner hss and looking at the options to maximize the value to both us and hss at this time i cant disclose anything more but suffice it to say we’re actively engaged and actively looking at how to  what the next steps are suraj kalia and finally nancy and ill hop back in queue the third party cro strategy  still thinking about   people would suffice for durasert uveitis nancy lurker yes so first i think you mean cso contract sales organization suraj kalia oh cso sorry nancy lurker im going to  thats okay im going to turn that question over to deb jorn suraj kalia thats what happens when youre toggling between  different calls so my apologies nancy lurker thats all right go ahead deb debora jorn hi suraj well as you know the number of prescribers because this is an orphan disease is very limited so therefore we can go to market with a very small sales force utilizing a cso to cut costs and also we will have very favorable gross margins and that should contribute to our bottom line and lead to substantial return to our shareholders in a reasonable period of time we believe following launch nancy lurker yes and just to clarify its  to … debora jorn  nancy lurker right yes debora jorn  to  representatives suraj kalia they should be good enough okay fair enough operator the next question comes from the line of matt kaplan from ladenburg thalmann matthew kaplan one of the new things you mentioned in terms of your prepared remarks was talking about an exus partnership expected this summer can you give us some details in terms of how to think about that  what the structure would be and how that would work nancy lurker okay im going to also turn that over to deb obviously we cant disclose a lot of details on that matthew kaplan you bet nancy lurker but go ahead deb deb jorn well it would be an outlicense where the partner would be responsible for the sales and marketing and bringing the product forward to the marketplace including securing reimbursement in all the countries this will be a centralized procedure so there will be a number of countries well be looking to have that partner immediately move forward to launch it matthew kaplan so should we expect kind of upfront payment royalties milestone payments that kind of thing nancy lurker yes i would  you should plan on the typical deal obviously just remember it is uveitis which is a orphan disease so given that and the fact that it is relatively small revenuewise as ive stressed profitability should be good because as ive mentioned our gross margins are good on this our cogs are very low and we dont expect to have a big robust field force nevertheless because it is a relatively small category youre not going to see large upfronts matthew kaplan got it thats helpful thank you and also in your remarks you were talking about your technical difficulty the analysis and survey that youve completed can you give us a little bit more color on that as well in terms of how  and how will doctors incorporate this into their practice and when would they use it in terms of what line of therapy are they thinking about nancy lurker okay during the discussions we specifically asked physicians where this would fit into their treatment paradigm and certainly what weve heard was a lot of patients would be potentially switched from products such as ozurdex ozurdex has a certain duration be it  to  months in terms of controlling the condition so this was seen as for that chronic patient a maybe more appropriate longerterm control of a chronic condition and also with retisert primarily because retisert requires surgical implantation whereas this product is an intravitreal injection and also has a much lower concentration of fluocinolone acetonide the active corticosteroid and given the tolerability profile shown in our month data from the phase iii so to answer your question i think they believe that this is a incredible option for patients with chronic recurring rather than the multiple injections that currently has to happen andor use of systemic therapy debora jorn yes and let me just add to that matt which is that just recall that for uveitis the only real treatment option thats available right now are corticosteroids humira is approved for systemic use for uveitis but clearly due to the cost and of course you do have a  youve got many tolerability considerations to take into effect that is not something that we would expect nor doctors indicate would be used in any way first or even second line but more primarily as a last resort so again corticosteroids are their only option in treating uveitis so obviously and it certainly showed up in the research that we would expect to be used fairly soon in the treatment of these patients nancy lurker since many of them have already been on  the chronic patients have been on therapy for some time with multiple injections the thought was that the doctor would likely move those patients  the appropriate patients right away to this longerduration product matthew kaplan great great thats helpful thanks and then i guess one last question on the implant program that you have specifically in the knee osteoarthritis you mentioned youre also thinking about pursuing other products besides steroids can you give us a sense in terms of what type of products to add to that delivery system nancy lurker yes so let me say this i want to be  the  just add a caveat which is that is strictly in the planning stage so thats not something that we anticipate doing right away our main goal right now is to start to plan for phase ii for our knee osteoarthritis program which currently has a terrific steroid in it dexamethasone but beyond that you could envision nonsteroidal antiinflammatories in the implant small molecule antibiotics others might be antifibrinolytics just some examples we have not explored all the other options nor have we prioritized them but im simply putting out there that this can go many different directions as we look at using this implant in treating the entire orthopedic patient community operator the next question comes from the line of yi chen from hc wainwright yi chen hi thank you for taking my questions nancy my first question is assuming the data coming out from the second pivotal phase iii trial is positive do you expect anything else  any other hurdle before submitting the nda nancy lurker im sorry ask the question one more time yi chen assuming you have positive data coming from the second pivotal phase iii study in june do you expect any other hurdles from the fda before submitting the nda nancy lurker well first of all let me just say this you can never predict for sure and so im not  i  we obviously plan to have a prenda meeting with the fda and certainly we will learn more there i will just say that when you look  if  when you look at our first phase iii study and again we do not know the results of our second phase iii study but should our second phase iii study be as positive as our first phase iii study thats pretty powerful data to go into the fda with and im just going to leave it at that because its difficult to predict these things yi chen okay second question i know you will start preclinical studies for the shorteracting durasert so when the shorteracting version of durasert enters clinic i guess it is a bioerodible version versus the nonerodible version for the longacting durasert correct so will there be any difference in terms of clinical trial design and endpoints nancy lurker yes so let me just say this we’re right now in the preclinical stage and the approach to how we bring this to market is still under evaluation so obviously our goal is to get it to market as soon as possible and theres any number of ways we can do that so were evaluating our option set now yi chen okay my final question  so after you finish the phase iii trial the ongoing phase iii trial and when you move forward with other projects what are the likely operating expenses or cash burns  quarterly cash burn that we can expect for the rest of the year nancy lurker okay so if youre saying for the rest of  yi chen or  if you have  you can provide some comments that would be inaudible nancy lurker we havent given any forward guidance into that we havent given any forward guidance let me give you thematically where were going with this obviously were keeping a tight control on expenses we have our ongoing phase iii study costs so we certainly do not expect expenses to go down i can say that and what we do expect is modest  potentially modest slow increases quarterover quarter as we start to slowly begin to plan for and then start to build out the commercial infrastructure which again i want to reiterate we do not expect to have by any means a large commercial infrastructure here you do not need it which is another reason why were going to use a contract sales organization so were talking a couple marketers youve got some  obviously weve got a couple of people from managed care youre going to need a couple people on the medical affairs side but very very small footprint but were  im not giving forward guidance at this time okay sorry len why dont you just add one comment leonard ross yes i think in my earlier comments i indicated that at least for the next few quarters we expected operating cash use to be about  million a quarter and thats consistent generally with what it has been and reflects obviously the ongoing cost of the phase iii clinical development program which still has a ways to go before its totally complete operator operator instructions the next question comes from the line of shekhar basu from basu capital shekhar basu thank you for taking my call i appreciate it i just wondered the existing product from alcon  how much in revenues is that doing can you just remind us please debora jorn do you mean allergan the ozurdex shekhar basu sorry allergan yes debora jorn yes its about  million i believe nancy lurker well no its projected its projected for this year it did around  million in  worldwide debora jorn right shekhar basu okay and my second question was that your product device is inserted for a period of  years and i just wondered in terms of the adverse events and any inflammation or iop elevation that one can get in the event that theres adverse event if the patient  what is  well how does the physician feel about managing that because they cant really take the insert out can they dario paggiarino yes i will answer that is correct you dont take the insert out now this is obviously an insert that is delivering fluocinolone and in  although its delivering fluocinolone a very low rate and the effects  we see some effect that are typical of steroids so effect on iop cataract but without going to the details about the specific incident we feel very comfortable about the fact that these are manageable they are expected and they  again consistent with the pharmacological effect of steroids in the eye but overall i think the feedback from the investigators is positive and i think the data will clearly define the safety profile of this insert nancy lurker yes that was dr dario paggiarino our chief medical officer dario why dont you just comment on the pivotal phase iii  data around iop elevation which was very minimal dario paggiarino its very minimal so in terms of the  if we look at the data now we have month data so if we look at the iop elevation at  months its very modest were talking about  or  millimeters compared to the sham which also has very modest so on average we see very little increase compared to sham we also  importantly we see a modest elevation that is stable over time and again as we collect more data i think its very important to establish that safety profile nancy lurker okay and one last question if i may on the cso decision i dont know how many csos actually are able and capable of promoting a very small product to a very small audience typically csos are able to do a second or third detail but not a first detail typically so im just wondering has the ophthalmic category  are they really able to push it appropriately nancy lurker yes well you asked the right person because i was the ceo of pdi which was the secondlargest cso in the united states for  years until we sold it to publicis so im very very familiar with csos and let me assure you since i know the category so well that we’re very confident we know in fact indeed that csos absolutely manage small field forces like this its not like it used to be in the heydays if you go back when i first started at pdi we would hire  to person teams and over the years as  because of whats gone on in the size of  the shift of pharma into these small specialty disease areas the average size of teams has gone all the way down to  and we often launch teams for people even with  reps that was not atypical at all so its very very doable and the other key point i just want to make is remember that one of the errors that people seem  most people dont understand about csos is that they dont  these reps that they hire they hire directly for your needs so its not their rep it is their reps but theyre hired and dedicated to a particular product so in our case we would lay out for them the profile of the rep that we want them to go out and hire for us and then theyre very very good at knowing all the representatives across the united states in every therapeutic category and then accessing that  those databases that they have and recruiting those reps specific to whatever therapeutic area you want them to do it doesnt matter if its ophthalmology hospital rare disease  you name it they can do it so were quite confident on that front that this is eminently doable debora jorn and in fact at my previous clients we hired pdi we had a small orphan drug product and actually i utilized nancys company pdi and we built out a team of  individuals operator there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to mr sherk for closing remarks douglas sherk thank you blair before we end the call i would like to note that in connection with the special meeting of stockholders referenced by nancy

no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement in order to reflect recent events or circumstances that may arise after this conference call now i’d like to turn the call over to psivida’s president and chief executive officer nancy lurker nancy lurker thank you doug and good afternoon everyone i appreciate everyone taking the time to join us this afternoon this was my first full quarter with psivida and with each passing month i become more impressed with the team and the opportunities afforded by our proven and wellvalidated science at the same time i continue to believe that our technology is an undervalued asset despite having developed  of only  fdaapproved sustained release treatments for back of the eye diseases we are working very hard to change this situation and have made solid progress since we last talked in early november over the next several quarters we have three overarching objectives for our company first we expect to complete european union and us fda registration filings during  for our durasert year uveitis product second we expect to continue the recent progress of several programs using our unique durasert sustained release technology and third we are striving to add at least one additional collaboration partnership with a drug manufacturer utilizing durasert achieving these objectives in a costefficient manner is paramount to our team one of my first acts as ceo was to preprioritize psivida’s development program profile from one that was higher risk longer term in its focus to one that is now moderate risk and achieves results near term we have several significant data and regulatory milestones this year and i believe achieving these milestones should benefit our shareholders our durasert year treatment for posterior segment uveitis is our most advanced clinical program posterior segment uveitis impacts approximately  to  patients in the united states and another  to  patients in europe we have few options to treat this chronic inflammatory disease which is the third leading cause of blindness the durasert uveitis second phase  study met its enrollment target and the timing for the readout is planned by the end of second quarter if you recall the fda required two phase  studies for filing and the first phase  study met its primary efficacy pvalue of less than  and yielded safety data that is consistent with the known effect of ocular corticosteroid use we are very pleased with the primary efficacy and safety results at  months and the safety and durable efficacy results at  months we remain optimistic the second phase  study readout will be positive due to the robustness of the first phase  trial data and the fact that trial designs are similar as we discussed during the fiscal first quarter conference call the european regulators required us to submit a pediatric protocol prior to the eu submission we submitted the protocol we received their comments and we expect to have final followup discussions during the next coming weeks the end result is that we continue to expect to file the eu application during the second quarter of calendar  in the us we expect to file the nda during the second half of calendar  we have a number of durasert technology product development opportunities including our next generation durasert bioerodible shorter duration treatment for posterior segment uveitis and for using collaborations with other drug manufacturers with their small molecules we recently conducted market research for both our year durasert for uveitis and month bioerodible for uveitis physicians were very positive about durasert’s proven ability to deliver a consistent daily microdose of a corticosteroid the consistent daily microdose is believed to be one of the reasons behind the efficacy results we are seeing from the clinical studies in addition the physicians were impressed with the product’s ability to prevent recurrent flares that often lead to blindness further our market research also covered physicians’ level of interest in the month bioerodible for uveitis that feedback was also very positive for the need for such a shorter acting product as a result this research has enhanced our confidence and the market potential for durasert year uveitis once we receive approval and in addition it has also reinforced our prioritization of the month durasert bioerodible for uveitis programs and we are conducting formulation testing now our objective is to begin preclinical safety and pk studies of this product in the second quarter of calendar  we are also initiating efforts to form collaborations with other drug manufacturers for combining their small molecule drugs with this shorter duration form of durasert to address patient needs in other indications another clinical program underway is the durasert implant for severe osteoarthritis of the knee as we have reported the hospital for special surgery in new york and psivida announced the opening of an investigatorsponsored ind of durasert to treat severe oa of the knee the durasert implant is designed to provide longterm pain relief for severe knee oa which if affected could potentially result in the delay of knee replacement surgery todate  patients have received the implant and the hospital for special surgery expects to have the final patient implanted during the next month while a safety and tolerability study changed from baseline in weekly mean of pain intensity scored at rest during activity and at night will be assessed weekly through  weeks we are currently in discussion with hss about the next steps for this program turning to our tki program for wet amd the evaluation of additional tkis are underway and we have identified multiple suitable tki candidates for further formulation work we have determined that pending the evaluation of tki candidates we intend to advance this program only through the development of a corporate partnership finally there is our tethadur preclinical program that applies proprietary technology to achieve the sustained release of large molecule such as biologics through a silicabased technology preclinical activities on this program are continuing and we are implementing a strategy to pursue partnerships to advance the program’s development in addition to our ongoing programs we have also taken steps during the past few weeks to expedite potential collaborations based on our proven durasert technology with other drug candidates deb jorn who has joined psivida in november is heading up this effort and she and the team are focused on establishing additional new collaborations and eu outlicensing partnership and preparing for the us launch of our durasert year uveitis program once again our objective is to enter into at least one new additional collaboration agreement prior to the end of the current calendar year before i turn the call over to len let me summarize why we are excited first on the regulatory front we plan on submitting the eu marketing approval application for our durasert year treatment for posterior segment uveitis in the second quarter of the current calendar year and in the us we continue to expect to submit the nda in the second half of the calendar year second we will be announcing the results of our second phase  clinical trials in posterior segment uveitis by the end of the first half of calendar  again we feel very good about the prospects for a positive outcome of the study due to the positive results of the first phase  study third we are also looking forward to the implantation of the  patient for oa at hss the data evaluation and then working with hss to determine the next steps and lastly deb and her team continue to foster relationships with potential collaboration and outlicense partners our goal is to enter into at least one additional collaboration agreement with drug developers for our durasert technology and an eu outlicense for our year uveitis product we are also making very solid progress on both those fronts i will now turn the call over to len ross for a brief review of our first quarter financials len len ross thank you nancy and good afternoon everyone i will briefly review our fiscal second quarter and first half results that we reported following today’s close revenue for the second fiscal quarter ended december  was  million compared to  for the prior year quarter the yearoveryear increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred collaborative research and development revenue totaling  million resulting from the terminated collaboration agreement with pfizer disclosed in late december second quarter operating expenses were  million compared to  million a year earlier the general and administrative expenses were higher in this year’s quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to severance related costs our research and development costs were lower in this year’s second quarter primarily due to the higher expense accruals associated with the durasert phase  clinical trials in the year ago quarter the net loss for the quarter ended december   was  or a breakeven on a per share basis compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the prior year quarter at december   cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  million during the second quarter we used approximately  million for operations and we anticipate a somewhat higher rate of cash usage from operations in the third fiscal quarter due to the timing of annual insurance policy renewals and clinical milestone payments as we have noted on previous calls the timing and amounts of our cro clinical milestone payments have continuously fluctuated from quartertoquarter the board and management are consistently evaluating strategies to provide the company with the resources required to achieve our objectives and are keenly focused on those strategies that would minimize shareholder dilution i will now turn the call back over to nancy for her closing comments nancy lurker thank you len our focus on moderate risk nearterm potential product development programs should yield promising results the feedback we received from our recently conducted market research validates that our durasert year uveitis product meets an unmet need in the marketplace as well as the initial physician interest in the month program for uveitis in summary we have a number of solid catalysts this year and i look forward to providing updates as we continue to make progress operator we are ready now to take questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from matt kaplan from ladenburg thalmann your line is now open matt kaplan hi guys can you hear me nancy lurker we can hear you hi matt matt kaplan hi nancy thanks for taking the questions i guess starting off just focusing on the european filing for the year durasert can you give us a sense in terms of where you are in finalizing the pediatric study protocol with european regulatory authorities nancy lurker yes we are very close and we are actually quite pleased with the progress that we have made they have been very responsive and as a result as i have said we remain very confident that we will be able to close it out and file in the second quarter of fiscal – of calendar year  matt kaplan okay very good and then drilling down a little bit with respect to your plans in europe where are you in your european partnering discussions as you get closer to filing when can we expect a potential partnership nancy lurker well let me just say this that we have been – first of all deb jorn who is our executive vice president of corporate development has done a fantastic job leading that effort and we have been in contact with tens of multiples of companies around the potential outlicense and we are on track obviously i am not going to go into specifics in terms of timing but we have a very thorough process for that auction and so far we have had good responses so i would expect that certainly before the second half of the year is out that we may be able to answer that question if not in the third quarter would be the goal by the third quarter of calendar  as you know though matt i just want to caution that obviously as you get into due diligence and then final negotiation sometime things can take a little longer than anticipated matt kaplan fair enough i guess do you expect to have multiple kind of regional or country specific partnerships or would it be one kind of for the entire region in the europe nancy lurker yes you know what i am not going to predict at this time let me just say again it could be either one of those and we will see what the level of interest is obviously as you are going – someone who has got global reach they are a much much larger company if you are going to a more regional approach then you are going to be dealing with obviously more midsize to smaller players matt kaplan great and then with your osteoarthritis of the knee program congrats on the progress there can you give us a sense in terms of how the first five patients that you have treated so far how did they look and what are the results there nancy lurker i am going to actually turn that over to dr paggiarino who is our chief medical officer to discuss the hss program dario paggiarino yes matt so first of all this was as you recall a safety study primarily in a small number of patients so the first objective was to evaluate safety but also to have the opportunity to have a preliminary assessment of the effect on pain and function and overall todate the data seem to suggest that the treatment is well tolerated and there may be some indications of – that these patients are doing well so we look forward for the six patients we enrolled in the study matt kaplan and how should we – how should we think about in terms of the presentation or announcement of the data once the sixpatient is valuable will that be in a press release or we will have to wait to it till it’s presented at a medical meeting or how will that work nancy lurker yes first of all we are in a collaboration with hss so we will have to work with them on that and right now we are looking at it will be summer time before anything gets released just because of the timing of the enrollment of the patients and i am not going to speculate at this time how we would release those data matt kaplan and when you said in your prepared remarks you are kind of looking at the next steps for the program what are you contemplating in terms of next steps at this point nancy lurker yes so the next steps with hss is going to be finalizing how we are going to work together going forward so any number of types of arrangements are currently being considered with hss matt kaplan okay and that includes doing a larger type of phase  study or nancy lurker yes so first of all there is a big math – there is the basic structure of the agreement and then there is the clinical plan going forward so both of those items need to be – need to still be worked on we were in the process of both of those discussions now matt kaplan okay very good that’s helpful well thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress across the board nancy lurker okay thank you matt operator thank you and your next question comes from suraj kalia from northland securities your line is now open suraj kalia good afternoon folks thank you for taking my question so nancy let me start out with the durasert bioerodible a couple of subquestions within this question why six months is it just because uveitis occurs or at least most of the recurrence occurs within the first six months to nine months is that why you are all choosing a sixmonth is it because of the technology or is it simply because as a way to reduce iop and glaucoma numbers in the bioerodible implant nancy lurker yes so those are all very good questions and again i am going to answer some of them i am going to turn some of it over to the dario again but let me just say this in general with our technology we can time the release depending on the molecule that’s in there from one month by month all the way out to  months so it’s not a matter of that’s what the technology will allow because we could – literally with our corticosteroid we could time it for eight months we could time it for  months it doesn’t matter we have that level of sophistication around how much we release over what time period the reason we have gone for six months is because consistently when we have gone out and done market research and there has been prior market research that’s been done at psivida as well as this most recent market research that we did as well as when we are in discussions with potential collaboration partners with their small molecules consistently what comes out is that six months is an ideal window where physicians want to be able to say alright most – as you know most drugs for back of the eye disease are administered with monthly injections that’s typical so you are not typically going to get payer response or the value that you need unless you can get beyond three months with patients because if you end up with just two months to three months we got to come back in it’s not that much of an improvement over a monthly injection and so then the second thing is is they don’t want to go beyond six months because it takes too long before they see the patient again you run the risk of saying – and regardless either with our  years they would still expect they are going to see the patients back in the office on a semiregular basis so  months seems to be that nice window when it is long enough that you are getting a real advantage over monthly injections but not so long as well that they run the risk of losing the patient to oversize so i am going to turn it over to dr paggiarino if he wants to add anything to that dario paggiarino no i think i don’t really have much to add i think it gives the flexibility of treating physicians to those patients with the flexible schedule suraj kalia but nancy would i be too far off in saying that maybe unintended or an unintended effect of this could be reducing high iop andor glaucoma incidents in these patients who are treated with the bioerodible implant could that be a direct correlation dario paggiarino it’s hard to speculate on data we will – i think the clinical data will have to speak to that now the advantage of – so i don’t want to speculate on the effect on eye specifically certainly the advantage of the bioerodible by itself is that the components of the inserts are absorbed so they may allow maybe dosing but in terms of side effect profile of a bioerodible indiscernible i think it’s too early to hit through that nancy lurker yes but let me just add suraj as well that clearly with the durasert technology in general we have made enormous progress since retisert was put on the market and so our intraocular serum levels of corticosteroid are much much lower than when you get to with the bolus injection that occur monthly even some of the competitor who is out there when they are injecting you get a much higher spike in corticosteroid and there is a good correlation though it’s not been proven positive it’s certainly there is a correlation between that and iop suraj kalia got it and how much do you all intend to spend on this program nancy lurker we are not going to disclose that but let me just say this right now that relative to other clinical programs it’s modest in cost and we are going to be highly conscious to do it in the most cost efficient manner you can imagine because we will be looking at this as potentially a supplemental new nda to our current nda that the cost could be lower than a new nda suraj kalia got it in terms of the pediatric indication in europe nancy help me understand or at least remind me why pediatric why now why go down this – i mean is uveitis a big issue in pediatrics and forgive me if i am just end of the day i am sort of braindead and maybe it is but nancy lurker you have been on too many calls suraj suraj kalia yes its earnings seasons so forgive me nancy lurker look it’s not a problem at all we are required to we submitted a waiver i believe we disclosed this early we submitted a waiver that waiver was denied so the european regulatory authorities are basically as a condition of filing requiring us to have an approved pediatric protocol it is extremely rare in children to see this condition and that is why we requested a waiver however the regulatory authorities believe since the conditions still exist they would like to see that we conduct this study and again i want to reiterate the study we do not – will not need to be started until after we get the drug approved suraj kalia got it and finally nancy maybe i missed this any update on your cso strategy that would be great folks thank you for taking my questions nancy lurker no update at this time it’s still too early we would expect to start that postfiling in the us suraj kalia thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from vernon bernardino from fbr  company your line is now open vernon bernardino hi nancy thanks for taking my question most of them were related to the certain implants in severe osteoarthritis but just going back as far as the study is concerned how do you decide for example you have dosed five patients how do you decide how and when to proceed to the next patient in this case the six patients nancy lurker that’s strictly related to the patient enrollment criteria and again this is an investigator sponsored study so we are not involved in that and that is strictly related to making sure that the patients meet the enrollment criteria vernon bernardino and can you remind us in particular what that is such that it’s met and then they proceed onto the next patient nancy lurker yes again i will have dr paggiarino answer these questions dario paggiarino so the plan was to enroll six patients and the – with the objective of waiting essentially safety and efficacy preliminary efficacy and so the criteria of these are patients who are candidates for knee replacement and they will obviously benefit from the improvement companion function and so the targeted number was six patients and on the basis that that would allow again a preliminary assessment but also the ability to work with the insert and really refine the insertion technology so to speak from the surgeon vernon bernardino okay and it’s an exciting opportunity obviously but can you confirm that one other things you might disclose is a data on delay of knee replacement surgery or no nancy lurker no that’s not one of the in criteria dario paggiarino these are candidates yes nancy lurker right these are candidates and remember we expect to disclose the results after the end of six months and that is the end points are pain measured on womac score which is a very well validated pain score as well as overall knee movement and articulation it’s not – at this early stage phase  it’s not delay of tkr though we would expect it potentially as we move into phase  that could be one of the endpoints vernon bernardino okay so we won’t see any data as far as on tkr nancy lurker no vernon bernardino okay alright just want to confirm that that’s all the questions i have thank you nancy lurker you’re very welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from guy dietrich from dietrich capital partners your line is now open nancy lurker hi guy guy dietrich hi nancy how are you today nancy lurker good guy dietrich i have got a twopart question given the fda has indicated they are potentially embarking on a much more streamlined approval process i am wondering if i can get a little more transparency on your thinking on this subject and how it could favorably impact psivida and then secondly given the strength of your first phase  trial for posterior uveitis which really had superb results despite these really compelling results the fda requested a second phase  trial which may not be concluded until midyear so i wonder given the dynamics in place right now and i realize it’s sort of a moving target have you considered sort of a more rapid and perhaps filing an nda just based on the strength of your first phase  trials while continuing the second one nancy lurker yes so actually good question guy and we did consider that and in fact we did go back and show the fda our first phase  trial results because they were so robust and the fda still wants us to finish and file along with the second study so we did attempt to do that i will also say that we continue to look at other ways that we could approach this to expedite things we have retained outside consultant who has got a lot of expertise in this as well as obviously continue to rely on our internal regulatory expertise and it continues to fall in line that right now we need to continue to file both studies and we are filing them as quick as possible after we get the results in as to whether or not we would anticipate anything to speed up i think again what we have heard from again both our internal regulatory as well as external is that you need to get the fda – new fda commissioner in place it’s going to probably take just a little bit of time so i would expect that if anything it probably wouldn’t impact us on the current regulatory filings perhaps it could impact when we file – potentially file for our month bioerodible guy dietrich okay thank you nancy lurker thank you guy operator i am showing no further questions at this moment i’d like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks nancy lurker i want to thank everyone for participating in today’s call and i look forward to many potentially positive events that are going to occur this year so thank you for your time and i look forward to updating you on our next call operator ladies and gentlemen
