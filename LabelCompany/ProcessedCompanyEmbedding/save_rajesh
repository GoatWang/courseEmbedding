be the sacred abode of lord vishnu one of the three supreme deities in the hindu trinity the practice of religion here is devout and ritualistic with great faith being invested in the idol and the customs of the temple the temple is visited by  million devout pilgrims annually requiring organised crowd management the area is considered auspicious for wedding rituals and celebrations and caters to discerning business travellers who like to combine leisure conferences with a divine temple visit save this picture  rajesh vora the brief required us to build a  key boutique hotel on a  sqm plot of land at the foothills of the saptagiri mountain range the functions included guests rooms  suites banqueting facilities a business center health center with a spa gym a games room  swimming pool and  specialty restaurants save this picture  rajesh vora save this picture ground plan save this picture  rajesh vora the all pervading position of the worship of lord balaji or lord vishnu in this temple town pointed us towards an environment that embodies the classical elements of temple architecture  the orthogonal introverted hindu temple plan the need to express both divinity and serenity after the overwhelming experience of gaining a glimpse of the lord also guided this design these ideas have been refined  distilled into a contemporary building with a central open courtyard and a water body within which “floats” the all day dining space – ‘the lotus café’ envisioned as a lotus in the pond this central water body forms the core of the hotel both spatially  experientially simplicity and divinity are the core values this building stands for whereas the interiors draw on craft mythology and symbolism to weave a story that one encounters throughout the project save this picture  rajesh vora mythology recounts that the lord vishnu appeared on the earth in ten incarnations called the dasavatara  each avatar appropriate to his position as a saviour within that era it is said that whenever there is a decline of religion vishnu is said to incarnate himself to protect the good to destroy the wicked and reestablish the balance of life on earth these avatars also represent the evolution of humankind and each embody character stories colour and emotion the interiors of all the public spaces have been designed to represent an avatar replete with character colour and symbolism save this picture  rajesh vora craft  culture are an inherent part of the indian ethos  are embedded as tradition within rural communities every region has its distinct crafts that reflect its history andhra pradesh the state in which tirupati resides is known for its varied textiles  metal crafts symbols associated with these ten avatars have been contemporized using the “dokra
