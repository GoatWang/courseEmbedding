and musical friends rolling with the society of st anne on carnival day the joyous license of new orleans parade music goes handinhand with rollicking devilmaycare spirit of mardi gras mardi gras music like christmas music is not so much a style of music as it is an aural milieu comprised of various forms among them orchestral and bigband arrangements played at tableau balls mardi grasthemed rhythmandblues numbers that pour out of jukeboxes “cuttingloose” jazz tunes that drive revelers to “shake booty” and pump umbrellas in the air afrocaribbean chants and percussive rhythms associated with mardi gras indians and paradetime beats from school bands marching between floats in parades the nexus between carnival and music reflects the festive letthegoodtimesroll culture of the crescent city where parading and dancing have long been obsessions “the desire for celebration is part of new orleans culture” scholar and clarinetist michael white once remarked on a radio program “we parade at the drop of a hat for just about any event you can imagine you get married you die if someone is born we parade sometimes just for the sake of parading and people get out and dance that’s what the spirit is all about” indeed this spirit of joie de vivre — ie the mardi gras spirit — is almost a precondition of the sounds for which the crescent city became famous as dr john — arguably the foremost living interpreter of the city’s musical traditions — observes in the liner notes for his grammywinning goin’ back to new orleans album “new orleans music was not invented it just kind of grew up naturally joyously just for fun” being a musician in new orleans is all about having fun with the music and at no time is this more evident than during carnival season the same mardi gras spirit that prompts revelers to shed inhibitions and seek ritual transformation has a way of encouraging playfulness and spontaneity on the bandstand as well as countless variations on old carnival favorites such as “carnival time” “hey pocky way” “second line” “go to the mardi gras” and “big chief” and it seems that almost every year brings the release of new wouldbe anthems as bands try to repeat the feat of the rebirth brass band whose infectious brassfunk number “do watcha wanna” exploded during carnival  thus the carnival songbook is continually expanded and reinvented helping fuel a brisk business in releasing the mardi gras equivalent of christmasmusic anthologies as long as there have been parades dances and balls in new orleans there has been a steady demand for musicians “carnival by providing the audience the money and the forum in which to develop music and musicians helped create the new orleans music tradition” historian reid mitchell in his book all on a mardi gras day episodes in the history of new orleans carnival harvard university press  points out an  invitation to the ball of the two well known gentlemenan infamous affair catering to the new orleans underworld it was frequented by “sporting men” prostitutes and even women of “good standing” who took advantage of the anonymity afforded by the mask — photo courtesy of the louisiana state museum new orleans was a ballmad city long before there were organized carnival parades french and spanish colonizers reveled at fancydress and masquerade balls in the s as the carnival season of merriment became more established impresarios staged public balls catering to various strata of society while uppercrust creoles held rounds of private balls in which kings and queens were selected and courtly rituals observed “the idea was to get in as much fun as possible before lent” explains henry a kmen inmusic in new orleans louisiana state university press   “and in new orleans fun meant dancing ‘from the very commencement of the carnival’ wrote one onlooker ‘there was no thought of no occupation no interest in anything except dancing’ this observer counted as many as eleven balls on a single evening listened to nightlong music on every street corner and concluded that at this time of the year no man in new orleans was ‘his own master he must belong body and soul to the ballroom’ ” the fact that “new orleans was replete with ballrooms unsurpassed in size and splendor anywhere” according to kmen sparked spirited competition for patrons “but the ballroom proprietor who perhaps showed the most ingenuity was the owner of the jefferson ballroom in  he turned his masked balls into gassed balls by giving ‘exhilarating gas’ nitrous oxide to the dancers… all to the accompaniment of ‘good music’ ” musicians had to be exceptionally versatile to accommodate a dizzying variety of dances steps kmen mentions boleros gavottes cotillions gallops waltzes mazurkas reels and minuets “to say nothing of the everpresent french and english quadrilles…” but without a doubt notes dance scholar jennifer atkins in her  florida state university phd dissertation setting the stage dance and gender in oldline new orleans carnival balls  –  the waltz was the most popular carnival ball dance in the latter half of the thcentury “sexually enticing encounters on the dance floor were enhanced by the trancelike abandon of the waltz” she writes “men and women were drawn to each other through the sheer centrifugal force of their dancing” she cites a report in the new orleans daily picayuneabout the  mistick krewe of comus ball it rhapsodizes about dervishlike women in “dreamy embraces through the mazes of mysterious terpsichorean figures” while “delightful music lulled their senses into delicious bliss” amidst “brilliant costumes worth a world of money” and an “enchanted display of magnificence and royal splendor” music has always been integral to choreographed elements of carnival balls royal entrance performance of tableaux court presentation promenade and grand march evocative of ceremonial displays of royal pomp in old europe the grand march in context of a carnival ball is a symbolic affirmation of elevated status  — a regal display worthy of the assembled guests’ admiration the epitome of this ritual occurs at the meeting of the courts on mardi gras night when rex and comus in a display of opulent pageantry escort each other’s queens around the ballroom they waive their scepters in acknowledgment of the approbation of their “subjects” while the orchestra plays the grand march from the opera aida rex and consort serve as the de facto king and queen of carnival and their ball entrance is always accompanied by the formal cadences of the original carnival theme song “if ever i cease to love” originally published in london in  according to the  edition of arthur hardy’s mardi gras guide it was written by george leybourne who also wrote “the man on the flying trapeze” and popularized in america by a british singer lydia thompson who coincidentally performed in new orleans during mardi gras  it is a silly but catchy ditty whose lyrics include the line “may the moon be turned to green cream cheese if ever i cease to love” the  king of carnivalreigning over a kingdom with a sentimental attachment to the song “if ever i cease to love” stoking anticipation for the  debut of rex whose parade would became the focal point of daytime festivities on mardi gras the new orleans times published tongueincheek edicts and tidbits dispatched from his mythical realm on mount olympus one article noted that he was a bachelor who believed matrimony “should not be entered into until experience has sobered the liveliness of youth and all the wild oats have been sewn” indeed hearts were all aflutter in his mysterious kingdom where according to the article ladies were “already overwhelming his majesty… “it is well to note in the latter connection that the national air or anthem of the carnival dynasty for many centuries past has been as is at present ‘if ever i cease to love’ ” rex’s adoption of the song may have been prompted in part by the highly anticipated visit to new orleans of real royalty on a tour of america russian grand duke alexis romanoff had supposedly become smitten with thompson after having seen her perform the song in a popular musical comedy called blue beard he was a guest of honor at the inaugural rex parade seated at gallier hall on st charles avenue according to the rex organization website “legend has long romantically linked the grand duke with the singer and suggested that “if ever i cease to love” was performed for the grand duke because of his romantic interest in miss thompson while this is a good story it is probably not quite true bands performed the russian national anthem for the grand duke and when rex dismounted on canal street to review the parade the bands played “if ever i cease to love” “if ever i cease to love” has received jazz treatments from the likes of clarinetist george lewis and his original zenith brass band edmond “doc” souchon and johnny wiggs and his new orleans kings a version of the song akin to what’s played at the rex ball can be heard on the album jimmy maxwell and his orchestra at the mardi gras ball charmaine neville of the famous new orleans music family includes a soulinflected rendition on her album queen of the mardi gras while guitarist john rankin offers a lilting solo acoustic version on the album fess’ mess nevertheless despite often being referred to as the “anthem of carnival” it hasn’t been recorded or included on genre compilation albums nearly as often as other songs that would become classics of the carnival canon if the music played at carnival balls in the th century reflected mostly a european sensibility as required by the preferred styles of dance the sounds heard in streets were taking on a more polyglot complexion long before the swinging polyrhythms known today as new orleans jazz materialized in the early decades of the th century the crescent city was a crucible of musical crossfertilization what would eventually come to be known as “creole” music was an expression of this blending of african native american caribbean french and spanish influences the early brass were a reflection of this “creolization” playing  a medley of popular and folk songs dirges and military marches along with quadrilles and other classical forms in the late s the city had over  brass bands most of which were affiliated with fraternal orders fire companies militia companies as well as various social and benevolent organizations — “mutualaid” societies created to fund medical funeral and burial services for duespaying members in his book mitchell notes that in celebrating mardi gras around the turn of the century “white maskers hired black bands to ride with them in spring wagons providing music for their dancing” these horse or muledrawn wagons were forerunners of the bandwagons found in today’s carnival parades not long after louis armstrong came into the world and began soaking up the sounds of the crescent city jazz animated carnival parades mardi gras explains mitchell “did not ‘create’ jazz it did however reflect the reasons new orleans would become the birthplace of jazz…” or as parade designer and carnival historian henri schindler puts it in his book mardi gras new orleans flammarion  “the joyous license of the music owes more than a passing acquaintance to the liberties of mardi gras and a population longaccustomed to dancing in the streets” louis armstrong reigning over the  zulu paradearmstrong played in the zulu parade as a young man and can be heard on king oliver’s “zulu’s ball” released in  it became the first in an evolving canon of recordings that pay homage to the iconic social aid and pleasure club — photo courtesy of the louisiana state museum in his autobiography satchmo my life in new orleans prenticehall  armstrong recounts having had the misfortune of stopping for a beer at a barroom that was near the scene of gunshots wrongly suspected of being a culprit he was briefly incarcerated released from prison on fat tuesday armstrong ran into the zulu social aid and pleasure club parade “it’s a funny thing how life can be such a drag one minute and a solid sender the next” he writes “when i ran into this celebration and the good music i forgot all about sore dick the dreaded prison yard captain and the parish prison” he went on to note that the zulus “march to the good jumping music of brass bands while the king on his thrown scrapes and bows to the cheering crowds” zulu itself can be seen as a reflection of rollicking improvisational aesthetic that would come to characterize what we now know as traditional new orleans jazz instead of scripted decorum of the old blueblood carnival krewes the zulus offered the exuberance and spontaneity of the second line whereby spectators musicians parade marchers and even float raiders would — to borrow a phrase from armstrong — “pitch a boogiewoogie” second lining grew out of traditional africanamerican parades — specifically jazz funerals strictly speaking the “second line” refers to the secondary mass of people — uninvited guests whom everyone expects to show up — who join in the processions following behind the hearse mourners and brass band ie the “first line” before arriving at the cemetery the band plays solemn dirges but after the services when the procession is a respectable distance away from the sacred space the musicians celebrate the life of the deceased by bursting into uptempo parade bounces the distance between the performers and the audience breaks down as the second liners engulf the band moving to the beat as bodies strut and gyrate as handkerchiefs wave and fancy umbrellas twirl it is the role of the grand marshal whose accouterments may include a staff and a whistle to regulate the tempo of the procession note however that in the context of mardi gras parades the grand marshal is more often than not an honorary role featuring a local or in the case of the krewe of endymion and krewe of orpheus national celebrity sylvester francis of the backstreet cultural museum with mardi gras indian suits by victor harris of the mandingo warriors in the backgroundthe “irresistibly funky” cadence of the secondline beat underlies many of the greatest songs in the carnival music canon more generally the term denotes a parade involving a brass band mardi gras indians or secondline club it’s also the name for a style of dancing inspired by the distinctive syncopated rhythm associated with new orleansstyle processions sylvester francis proprietor of the backstreet cultural museum in the tremé neighborhood elaborates “in a general sense” he relates in a script for one of his exhibits illuminating local culture “ ‘a second line’ beat refers to the many syncopated rhythms heard in new orleans jazz and rb as a song moves along there are slight differences in rhythmic emphasis from one measure to the next creating a looseyettight pushandpull feeling that is irresistibly funky more specifically a second line beat is also defined as an accent that falls between the fourth and final beat of one measure and the first beat of the following measure — bomp bomp bomp bomp babomp — that helps to propel a strutting uptempo song two popular examples are the brassband standard “it ain’t my fault” written by smokey johnson and wardell quezergue in  and joe avery’s classic “second line” recorded in the s” both songs are beloved staples of the carnival songbook on the most fundamental level it all goes back to africa in the documentary jazz parades the late folklorist alan lomax notes the similarities between secondline parades and traditional parades in west africa where the band is an integral part of the dancing crowd “you see it in the crouching sliding steps in the improvisation of the dancers most prominently in the change of level from low to high and back again which is so characteristic of africa” he observes in colonial times in new orleans the focal point of afrocaribbean musical and dancing culture was the place des negres later renamed congo square where slaves were allowed to gather on sundays until it was suppressed around  congo square was a public market and venue for communal drumanddance convocations providing continuity for african forms of festive merriment that nurtured the creation of secondline parades and jazz the percussive rhythms and callandresponse chants that drove the revelry entered the vernacular of new orleans music yielding a primal undercurrent that would later become the foundation of funk the key conduits of the congo square drumanddance tradition are mardi gras indians — africanamericans and mixedrace celebrants who “mask indian” slaves and native americans intermingled from the earliest days of colonial louisiana they shared similar belief systems involving ceremonial communion with ancestral spirits and both groups had in common the experience of being subjugated by the dominant culture as racial repression intensified in the postreconstruction era hardening the color line governing participation in the carnival organized groups of mardi gras indians as they came to be known took to the streets on fat tuesday by masking indian they expressed ritual freedom provided continuity to afrocentric forms of festive performance and paid homage to tribes that provided refuge to runaway slaves offering temporary escape from rigidly defined roles and boundaries carnival allowed new orleanians of african descent to symbolically reclaim the festive space of congo square “the indians would never have entered the folk streams of new orleans music had it not been for carnival” conclude coauthors jason berry jonathan foose and tad jones in up from the cradle of jazz new orleans music since world war ii da capo press  the guardians of the flame cultural arts collective accompanied by percussionist bill summers far left on mardi gras combining music dance and elaborate costuming the mardi gras indian tradition is a conduit for cultural retention bringing communities together to interpret their past express ritual freedom and honor their ancestors the music of mardi gras indian tribes or “gangs” can be characterized as “call and response” with the lead singer backed by a chorus and percussion generally speaking their songs celebrate acts of bravery and defiance “we won’t bow down” as well as the proud heritage of the indian nations lyrics include coded chants such as “tu way pocky way” “oom bah way” “mighty kootiefiyo” and “coochee marlee” financed in part with a grant from the national endowment for the arts maruice martinez a new orleans creole produced the first documentary on mardi gras indiansthe black indians of new orleans in  now a professor of education at the university of north carolina he has delved into the origins and mysteries of mardi gras indian vernacular which is derived in part from creole patois at a presentation on mardi gras indians at the  new orleans jazz  heritage festival he explained the etymology of the exhortation “coochee marlee” turns out the expression often associated with the mardi gras indian position of spy boy or scout pertains to the legendary seminole chief coacoochee aka wild cat whose many exploits included helping slaves escape bondage creoles having a tendency to eliminate syllables his name was shortened to coochee “so when coochee came along he say ‘follow me to freedom get out of this wretched existence you’re in in this racist south’ ” explained martinez “and of course in creole you don’t say je vais — ‘i go’ — you say ‘me go’ so it’s moi aller not je vais when you say it fast enough it’s ‘marlee’ ” so when african americans would yell “coochie marlee” it referenced the path to freedom related martinez “ ‘coochee’s comin’ man you want to go let’s go’ ” nowadays when a spy boy hollers “coochie marlee” it roughly translates as “here i am let’s go” the reason the expression became associated with the spy boy is that some of the black seminoles in coacoochee’s band became scouts for the us cavalry in a city where culture bubbles up from the streets the lyrics and beats of the mardi gras indians have inspired and informed an extraordinarily diverse range of players from jazz legends jelly roll morton and danny barker to masters of new orleans funk the meters and the neville brothers rhythm and blues professor longhair earl king and james “sugar boy” crawford and even modern jazz donald harrison jr in his memoir under a hoodoo moon the life of dr john the night tripper st martin’s press  rebennack recalls growing up hearing mardi gras indians play “a real funky kind of street music” for his goin’ back to new orleans album released on the warner bros label in  the night tripper assembled a team of local musical luminaries among them howard “smiley” ricks a percussionist and mardi gras indian one of the album’s standout tracks is a thumping rendition of a traditional mardi gras indian song “my indian red” arranged by barker on the cover of the album which pays tribute to the polyglot musical heritage of the crescent city dr john appears in full mardi gras indian regalia an elaborate handsewn suit of plumage and beadwork dr john’s grammywinning goin’ back to new orleans albuma superlative evocation of the crescent city’s polyglot musical heritage the mardi gras indian tradition goes back at least as far as reconstruction though it wasn’t until the s that the sounds associated with that tradition began to be translated into popular music sugar boy crawford’s “jockomo” released on the chess label in  became a jukebox classic and huey “piano” smith used the indian chant “oom bah way tu way pocky way” in the very first line of his hit “don’t you know yockomo” the most enduringly popular song associated with the black indians of new orleans is “big chief” written by the late new orleans guitaristcomposer earl king also the originator of the mardi gras anthem “street parade” the song was first recorded in  for watch records the session included rebennack who later became known as dr john on guitar and professor longhair on piano king whistles and handles the vocals on “big chief part ″ “me big chief me got ’em tribegot my spy boy by my side” considered to be the session’s definitive version king who wrote the song for professor longhair describes its origins in the radio documentary come on baby let the good times roll the story and music of earl king produced by david kunian “it was really about an indian breaking into the commissary and stealing the whiskey out of there in one of those little towns” he relates the song’s title however was inspired by king’s mother a cousin had nicknamed her “big chief” he explains in the documentary because she was a heavy woman who would “go on the warpath” when chores were neglected “big chief” became a signature song for professor longhair and can he heard on crawfish fiesta alligator big chief rhino and house party new orleans style rounder among other albums growing up in new orleans the professor became uniquely attuned to the rhythms of the streets he danced tap on bourbon street and frequently joined in secondline parades beating out rhythms on bottles cans or whatever objects were at hand he later accentuated the swinging marchingband music of street parades in his distinctively percussive piano playing as george winston has noted the “fess” had three basic styles rhumba boogie slow blues and straight calypso “go to the mardi gras” probably his most famous composition is a rhumba boogie that conveys the aural effect of a train ride the narrator of the song is rolling into new orleans for mardi gras — specifically the parade of the zulus fess first cut the song in  for the dallasbased star talent label but that version was never released another version was cut in  by atlantic records but the  ron records version is the keeper “propelled by john boudreaux’s feverish secondline drumming and a scrappy new orleans horn section the song’s festive lyrics and longhair’s melodic whistling make this the unforgettable treatment” writes jeff hannusch in the liner notes for collector’s choice a rounder release dr john who played guitar on the ron session has credited fess with having “put funk into music” and indeed “go to the mardi gras” exemplifies the afrocaribbean sensibility that has shaped the cultural identity of new orleans since the days of congo square professor longhair aided by the likes of conga player alfred “uganda” roberts channeled the primal beat of congo square but it wasn’t until the release of commercial recordings of mardi gras indians that a concentrated form of this new orleans roots music was widely heard outside the mostly black workingclass neighborhoods were the indians performed new orleans keyboardist and pop rb composer willie tee aka wilson turbinton and his brother saxophonist earl turbinton jr had grown up in the midst of mardi gras indians in new orleans’ calliope housing project the willie tee band first played with the wild magnolias mardi gras indians at the tulane jazz festival in  several years later tee assembled a stellar group of local musicians called the new orleans project for a session with the wild magnolias led by theodore emile “bo” dollis and joseph pierre “monk” boudreaux chief of the golden eagles tribe and boyhood friend of dollis’s the wild magnolias released on the polydor label in  combined the chants and funky percussion rhythms of the indians with jazzflavored jamming the followup they call us wild was released in  “the blend of chief bo dollis’ fierce vocals willie tee’s slinky keys earl turbinton’s screaming sax percolating conga from prof longhair collaborator alfred ‘uganda’ roberts and wahwah space guitar from the original of a long line of ‘guitar june’s ‘guitar june’ johnson jr results in an absolutely flawless longform funk” writes roger hahn in offbeat adding that “the mostly original song list is steeped in terrific tunes based on subjects derived from black indian culture ‘new suit’ ‘fire water’ ‘injuns here we come’ ‘new kind of groove’ ‘we’re gonna party’ it may have been a shortlived experiment but on they call us wild the blending of black indian culture and the emerging genre of funk reaches a rarified pinnacle of popular musical expression” they call us wild originally a europeonly release remained something of an underground legend until being rereleased on polygram in  a longawaited new album life is a carnival reuniting bo dollis and the wild magnolias with monk boudreaux appeared on the metro blue label in spring  it included are four new songs by special guest dr john as well as a rendition of his anthem “mardi gras day” robbie robertson is featured on the title tune taken from the songbook of his old group the band other guests include bruce hornsby cyril neville marva wright and davell crawford “the wild magnolias” broke new ground by fusing mardi gras indian music with more popular idioms but the most influential mardi gras indian recording of all time is the wild tchoupitoulas released in  by island records it marked the first time that the neville brothers — art charles cyril and aaron — came together as an ensemble they united behind their uncle the late george landry who was the driving force behind the project better known as big chief jolly he led the wild tchoupitoulas an uptown tribe a former merchant seaman uncle jolly played blues piano banged out rhythms on the tambourine and spun lyrics from mardi gras indian street lore the wild tchoupitoulas is described in up from the cradle of jazz as “one of the great musical statements issued from new orleans a remarkable fusion of street chants and folk rhythms set to brilliant instrumental and percussive backing” laying down the slippery grooves the meters the seminal funk outfit founded by keyboardistcomposer art “poppa funk” neville back in  at the tender age of  neville as leader of the hawketts achieved jukebox immortality when he did the vocals on “mardi gras mambo” one of the most popular mardi gras tunes of all time the song was recorded again in  by the meters on their fire on the bayou album a year after the release of the wild tchoupitoulas  the meters disbanded and art joined forces with his brothers chief jolly died in  but his spirit lives on in the funky rhythms and soulful vocal harmonies of the neville brothers in their live performances especially during carnival the nevilles like to tip their hats to uncle jolly and the indians by playing songs such as “brother john” “iko iko” and “new suit” chief jolly figures prominently in two cuts on the nevilles’ grammywinning  release on am records yellow moon “wild injuns” an original song is a rambunctious tribute to “mardi gras injuns down in new orleans” and in a reworking of ap carter’s gospel classic “will the circle be unbroken” cyril neville mourns the passing of his beloved uncle undertaker undertaker won’t you please drive real slowthat’s chief jolly that you carryi sure hate to see him go dr martin luther king jr charter school band in the new orleans saints super bowl victory parade aka lombardi grasfor new orleanians the paradetime beats of high school marching bands are inextricably associated with the excitement of carnival over the years the brass band tradition has proven no less of a wellspring of mardi gras music than the mardi gras indian tradition many of the city’s top horn players started out playing in mardi gras parades no matter how spectacular the floats a parade isn’t a parade without the rhythmic excitement of the bands “when i used to go to mardi gras parades” stanton moore recalled in offbeat “the first thing you’d hear coming down the street was the drums i would get so excited i think that funk music just gives you that same feel that rhythmic feel that makes you go ‘oh yeah here it comes’ ” moore is the drummer for new orleans funk band galactic as the authors of up from the cradle of jazz point out “new orleans music is built from the bottom up drums first bass second then guitar and horns” “in new orleans roots music” dr john relates in his memoir “the drummer is crucial chronic to our thing because he lays down the foundation of what new orleans music is all about the funk” the new orleans drummer he adds “leans heavily on the bass drum playing doubleclutch rhythms” and breaking up the beat into “twoandfourbar patterns and sometimes even an eightbar pattern” as dr john recounts in liner notes new orleans session drummer nonpareil earl palmer had a name for this new orleans style of syncopation ” ‘let’s play a little funky butt’ he’d say that’s exactly what it was music to make you dance and shake your butt until your butt is funky” historian mitchell notes in his book that trombonist kid ory a major force in jazz in the first half of the century “won the secondliners over with his version of ‘funky butt’ a ‘ratty’ song” in the early s ory once played at a notorious venue in the uptown redlight district ie black storyville popularly known as funky butt hall it was also the first place louis armstrong heard the music later called jazz culture bearer extraordinaire danny barkerthe mardi gras music tradition has benefited greatly from the brass band revival he set in motion — photo by pat jolly mardi gras music has received a tremendous boost from the brass band revival movement that has been going on in new orleans since the early s it all began after the late danny barker — a banjo and guitar player who worked with everyone from jelly roll morton and bunk johnson to cab calloway benny carter and lucky millinder — returned to his native new orleans from new york and started the fairview baptist church band to turn young people onto the classic brass band tradition out of that came the dirty dozen brass band a key force in reviving the streetparade tradition the dozen mingled an improvisational style of traditional jazz with bebop funk and rb — and thus inspired a new generation to pick up horns and evolve the music in new directions most of the members of the rebirth brass band were in high school when the band started out in the mids they got their break in  after the release of their first album on rounder the year before the title song “do whatcha wanna” became a big smash with the young latenight crowd after club djs started spinning it between hiphop and rap numbers the song with a throbbing tuba bass line and a chorus shouted like a mardi gras indian chant “do watcha wanna…do watcha waaana” got picked up by black commercial radio and became a local hit something no brass band had ever achieved blasting from car stereos jukeboxes and front porches all over the city it became the party theme song for the  carnival season just about every carnival season since has brought new wouldbe anthems though none has hit as big as “do watcha wanna” “indian princess” written by j monque’d was released in early  and quickly became the single for that year’s festivities against rolling rhythms reminiscent of “go to the mardi gras” the late rb diva marva wright trading vocal leads with monque’d sings of a princess turned queen “i’m a big queen jukin’ and jumpin’ “ the chorus features the creole wild west mardi gras indians two years later “gimme my money back” by the treme brass band emerged as a mardi gras anthem mardi gras songs usually reflect the musical sensibility of the era in which they’re written the rhythms of modern urban culture inform young guardians of the flames’s  release new way pockey way first tribe records the title track is a traditional mardi gras indian song infused with funk and elements of hip hop members of the harrison family figure prominently in the young guardians which is an extension of the guardians of the flame donald harrison sr the late big chief of the guardians tribe contributed vocals and lyrics on new way pockey way son donald harrison jr one of the premiere jazz saxophonists of his generation arranged four of the songs jazz drummer idris muhammad left and saxophonist donald harrison jr masking as the congo nation on carnival day the onceobscure music and traditions of mardi gras indians synthesizing african caribbean and american folkways are now emblazoned on the aesthetic and cultural consciousness of new orleans and beyond donald jr is responsible for the groundbreaking album indian blues released in  on the candid label featuring dr john smiley ricks and the guardians of the flame it synthesizes mardi gras indian music and modern jazz in an interview with offbeat harrison recalled how the idea for the album came to him when he was masking indian with his father’s tribe “i had this magical revelation one mardi gras” he relates “i was hearing how the indian music and jazz could be merged together i was hearing the swing beat in the indian music” it’s no wonder that musicians are drawn to mardi gras and its fabled cornucopia of sensory stimuli in a way the exuberant kaleidoscope of mardi gras is a metaphor for the crosspollination and collaboration that characterizes the local music scene in liner notes for ain’t no funk like no funk a compilation of contemporary new orleans funk davis rogan recalled his experience marching with krewe of jewlu on mardi gras  jewlu is a carnival club founded in  by the new orleans klezmer allstars “everyone in purple afro wigs weird glasses silk and sequined costumes drinking their beer and wine…in addition to members of the klezmers mas mamones the iguanas royal finger bowl and it turns out nonnew orleans artists including leftover salmon glove’s special sauce and blues traveler there were members of galactic walter wolfman washington’s roadmasters all that iris may tango flavor kings smilin’ myron brides of jesus new world funk ensemble and the nightcrawlers “it’s that kind of tight music scene down here…” adds davis who plays keyboards for all that “the birthplace of jazz new orleans is the greatest musical mecca on the planet” mardigrastraditionscom all things mardi gras in new orleans microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser
