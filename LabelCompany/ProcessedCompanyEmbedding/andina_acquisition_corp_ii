have been paid from the funds we borrowed from b luke weil described below these funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us if we determine not to proceed with the offering such amounts would not be repaid  no discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the private rights  the funds held in the trust account will be used to acquire a target business to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account and potentially to pay our expenses relating thereto including a fee payable to earlybirdcapital equal to  of the gross proceeds raised in this offering upon consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business combination our expenses relating to the acquisition of a target business would either come from the funds held in the trust account or additional funds otherwise available to us outside of the trust account including cash held by the target business any remaining funds will be disbursed to the combined company and be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business  the amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at  even if the overallotment is exercised in addition interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account after payment of taxes owed on such interest income will be available to us to pay for our working capital requirements we estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  over a month period assuming an interest rate of approximately  per year  these are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would be deducted from our excess working capital our initial shareholders and earlybirdcapital have agreed that they and their respective designees will purchase an aggregate of  private units at a price of  per unit  in the aggregate in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering they have further agreed that if the overallotment option is exercised by the underwriters they will purchase from us at a price of  per unit an additional number of private units up to a maximum of  private units pro rata with the amount of the overallotment option exercised so that at least  per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether the overallotment option is exercised in full or part all of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below  or  if the overallotment option is exercised in full of net

agreement the funds held in trust will be invested only in united states government treasury bills bonds or notes having a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under rule a promulgated under the investment company act of  and that invest solely in united states government treasuries so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act except with respect to i interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations and ii any remaining interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital requirements the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation the proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business other than the payment of consulting fees to our officers directors shareholders or their affiliates for assisting us in consummating our initial business combination in an amount not to exceed an aggregate of  no compensation of any kind including finder’s consulting or other similar fees will be paid to any of our existing officers directors shareholders or any of their affiliates prior to or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of the business combination regardless of the type of transaction that it is however such individuals will receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after a business combination regardless of whether the overallotment option is exercised in full the net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately  of which  will be paid by us on closing of this offering to b riley  co as described herein in addition the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account after payment of taxes owed on such interest income may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination we intend to use the excess working capital available for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence legal accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates as well as for reimbursement of any outofpocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above we will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe we intend to use the aftertax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence legal accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates as well as for reimbursement of any outofpocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below the allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds in the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so or the amount of interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the current low interest rate environment we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering including the funds held in the trust account to acquire a target business to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto including a fee payable to b riley  co of  upon consummation of this offering to provide us with certain advisory services in connection with our initial business combination and a fee payable to earlybirdcapital equal to  of the gross proceeds raised in this offering exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable upon consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business combination as described under the section titled “underwriting — business combination marketing agreement” if the payment of our liabilities including the fee payable to earlybirdcapital were to reduce the amount available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account we would not be able to consummate such transaction to the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination to pay holders who wish to convert their shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses relating thereto which could include the up to  payable to earlybirdcapital described above if the overallotment option is exercised in full will be disbursed to the combined company and will along with any other net proceeds not expended be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations for strategic acquisitions and for marketing research and development of existing or new products to the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination we will pay the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of the trust account if such funds are insufficient b luke weil has agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation currently anticipated to be no more than  and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses as of august   b luke weil had advanced to us an aggregate of  to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for a portion of the legal expenses the advances are payable without interest on the date on which we consummate our initial public offering the advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses if we determine not to proceed with the offering such amounts would not be repaid in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering until completion of an initial business combination our initial shareholders officers and directors or their affiliates may but are not obligated to loan us funds from time to time or at any time in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion the notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination without interest or at the lender’s discretion up to  of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of  per unit which for example would result in the holders being issued  ordinary shares if  of notes were so converted as the rights included in the units would result in an additional  shares being issued as well as  warrants to purchase  shares our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination if we do not complete our initial business combination the loans would not be repaid a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account including interest earned on his her or its portion of the trust account to the extent not previously released to us only in the event of i our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required time period or ii if that public shareholder converts such public shares or sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection with a business combination which we consummate or in connection with an amendment to our memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of an initial business combination in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources the following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses • our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion ofa transaction • our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination • nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination • our outstanding rights warrants and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent • our obligation to pay earlybirdcapital a fee of  of the gross proceeds of this offering upon consummation of our initial business combination • our obligation to either repay or issue private rights upon conversion of up to  of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders officers directors or their affiliates • our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares as well as the private rights and underlying securities and any securities issued to our initial shareholders officers directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans and • the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms furthermore the fact that we will not be required to pay our underwriters any deferred compensation upon consummation of an initial business combination may give us a competitive advantage over other similarly structured blank check companies if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business we cannot assure you that subsequent to a business combination we will have the resources or ability to compete
