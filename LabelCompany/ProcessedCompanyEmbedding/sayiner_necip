sponsored content oct   the growing sophistication of modern electronic systems is driving increasingly tighter power supply specifications and requiring more intelligent power control methods the switch to digital power control will happen gradually but it will happen our job as silicon suppliers is to enable the transition by offering enhanced tools that meld the analog and digital worlds together to design more capable higher performance power supplies properly engineered digital power can deliver a lower total cost of ownership higher system reliability with predictive fault correction and the ability for remote diagnosis and configuration—all tangible benefits for the customer silicon laboratories’ digital power solutions leverage our superior mixedsignal expertise to deliver solutions that enhance power system performance flexibility and reliability while reducing system size and cost with proprietary digital control isolation and highvoltage technologies silicon laboratories’ innovative digital power product portfolio delivers exactly what the next generation of power hardware architectures need by definition a digital power controller performs all system control algorithms in the digital domain it converts all analog system parameters to digital and uses this data to compute control response entirely in the digital domain then writes the updated control information back into the system any controller doing less than this is “digitally assisted” the precise algorithmic nature of digital control enables more advanced control algorithms for increased system performance its high integration delivers small size and lowcost control solutions and its programmability enables hardware platform standardization with software customization for greater manufacturing efficiencies and faster time to market while the power supply designer is working to create more accurate faster responding more efficient and smaller supplies with each endproduct generation cost is also a key element that said system cost is more than just the bill of materials other tangible costs such as manufacturing labor and overhead customer support and warranty returns must be included in any analog “breakeven” analysis to this end digital power control has a longterm cost advantage over its analog control counterparts due to higher integration and the cost savings resulting from the use of commodity digital ic fabrication technology necip sayiner serves as president and ceo of silicon laboratories and is a member of the board of directors necip

results provided in todays earnings press release i will now turn the call over to intersil president and ceo necip sayiner necip sayiner thanks shannon and hello everyone second quarter results reflect a major turning point for our business with revenue of  million in q we grew yearoveryear and both cc and ii were up yearoveryear for the first time in five years strong gross margin lower opex compared to a year ago and improved operating margin are creating even greater leverage a trend we expect to continue with the business in better health and on a growth path we are staying focused on executing to our strategy of dominating key markets with our power management technology throughout the turnaround we’ve been buffeted by end market ups and downs our largest end market industrials is slowly yet steadily recovering from the weakness in the second half of  while automotive continues to be a bright spot those two end markets comprised about half of our revenue today so the improved outlook is encouraging there are still things out of our control that can impact the pace of our recovery in a multispeed demand environment like this the key to success for us continues to be productcycledriven market share gain the recent strength in our business reflects ramps of new products as we enjoy the first of three anticipated growth rate with q bookings and qs starting backlog at the highest we have seen in the last eight quarters we are set up to deliver a growth year in  and importantly we are continuing to make real progress towards achieving our target model with gross margin forecasted to be at  and operating margins improving again in q i will provide more detail on the specifics of our business after rick reviews the financial results rick rick crowley thank you necip second quarter gaap results include  million for impairment of fixed assets and  million in restructuring and related charges associated with the plan announced last month to shutdown the millimeter line at our fab in florida the investment in the millimeter line was undertaken to extend the production life for certain products manufactured at ibm when the supply commitments were set to expire at the end of  in july  global foundries acquired the ibm fabs and recently decided to continue longterm manufacturing support for our products to avoid future capital investment to maintain our millimeter line we determined it would be beneficial to our longterm cost structure to source manufacturing for these products from global foundries we will continue to support our inch and inch manufacturing lines at our internal fab which provides about  of our total wafer requirements now for the remainder of the gaap results gaap gross margin for the second quarter was up again to  a  basis point sequential increase total second quarter operating expenses increased on a sequential basis to  million with rd investment of  million sga expense of  million and other charges of  million gaap operating income declined sequentially to  million or  of revenue q gaap net income was  million resulting in earnings per share of  for the third quarter we anticipate the production transfer will result in an additional restructuring charge to gaap results of approximately  million to  million on a nongaap basis second quarter gross margin improved once again rising to  this improvement was driven by an increased mix of ii revenue and within ii particular strength of our aerospace products we expect q gross margin will increase again as we benefit from higher revenue and a favorable mix of new products within cc the decommissioning of our internal millimeter line will also provide a modest nearterm benefit to gross margin and we expect a further  basis points to  basis points benefit in the long run from the reduction in fixed costs q operating expenses were up sequentially by  million to  million but were below yearago levels rd investment was  million and sga expense was  million we expect operating expenses to be down sequentially in q as we benefit from cost reduction efforts and the absence of nonrecurring expenses in q related to technology development and sales training we believe the changes weve made to the companys overall cost structure will result in significant earnings leverage and prove to be an inflection point in the trajectory to achieving our nongaap financial model of  gross margin and  operating margin q nongaap operating income increased sequentially and year over year to  million operating margin was  in the second quarter an improvement of  basis points sequentially and  basis points yearoveryear the second quarter nongaap effective tax rate was  nongaap net income increased  sequentially and  year over year to  million in q resulting in nongaap earnings per share of  in q we expect our nongaap tax rate will be in the range of  to  turning now to the balance sheet quarter ending cash and cash equivalents increased to  million accounts receivable balances increased by about  million sequentially although days sales outstanding were consistent with historical averages at  days onhand inventory levels increased ending at  million or  days this increase resulted from a buffer inventory build related to the manufacturing transition we talked about excluding the approximately  million buffer build our inventory would have been down sequentially we do expect our inventory will begin declining again q free cash flow remained solid and we returned  million to shareholders through our highyielding dividend im encouraged by the strong results in q and believe based on our current outlook that we can make significant progress toward achieving our longterm gross and operating margin targets in the second half of this year necip necip sayiner thank you rick lets start with our cc business which exceeds yearoveryear growth for the third consecutive quarter cc represented  of company revenue and was down  sequentially due to anticipated weakness in our consumer business youll remember that last quarter we talked about new tablet brands resulting in indiscernible in q which is consistent with how the quarter played out while our customers innovative new platforms have been successful the forecast has moderated recently but we expect that as those platforms become dominant within their sales mix we will continue to benefit partially offsetting q tablet demand is strong adoption in new platforms at leading smartphone customers like huawei where we are expanding our footprint into more models computing revenue was down slightly sequentially and up about  yearoveryear skylake adoption has been steadily increasing which is reflected in the yearoveryear improvement we should see some acceleration into q which will allow the computing business to grow sequentially combined we expect the cc business to be up mid singledigits sequentially in q ii revenue grew a strong  sequentially in q and represented  of company revenue ii also increased modestly yearoveryear as a result of strength across the various product lines ill start with industrial analog which represented  of company revenue and was up sequentially by  this business was the hardest hit last year when the industrial market slowed and q revenue was still behind by more than  compared to the same quarter last year however bookings are slowly but consistently improving and we expect to close the gap further as we go into q automotive remained near record levels representing  of revenue demand is robust across both power and video applications where expanding content is providing a strong growth opportunity we continue to win with power products in the cabin managing power in the infotainment console for example were also anticipating increasing share under the hood in hybrid and electric vehicles in q we introduced a very competitive battery pack monitor that in combination with our battery manager allows customers to achieve the highest safety integrity level we have also been investing in technologies to intersect the trends in automotive display laser headsup displays are the latest innovation in the advanced driver assistance systems they project speed warning signals and other vehicle and navigation information on the windshield directly in the drivers line of sight we recently introduced a device for headsup display systems that pulses four highintensity lasers to project full hd color video onto the windshield our higher current and faster switching speed enables high resolution displays for nextgeneration vehicles and adds to our content opportunity in automotive aerospace revenue was at record levels as well in q representing  of revenue the increase in the quarter was a result of a large order from a longstanding aerospace customer we also continue to expand the portfolio to increase our content our latest new product offers the industrys highest signalprocessing performance for data critical to communications satellites this is a lumpy but very high margin business and while we expect it to decline from this level sequentially in q customer engagement remains high ii power which was  of company revenue was up again sequentially power modules continue to be a strong area for us as we penetrate both large oems and expand our presence in this channel we added to the portfolio again in q with amp and amp power modules that offer industryleading metrics on both density and efficiency for batterypowered applications growth trends are favorable again as we go into q with power modules expected to make a sizeable step up in revenue with good dynamics across the board in our ii business we expect revenue to be slightly up sequentially in q taking a balanced view of end market demand in q we are expecting total revenue in the range of  million to  million at the midpoint of the guidance this represents about a  yearoveryear increase with similar percentage growth in both cc and ii we believe gross margin will be up  basis points achieving our  target nongaap operating expenses are expected to decrease and be in the range of  million to  million we anticipate gaap earnings of  to  per share earnings per share on a nongaap basis excluding amortization restructuring and stock compensation are expected to be  to  with that well take your questions shannon pleasant thank you necip wed now like to open the call for questions operator please review the qa instructions with the call participants questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ross seymore of deutsche bank your line is open matt diamond hey good afternoon guys this is actually matt diamond on ross behalf the first question i have is that we knew that there are  basis points to  basis points of expansion from the palm bay shuttering could you give us sort of a timeframe when you expect that to happen is there an inflection point or a hockey stick or is it just literally a step up from quarter to quarter from here rick crowley its a we said longterm benefit we meant that it probably is going to be realized in  months to  months that additional  basis points to  basis points matt diamond okay and the cc sort of the longerterm outlook beyond q is there anything to call out beyond normal seasonality there necip sayiner i think that the demand we are seeing in our consumer business for q is certainly subseasonal in my judgement i think we will start seeing some return to normal patterns in that business as well as adding the new layer of design wins in consumer that weve been talking about heading into  the computing side of cc as i remarked is showing continued improvement as the percentage of skylake platforms are steadily increasing and we expect that to continue well into  matt diamond okay excellent and last one the same question in auto any directional impact for the second half of the year necip sayiner we are expecting yet another record quarter in q in our automotive business i think its a little too early to call out q but we dont see anything in the horizon that will shake the strength in that business its going very very strong for us at the moment matt diamond all right excellent thanks so much guys and congrats again necip sayiner thank you operator thank you our next question is from cody acree of drexel hamilton your line is open cody acree thanks guys for taking my questions and congratulations on the yearoveryear growth necip maybe if we can start there and just your level of visibility you mentioned that some of the consumer programs that you had expected to start to ramp you were digesting some inventory that maybe that demand hadnt come in quite as strong as youd expected can you just talk about whats happening there and maybe what gives you confidence that that starts to pick up maybe later in the year necip sayiner yes we have the platform with the products that we got on tablet platforms we have  share on new platforms so the demand for our products is really a function of the adoption rate of the newer platforms and the customer sales mix as far as the smartphone side of things are concerned we are quite pleased with the continuing proliferation of our products especially in our leading customer into more models they continue adopting our products and so there are some puts and takes we would have expected perhaps the consumer revenue overall to be higher than what were guiding to but i think the important thing is that in spite of that subseasonal trend every other end market that we are addressing is quite strong so we were able to show the revenue growth yearoveryear and earnings leverage cody acree and then necip can you talk about the funnel i guess on the consumer side knowing that these things take quarters to ramp into and i know that youve been working to broaden beyond the current design win set so as we look into  are we looking just a broader portfolio mix within the current oems or how broad a net can you cast so that it doesnt quite depend so much as to one platform or one oems success and you can kind of grow as the market continues to transition necip sayiner yes thats the great question i think there are two elements one is increase of content on the platforms that we have won as we move into their nextgeneration platforms in the next  months to  months so there is going to be a content increase in what we bring to those platforms and secondly we have brought to market some real innovative products earlier this year and we have some major designins for  platforms particularly on the handset side but i think i am going to for now leave it at that and leave the color for subsequent calls cody acree but is that an expansion of the oem base or is that within current customers necip sayiner on the smartphone side its an expansion of the customer base as well as a higher content cody acree perfect and then lastly just if we look maybe beyond skylake and you just look at the computing side of this business as a whole knowing that youre working architectures in the future for intel and maybe the reduction of the competitive landscape the number of competitors do you think that the computing market long term for you can be a growth market or once we get through the skylake transition do you have to suffer the secular declines that maybe were seeing in pcs as a whole necip sayiner you know were not viewing the pc side of our business necessarily as a big growth engine the units will continue to decline on the vcore side we have the asp increase with skylake and the followon two generations also maintain that kind of content the growth for us really comes in computing from battery chargers irrespective of the decline in overall units for our vcore offering the growth later this year and into  and  coming at the heels of adoption of our battery charger offerings where we did not have a very significant share to start with and thats changing positively for us so i would say for the next two three years the dynamics are reasonably good but long term we view it as a declining unit market cody acree good and then im sorry lastly rick not to ignore you obviously could you just talk about your opex expectations given all the programs that youve got to manage and pay for rick crowley yes i think that as were guiding here weve done i think a very good job of managing opex and resetting our opex to a new level here which we expect to sustain and thats going to put us on a trajectory to obtain our target model on the op margin basis of  more quickly than i think anyone including ourselves had been planning to get to and were looking to contain opex as we grow the top line and provide good fallthrough and leverage as we move forward cody acree perfect thank you guys congrats and thanks for the questions operator thank you our next question is from craig ellis of b riley your line is open craig ellis thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the second quarter i wanted to follow up on codys question a little bit and a comment that you made necip regarding the phase i phase ii phase iii of growth it seems like were progressing through phase one pretty nicely here as youre getting sustained yearonyear growth and as you look ahead to the second phase of growth as that broadens out and accelerates can you help convey to us where youve got more visibility and more confidence in the growth thats coming as part of that second phase necip sayiner so there is a  i alluded to with respect to cc we are equally if not more excited about phase two in infrastructure we have been talking about design wins for our digital multiphase product powerstage product for nextgeneration data center infrastructure so that is the indiscernible generation based on skylake architecture just around the corner and were starting to now get forecasts from our earlyadopter customers well start shipping in earnest in the very beginning of  it appears thats a significant step up for us because of the content we bring into that generation of data centers and automotive has been a very bright spot for us this year at this point were looking at somewhere north of  yearonyear growth in that business but there is an inflection yet to come with  and beyond models so thats the phase three weve got good visibility into those programs design wins very intact with our customers so were excited about that potential craig ellis thats helpful thank you and then moving over to rick rick can you just go through some of the dynamics behind the decision on palm bay i think its understandable why you made the millimeter line change one why does it make more sense for you just to stick with the inch and inch and as you make the move on millimeter is there any ancillary benefit to opex that you get or is that purely a cog savings that accrues rick crowley yes craig good question on the inch and inch line the processes were running on these lines are generally proprietary and they produce our very high margin milaero and analog products so when you look at the economics or we look at the economics of it it makes sense to continue where we are with the knowhow and the cost structure because the cost benefit of moving it outside really doesnt play out number one and with respect to the second part of your question yes theres some modest impacts to opex from the reductions and the actions weve taken and thats baked into our guide here for q craig ellis and then the followup to that rick would be that as we look back over the last couple years it seems like you continue to pull a rabbit out of the hat in terms of incremental cost savings that youre able to find as you assess the opportunities to further streamline the cost structure whether its on the manufacturing side or on the opex side how much wiggle room is left is there any low or midhanging fruit or are we fairly well optimized with this manufacturing move rick crowley well i think the mindset we use is always tried to look for improved efficiencies and to try to get costs out that said i think weve gotten the larger items were certainly looking to sustain the investment that it takes to get our new products out and not compromise that so i think thats the main points that we want to get out in response to your question necip sayiner i would also add that i think over the last two three years we have managed to become more efficient with the use of our rd dollars and how the projects are executed on and the amount of it reuse that we can bring to bear so we are actually able to do more with a fixed amount of rd dollars compared to say three years ago craig ellis got it thanks guys operator thank you our next question is from tore svanberg of stifel your line is open tore svanberg yes thank you nice quarter maybe i can ask the opex question a bit differently so with all the merger mania going on in the analog space and now that youre growing your top line again and it does sounds like you have a pretty good funnel as well why actually not go out and hire some experienced engineers instead of just keeping the opex flat necip sayiner well we didnt say we were going to keep the opex flat going forward i think our desire is to continue to grow our rd commensurate with revenue growth i think we have certainly more room to do that in the next  months to  months than weve had thus far in the turnaround and yes there are i think very capable engineers not far from us who are available maybe we can be successful in recruiting them so the desire here is certainly not to continue to plant on opex were going to squeeze all the inefficiency we find in the organization but we want to be in a position to continue investing and growing our product investment tore svanberg thats fair and maybe moving to a more nearterm question so i know  days ago you had pretty strong bookings momentum im just wondering where that stands today i think you did mention bookings were up in the quarter but sort of more from the linearity perspective how are orders trending necip sayiner yes as i mentioned it was the highest order in two years q and that was pretty linear i mean we had  different companies have different schedules on how they book orders et cetera so that can change but for us its been steady throughout q we didnt see any particular difference in terms of linearity it has been i think nicely broad and predictable i would say in terms of weekly bookings rate tore svanberg very good and necip on the industrial business you were talking about a recovery there and closing the gap on the yearoveryear performance is that a reflection of the end market or is it actually some intersilspecific products that are going into production necip sayiner i think that on the margins we might be – let me take it one at a time on analog and power business which is almost all of industrial we have seen a trough in q of last year i think we called that one correctly and both businesses improved in q and q and q is also looking to be flat to up so i would say thats largely end market driven we in the margins have been able to gain some share particularly with our power modules that drove the improvement over those few quarters but im going attribute most of the improvement from q trough to where we are to improving end market demand tore svanberg very good great job guys thank you necip sayiner thank you operator thank you our next question is from ian ing of mkm partners your line is open ian ing yes thank you first of all rick a clarification the palm bay shutdown having a modest nearterm benefit to gross margins how much is that influencing the guidance of  basis points and im assuming its building buffer inventory and running the factories hot right now rick crowley ian no actually its not were actually beginning the ramp down immediately its already begun so its really the taking cost out as quickly as we can this quarter and its very modest its a fairly small portion of the  basis point improvement ian ing okay thats helpful and necip as you look at your server design wins could you talk a bit about the competitive landscape and your sense of server power you know maxim on recent calls also pretty vocal about their data center opportunity  volts and then leading into  volts into next year thanks necip sayiner yes the content we bring with next generation are both controllers based on our digital power technology as well as our smart power stage offering our controllers are capable of supporting both volt and volt topology and the design wins that we have are from both flavors i think we have done a decent job i would say in garnering share for our firstgeneration digital power technology for servers there is certainly growing interest having established ourselves as a player for the refresh and followon generations but we feel pretty good about the level of performance that we can bring to the table in terms of efficiency and transient performance ian ing great and then a question for both of you you have a bit of a highclass problem here as your fundamentals improve your free cash flow return to shareholders is declining im getting  now on a trailing  month basis so my question is is there some sort of minimum threshold where you need to perhaps revisit are you going to look at share buybacks or dividend increases is there some threshold that youre looking at or a place where youd start looking at having that conversation rick crowley well we evaluate on an ongoing basis with the board and we do look at dividend yield and the payout ratio we still have a very high dividend yield and so far through the first half of the year weve paid out  of our free cash flow in the form of a dividend so thats still a pretty high payout ratio i think were probably one of the better in the industries so at this stage theres no immediate plans to change the dividend or we dont have a buyback authorization approved but at the same time we think that our dividend is certainly a very efficient and effective return of capital to shareholders ian ing okay if i could squeeze one more in do you see builds right now do you have a sense of maybe the ratio of skylake versus haswell and broadwell i know at one point you said skylake was still only less than half of the builds necip sayiner i think at this point they have just crossed the  mark with skylake ian ing okay thank you very much necip sayiner thank you rick crowley youre welcome operator thank you our next question is from john pitzer of credit suisse your line is open john pitzer hey good afternoon guys thanks for letting me ask the question let me add my congratulations on return to yearoveryear growth necip a lot of my questions have been answered but im just kind of curious with all the repositioning that you guys have gone through over the last  months to  months you mentioned earlier that you thought your q guide was below seasonal for some specific factors can you just help to levelset us all on the call given where your portfolio is today how you view normal seasonal for q and q on a sequential basis necip sayiner thats a good question so my remark was based on what we would expect q to mean for our consumer platform having won new platforms i would have expected to see a higher sequential growth for us but compared to q of the previous two years it looks of course favorable the last two years cc was down sequentially in q but that is not what i expect from a business that is enjoying product cycles and leading platforms and customers so i think cc should be viewed as a bit of a subpar sequentially in q in terms of ii there is a lot to be pleased about what were seeing in that business today the headwinds in industrial particularly analog have subsided automotive is doing very well milaero is contributing so there is a lot of momentum in general i think were staying flat to slightly up sequentially but thats mostly because we had a stellar quarter in milaero in q john pitzer thats helpful and then necip just that same sort of line of reasoning around a calendar q again with the repositioning what would you expect normal seasonal and if cc is below seasonal for q does that mean you should buck normal seasonal trends in q or how should we think about that necip sayiner yes thats a good question the forecast seems to be moving around more than wed like in some cases so i am going to have to not give a straight answer on q cc because i dont believe we have very good visibility to whether this could be counterseasonal the ii business though in q generally is down particularly for milaero that happens to be the case so if typical seasonal patterns hold again i would expect ii to be lower in q sequentially john pitzer and necip my last question is you guys are well through kind of the turnaround story repositioning story as we get into the third phase of growth what do you think sort of the right organic growth rate for intersil given your product portfolio and i guess more importantly given some of the news we saw earlier in the week of consolidation in the analog space which has never really been a strategic imperative we saw a pretty big deal announced earlier in the week how do you think about consolidation in this space and maybe trying to drive more shareholder value through inorganic growth either as an acquirer or an acquire necip sayiner so ill answer the organic piece i think the target model we set out  months ago to grow the top line at a rate of  is looking more and more concrete to us at this juncture with all the new product rollouts and the design wins that we have been able to garner so i think collectively we have higher confidence in achieving and sustaining that kind of growth and i think our board also shares that confidence and with respect to ma as i said earlier many times it is a fact of life in our industry i think the pace continues to be strong in ma and in a few years time it is difficult to imagine intersil in its current form well either scale up further inorganically by acquiring an attractive business that is strategic to us or we will be under a larger umbrella thats the more likely outcome that is what i said last year and the year before and i continue to believe in that john pitzer thats helpful thanks guys operator thank you our last question is from chris caso of clsa your line is open chris caso yes thank you you guys have discussed a lot of different product areas and product initiatives as we look into  what would you consider to be the most significant areas that we should be watching in terms of what drives the revenue growth as we move into  necip sayiner i think we are going to continue to see improvements in cc a continuation of skylake adoption and proliferation of our products into more platforms in consumer we will see a significant improvement in the infrastructure power business with the rollout of a further generation in  thats quite significant in terms of dollars for us given the content and thirdly automotive continues to be a strong driver of growth for us i dont see that one slowing at all as a matter of fact at this point we are setting our sights on a  million run rate in that business over the next  months chris caso if i could drill down on the automotive just a little bit more and i know you had previously talked about i believe it was model year  design wins on that could you give us a little perhaps an idea of when we might start seeing an acceleration in growth in automotive i mean would that be kind of toward the end of next year or wed have to wait into the calendar  to see that accelerate more or aggressively necip sayiner so there are a few vectors one has to do with the regulation in north america for all vehicles to have backup cameras thats a  requirement so those models who have not yet obliged will need to adopt it and that will start going in our revenues in second half of  with our video products i think the even larger delta comes from some of the new products that we have developed and been able to gain some design wins with large oems that will start in earnest in year  and thirdly our power business has been continuing to grow from a small base over the last two three years its now in the   of our overall revenues for automotive and that continues to grow because weve been investing in that space and creating a lot of new products so i continue to think that this is going to keep layering on so this is where we get the confidence for setting a goal like this chris caso great okay great color thank you very much necip sayiner youre welcome end of qa operator thank you and that concludes our qa session for today i would now like to turn the call back over to shannon pleasant for any further remarks shannon pleasant thank you very much and thank

results provided in today’s earnings press release i will now turn the call over to intersil’s president and ceo necip sayiner necip sayiner thanks shannon and hello everyone first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year that we were anticipating with consistent performance across the board revenue of  million was up  sequentially much better than seasonal norms gross margin increased sequentially operating expenses remains well managed and for the eleventh quarter in a row we achieved  operating income design interaction is the key metric in accessing the health of our revenue in pipeline and our prospects for longterm growth q did not disappoint with the number of design wins up  for the company demand trends have also be improving particularly encouraging as the robust demand we’re observing for ii product as we enter q i’ll provide more detail on the business after rick reviews the financial result rick richard d crowley thank you necip first i’ll summarize the gaap results first quarter gaap gross margin was  a  basis points sequential increase total first quarter operating expenses increased on a sequential basis to  million with rd investment of  million and sga expense of  million gaap operating income increased yearoveryear but declined slightly on a sequential basis to  million or  of revenue the q gaap tax rate was  resulting in net income of  million and earnings per share of  on a nongaap basis first quarter gross margin of  increased by  basis points sequentially this was ahead of our expectations driven by a favorable mix in cc strong automotive performance and lower manufacturing variances days ago we stated that we expected q would be the low point for our utilization and that has proven to be the case with q mix favoring our ii business we expect to see further sequential improvement in gross margin operating expenses were up as anticipated to  million but were still below yearago levels rd activity increased driving investments to  million in q sga expense declined to  million we expect operating expenses to be up again seasonally in q due to our annual raised cycle as well as an increase in new product development cost and some nonrecurring expenses related to technology development and sales training we believe operating expense in the second half of  will be relatively stable to q levels q nongaap operating income increased sequentially to  million or  of revenue the first quarter nongaap effective tax rate was  nongaap net income was  million in q resulting a nongaap earnings per share of  we expect our nongaap tax rate will remain in the  range in q and nongaap share count will be about  million shares turning to the balance sheet quarter ended cash equivalents increased once again to  million account receivable balances increased by  million sequentially and day sales outstanding were consistent with historical averages onhand inventory level declined for the fourth consecutive quarter ending at  million or days q free cash flow remains solid and we returned  million to shareholders through our high yielding dividend in summary q was a very solid quarter with improvements in the demand environment and strong operational execution contributing to an encouraging start to the year necip necip sayiner thank you rick lets start with our cc business which achieved yearoveryear growth for the second consecutive quarter revenue of  million was up over  compared to q  cc represented  of company revenue down  sequentially much better than what is typical of a seasonal first quarter computing revenue declined as expected in q with seasonal trends some of the offset by the transition to skylake skylake adaption has muted the impact of decline in indiscernible because of higher asps but the transition has been slower than what we have experienced in previous generations the mix of skylake did increase during the first quarter but only modestly and the ramp continues at a very measured pace into q we believe this will result in flattish computing revenue in the second quarter on the consumer side business is ontrack with ramps in new model platforms accelerating during the first quarter new product revenue is being driven by leading tablets and common and smartphone wins securing these design wins in the presence of large incumbents demonstrate intersil’s unique capability and growing relationships in the mobile market we are focused on opportunities where we are highly differentiated and customers value to performance we provide we target targets to expand multiple product generations with limited integration threats for example we recently announced the first usbc compliance charger capable of supporting buck and boost mode one to three cells lithium ion batteries in ultra books tablets and power banks the singlechip solution replaces traditional to two chip charger solutions extends battery life and reduces customer bill of material cost by up to  in the nearterm we expect to see some digestion from the strong q and q ramps with resumption of growth in the second half of  taking all of the q dynamics into consideration we expect cc to be down low singledigit sequentially ii revenue grew  sequentially at the high end of our expectations comprising  of company sales and reversing declined that persisted over the last year while its still premature to declare the ii end market is healthy given demand is still below yearago levels the pace of recovery is better than what we had anticipated days ago the biggest success story with ii was a automotive in q which was up  yearoveryear q automotive revenue was another record increasing to  of company revenue we have been focused on building our automotive power portfolio to increase our content for vehicle you can see evidence of that in our new product introductions recently we introduced new automotive boost controllers to support all the amplifier start stop system and head lamp leds they support wide input and output ranges and deliver greater than  efficiency numerous on chip protection features keep the power supply safe under all start up conditions we also introduced a new pin compatible buck regulator family for infotainment head unit and adas application that address the low requirements of single dual and quad core processors this enables part makers to deploy a single footprint for entry level to luxury car model highly reliable and efficient these solutions offer customers a compiling value proposition historically with video decoders alone intersil’s content per vehicle has been about  to  with additional power content in the infotainment console and the cabin the dollar content more than doubled for hybrid electric vehicles where we can provide multi cell balancing as well the content sets up yet again as you can see the automotive business is going to continue to be a very strong element of our longterm growth story in q we expect that continued demand for our video decoders in rear view cameras combined with growing opportunities in china and korea in particular will contribute to further strength ii power which was  of company revenue was also up sequentially for both infrastructure in industrial application i’m pleased with the progress we are making in expanding our portfolio particularly with controller for example we recently introduce new hybrid controller that are based on our hiperformance analog control loop but also incorporates supports for additional interface they are able to deliver better performance in a smaller footprints than competing solutions while offering customers some easier design flow our strategy in ii power has been to intersect key technology transitions to increase our share one such transition is the adoption of digital power conversion in data sets where intersil is one of very few companies has able to help customer rallied measureable power savings this includes both  volt and the latest  volt configurations where we have meaningful design winds in both types of platforms our content is increasing as well we offer both single and multi phase controllers for core and point of load tower as well as new companion smart power savings together this increases our content as much as five volt in several platform that are slated to start shifting early in  moving on to industrial analog which represented  of company revenue we saw sequential improvement here as well growth contributed to both higher utilization and higher margin ii mix support gross margin expansion during the quarter this is a business that much closely follows the macro demand environment so we view the sequential growth as a good sign of improving health in the long cycle market we expect our industrial analog business to continuously improve in the second quarter and lastly aerospace was  of revenue in q and down sequentially which is not a typical of the somewhat lumpy business we expect new wins in aerospace to take off in q and contribute to a return a sequential growth given the positive dynamics we’ve discussed we expect all of the ii sub category automotive power analog and aerospace to be up sequentially in q in total ii is expected to be up mid to high singledigit we’re feeling good about our business given better endmarket dynamic and an increasing proportion of new business driving revenue growth for the second quarter we expect revenue in the range of  million to  million based on a more favorable product mix we believe gross margin will increase by  to  basis points sequentially nongaap operating expenses are expected to be in the range of  million to  million we anticipate gaap earnings of  to  per share earnings per share on a nongaap basis excluding amortization and stock compensation are expected to be  to  with that we’ll take your questions shannon pleasant thank you necip we would now like to open the call for your questions operator please review the qa instructions for the call participants questionandanswer session operator operator instruction and our first question comes from the line of tore svanberg with stifel your line is now open tore svanberg yes thank you and congratulations on the results i guess first of all necip could you talk a little bit about your relative visibility going into q it does sound like the ii is going to be up sequentially but just sort of from a backlog coverage perspective how do you feel about visibility going into the june quarter necip sayiner we have closed the first quarter with a booktobill just over one we have had a pretty stable bookings so far quartertodate we looked at the channel inventory and it remains lean with no noticeable changes from the yearend we are seeing orders come in pretty broadly across all our segments so far everything is pointing to a reasonably good sequential growth for our ii business in q tore svanberg alright good and you talked about design wins being up  that actually is a good proxy for the growth that to come would those items be broad based across all of the separate business units and does any of that give you confidence but maybe your cc business could experience some growth in the second half of the year necip sayiner yes there are two dimensions to the design win traction i would like to elaborate on one is on the cc side these are generally proliferation of our product into the customers we have already won our products are being designed into more models andor some of the newer products with higher content and functionality are being designed into followon generations by and large however the large increase in the number of design wins driven by the broad based business coming from ii side you will see this thing power we see this in our analog business we see a lot of strength in our automotive business both for video decoders and power products so i think above all beyond the large increase in design wins im most pleased with the breath of the design wins we are registering tore svanberg sounds good just one last question on the automotive business so it just continued to increases as a percent of revenue and it sounds like you have to little bit of an inflection point going on right now with dollar content doubling but then obviously once we get to more of the power the battery part of that content when exactly should we expect that to be an inflection point for the company are you already starting to see that now or is that sort of more to come down the road necip sayiner the so called bms revenue is in very early stages at this point this is with our multiple cell balancing products the ultra power business is approximately a quarter of the business now that’s much more diverse in terms of the stock at both and infotainment console and cabin we have still an inflection point in this business to look forward to with  model years this will come in video decoders as well as power and as well as multi cell balancing so we haven’t really seen the full benefit of this inflection due to new product investments yet tore svanberg sounds good very nice quarter thank you richard d crowley thank you tore operator and our next question comes from the line of indiscernible your line is now open unidentified analyst thanks guys really looking to ask a question maybe just finishing upon the visibility question after you said after some digestion on the consumer products here in second quarter and then on the computing also talking about a bit of a pick up after the second quarter i guess what is giving you some comfort that those markets that are going to be a little softer here in q are likely to improve in the back half necip sayiner we have had a very strong ramp at the end of  into q with some notable platforms ramping for product announcement for the end of the quarter it isn’t a unusual for our customers or the supply chain to order quite a bit ahead of that product launch so we have seen a really very meaningful quantities in q exceeding our expectations so we’ll see in the early part of q and special a little bit of digestion of that launch second half for those platform always tented to be meaningfully stronger and based on the forecasts weve seen from our customers this looks to be the case this year there are some additional proliferation of products inside those customers i alluded will also start kicking in in the second half of this year so for us at this stage with the new products coming this is really much more of share gain story than relying on the strength solemnly of the endmarkets unidentified analyst and on the computing side you talked about that ramp of skylake being a bit slower than expected i guess one to what do you attribute that and two does that give you any comfort that this transition where you are picking up some market share and fee increase in dollar content has some legs that might last you well in  necip sayiner yes in sense of units the expectations we had coming into the quarter q was not that far off in terms of actual but the mix was different we’ve seen less skylake than we anticipated there are some very specific platforms that are going to ramp in the second half the power product with some large customers so that should certainly increase the mix of skylake our computing business perhaps the silver lining in the slow adoption of skylake that is what you are alluding to that increase in content growth will certainly have legs into the end of this year into next unidentified analyst but then lastly rick indiscernible a bit lighter here in q and then maybe if it picks up in the second half i guess how do those moving parts impact gross margins through the remainder of the year richard d crowley as we said in the call in january we expected our gross margin improvements for this year to be we closely tied to ii recovery if you recall we went through pretty big inventory depletion and lower demand in ii in the second half of last year in q ii demand improved so the demand and the inventory have come back more into balance so looking forward we guided up  to  basis points most of that is mixed related because i think now the inventory is more in line with demand and manufacture variances is expected to become a smaller factor and a leaving mix stream of the biggest piece so for rest of the year it’s really the same thing as ii demands moves and it should help and improve that should continues to help our gross margin going forward unidentified analyst alright thanks guys good luck operator and our next question comes from the line of john pitzer with credit suisse your line is now open unidentified analyst hi thanks for taking my question this is indiscernible on for john i had a question regarding to your data centre business so last quarter you noted some design wins with hyper scale data center provides i was wondering how this business was tracking if you could provide us a bit more color what you think is a sustainable longterm growth rate and may be at this could rival on the successful growth you see in your auto segment necip sayiner well the design we alluded to are moving forward and that we continue to support our customers through their pre production bills this will create production when intel’s next gens skylake server processors hits currency expected at the very end of this year or early  so this is certainly moving ontrack with all the engagements weve been able to secure as i allotted for in my prepared remarks this is a rather sizeable addressable market for us with  million plus units of servers shipped every year and our content ranging from  to  even higher depending on the configuration or the number of processors on the server board this is a  billion opportunity for us for the product set i think for our first generation offering our share is likely going to be rather modest but for that kind of addressable market i think it would be a measureable improvements in revenues for our infrastructure business indiscernible unidentified analyst great thanks and as my followup i guess you noted some improvements in ii segment i was wondering if you could give any color on how that business on particularly auto performed by geography and how that factors into your longer terms outlook necip sayiner okay well in general in q all regions were up albeit modestly lead by north america when i look at the q north america and asia pac will be up significantly driving that sequential growth the product line segmentation in ii is across the board we’ve touched on automotive seeing a lot of strength it will be another record quarter in q weve seen a little bit of recovery in china out the edeployments and we’re levered to that was some of our power product we will see a meaningful start of ramp or a sizable project in our millero business in q and there is also just the seasonal strength in industrial contributing so it’s pretty broad sequential improvement both in terms of product lines and geography unidentified analyst alright thank you necip sayiner you are welcome operator and our next question comes from the line of craig ellis with b riley your line is now open craig ellis thanks for taking the question and nice job on the first quarter guys necip my first question is just a longer term question on the nature of the consumer business can you just either quantitatively or qualitatively characterize the degree to which your oem and platform penetration is broadening as you look at where you were a year ago where you are now and what the design in sports have for where would be around the year from now necip sayiner sure i’ll give it a thought we have been expecting some of these new revenue for a while now the engagement on some of these platforms date back almost twoyears so i think they have come a long way and secure in not only this generation of targets with some of these customers but also the followon generations for  already with some of other new initiatives on handsets im pleased to see that the proliferation of our product inside some of those customers weve had a few customers where weve had success in china that we reported on last year their success in their marketplace had been mix but some who have been successful in increasing their share and have a global footprints those customers have chosen to put more of our products on their new platform so that is certainly helping so those two combined really a contributed to a record revenue for the new products in q and notwithstanding the digestion we are talking about in q i expect that project to continue craig ellis and do you see other meaningful new customers coming into your mix based on the design wins that you have or as you look at the back half of the yearend and were you would be in the next year with the followon platform engagement is it the current set that you would have necip sayiner so thus far what we feel secure in terms of having most the design winds large majority of that revenue are going to be driven with existing customer just on more platforms and or more content there is addiction of design wins to broaden the customer base but i would have to say majority of the revenue is driven by the larger platform wins craig ellis okay thank you and then the followup question is when an immediate term question the business showed nice cc year onyear growth this year again it’s looks like industrial and infrastructure could be on its way in another couple of quarters and that’s really the question as you look at the business and recognizing we’re in a muddled macro with a cyclical industry can you characterize your confidence that the two primary segments will be back to yearonyear growth this year and what with the risk that are out there be that it wouldn’t get back to yearonyear growth thank you necip sayiner on the cc side the first task will show certainly yearonyear growth and the revenue was on cc was pretty flat throughout the year last year so as with the second half ramps we are alluding to i think its almost a foregone conclusions to suggest that we will see yearonyear growth for cc on ii side we were not that sure about the pace of recovery when we reported days ago days in into the year the pace is a little ahead of our expectations sequentially improvements in q a little ahead of what we would have projected and its breadth and the lean count inventories gives us some confidence that this is a sustainable recovery and if you know we don’t see any big impact on a global basis to the macro there is a good chance that ii can also show yearonyear growth when all set and done craig ellis thank you necip necip sayiner thank you craig operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of ross seymore with deutsche bank your line is now open ross seymore hi guys thanks for letting me ask the questions its similar sort of question to craig just asked if i look back i guess in the last year year and a half somewhere in the low to mid s was where your ii segment had peaked out can you talk a little bit about what the drop has been caused by by the sub segments within that and anything that would preclude you from returning to that kind of mid to  or low to mid s range necip sayiner yes so that’s very similar to the way we look at this if you look at  the ii business was about  million run rate at  was a up bit  million that was the good year for some of our end markets in  it went back to about an  million run rate and now we are somewhere in the  million to  million range so i think the best way to look at this in my opinion is the observation that unlike the cc business where in ii we don’t really have the benefit of new product revenues yet the level of revenue has largely followed the ups and downs of the macro it went up in  in a good year it came down in  it was the more challenging year and now we are seeing some signs of stabilization and recovery with improvement so i think until we start delivering on new product revenue on ii that will remain the case i’m optimistic that with the new product slated to generate revenue for us beginning of  will start disconnecting from in a positive from the ups and downs of macro in ii but thats been the past three years history of ii revenue ross seymore great that’s very helpful i guess switching over rick one for you on the margin side of things if what you are talking about with the kind of seasonality plus company specific growth in cc in the back half of the year does occur is it fair to say that that places some pressure on the gross margin in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year and maybe another way to look at it is how would you think about the yearoveryear gross margin trajectory given what you guys think its going to happen in revenue mix the back half of the year richard d crowley i think the cc anticipated growth will not be as much as of a headwind as you might be thinking some of the quality of these design wins that are ramping that have ramped and will continue to have good margins for us of course computing the sense of that grows with skylake both seasonally and skylake ramp a little bit of headwinds but overall volume of revenue at its solid margins will help so i would anticipate that we should be able to show solid yearoveryear comparisons in second half of the year in gross margins ross seymore great and i guess if i can just sneak in one last one quickly i think there was the indiscernible case can you give us an update on i think it’s a legal finding with the jury today i know you guys have reserved against that to a certain extent but any update on todays news will be helpful necip sayiner sure after the jury verdict over a yearago both the plaintiff and so the defense filed notions with the court so this order today is really the judge’s ruling that sets an notion of process to the court’s final judgment the amounts are in line with our accrued liabilities so pretty much as we anticipated a yearago we fell that claims are without basis and we will appeal a ruling and that process will take months to month after the final judgment comes down which to be relatively shortly ross seymore great thank you operator and our final question comes from the line of betsy van hees with wedbush securities your line is now open betsy van hees good after noon and thanks for taking my question congratulations on the solid quarter i believe we could talk a little bit about seasonality trend so it looks like weve got a couple of headwinds in the computing consumer business in q i might have heard that you talk about what we would expect for a broader seasonal trends in q in both the ii business given that your business has changed so much from what it was a yearago today necip sayiner hi betsy historically the ii business was about flat q to q and there was some level of decline into q i don’t expect this to be very different this year one potential difference could be in our analog business where we see a second half decline over the first half but since we are coming out of a pretty weak period past few quarters and this business is the recovery mode we may not see that set down in or analog business in the second half that could be one pleasant surprise on the cc side typically the third quarter shows a notable improvement in revenues and again while we don’t have great visibility into the demand of our customers or there endcustomers based on what we are seeing from there polls on and forecasts you know we should see a repeat performance this year betsy van hees and then can we potentially given the witness skylake in q and looks like to be in maybe q as well may be sort of a snapback in the q timeframe on top of what we are going to see in the computing business or is that just too hard to tell at this point in time necip sayiner i think it is beyond our visibility that can certainly happen and i think almost optimistic case but so far the pace of adoption has been slower than prior transitions so we would plan on a more modest update but what you are pointing out a certainly possible betsy van hees and then my last question has to deal with inventory level since the computing business did track in line with your temptations but mix with different is that any concerned given that you have had historically problems with inventories and how to do digestion but there is any inventory issues or that you have the right mix not only in the computing business but also in consumer and ii so that the inventory that’s sitting out there is going to be indiscernible for you and we don’t have any repeat of unfortunate last year necip sayiner well the channel inventory was well within historically norms for us while weve seen some uptick in channel inventory it was on the cc side and primarily associated with the ramp that we were alluding to that our distributors was supporting so some of that we know has already sold though and we are being very careful particularly with our distributors in taiwan in managing their inventory in the computing segment and thus far i think we’ve been able to maintain it within acceptable norms betsy van hees thanks so much for taking my questions and once again congratulations on a really great quarter necip sayiner thank you betsy operator thank you and that is all the time we have for question i will now like to turn the call back over to shannon pleasant shannon pleasant thank you for joining us this now concludes today call operator ladies and
