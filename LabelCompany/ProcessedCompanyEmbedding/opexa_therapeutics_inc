response profile to myelin and is designed to reduce the number andor functional activity of specific subsets of myelinreactive tcells mrtc known to attack myelin tcelna is manufactured using immpath™ opexas proprietary method for the production of a patientspecific tcell immunotherapy which encompasses the collection of blood from the ms patient isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells generation of an autologous pool of myelinreactive tcells mrtcs raised against selected peptides from myelin basic protein mbp myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein mog and proteolipid protein plp and the return of these expanded irradiated tcells back to the patient these attenuated tcells are reintroduced into the patient via subcutaneous injection to trigger a therapeutic immune system response fast track regulatory approval tcelna® has been granted fast track status by the us fda in secondary progressive ms spms based on the unmet need of the progressive indication and the potential of tcelna to benefit this patient population opexa has also completed formal end of phase ii meetings with the fda and has received support to move forward with the design of pivotal phase iii clinical trials in relapsing remitting ms rrms opexa is currently conducting a phase iib clinical trial in spms patients and continues to evaluate its plans in the rrms indication tcelna® differentiation tcelna® possesses a unique mechanism of action that combats the demyelination of the nerve fibers in the central nervous system the underlying cause of ms five clinical trials have been completed with tcelna in  patients many with multiple years of treatment opexa believes tcelna may possess a number of advantages compared to other ms therapies currently available or in development including personalization  tcelna® is a personalized autologous immunotherapy that is manufactured for every individual patient tailored to his or her immunity to myelin each patient receives a newly personalized treatment on an annual basis based on their unique epitope profile opexa is unique in that it evaluates  peptides across the three key myelin proteins to identify each patients set of dominant epitopes efficacy  clinical trials conducted to date demonstrate that tcelna® may result in a reduction in the annualized relapse rate arr for patients with ms slowing of disease progression and evidence of an improvement in disability in a number of ms patients which could suggest a neuroprotective benefit safety and tolerability  it is believed that tcelna® treatment selectively targets and regulates the pathogenic tcell population it is not a general immune suppressant and accordingly is not associated with the serious side effects seen by those ms treatments that function by systemically suppressing the immune system in clinical trials conducted to date the safety profile of tcelna has remained superb improved compliance  currently available therapies are administered monthly and in some cases daily the treatment regimen for tcelna® consists of only five subcutaneous injections per year which we believe may provide compliance benefits to patients and physicians clinical development in spms patients with secondary progressive ms spms represent approximately  of the total ms population yet treatment options remain very limited currently there is only one product specifically approved for patients with spms and that product carries a black box warning due to severe cardiotoxicity in an effort to meet this significant unmet medical need opexa is currently conducting a phase iib clinical trial of tcelna® in spms patients   opexa therapeutics inc all rights reserved privacy policy terms of use powered by q inc  opexa therapeutics  about opexa
