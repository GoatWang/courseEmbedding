products completed the spinoff of electronic materials as versum materials and on january   air products completed the sale of performance materials to evonik the q results prior period comparisons and forward guidance we are sharing today are based on air products continuing operations in other words they don’t include the discontinued operations of emd or pmd now im pleased to turn the call over to seifi seifi ghasemi thank you simon and good morning to everyone thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today we do appreciate your interest in air products i am very pleased to report that our team at air products delivered another quarter of strong safety and financial results despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds our team stayed focused on executing our strategic fivepoint plan for the quarter we delivered earnings per share of  up  over last year and in the top half of our guidance range for the quarter and we had excellent safety performance now please turn to slide number three i am incredibly proud of our team for operating whole quarter about  million manhours without a single employee loss time accident considering that we have  employees working around the globe in a variety of operating environments a last time accident rate of zero is outstanding this performance is the best indicator that all of our people are focused disciplined engaged and aware of the highest standards of performance required in air products we did all work hard to strive for this performance in the months and years to come i want to thank every one of our air products employees for their focus attention and discipline now please turn to a slide number four which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company we are determined to continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers now please turn to a slide number five here you can see our overall management philosophy we believe strongly that cash generation is what drives longterm value we believe that what counts in the longterm is the increase in per share value of our stock not the size of our company or growth rates in addition air products has a significant amount of cash on hand and the effective deployment of that cash is one of the most important responsibilities that i have as a ceo of the company now please turn to slide number six our fivepoint plan that we announced  years ago i want to take a moment and expand on the first point our focus on industrial gases our core business in september of  we announced that our strategic goal is to focus on our core industrial gases business in september of  we announced plans to a spinoff material technologies and set september  as the target date to get the job done im very pleased that as a result for an excellent effort by many people in air products and especially the people in our former material technologies business we successfully got the job done in correlations with our plan in two steps step one was to a spinoff tax free to our shareholders our electronics material division as a new company called versum materials which is we successfully have started trading on the new york stock exchange on october   step two was to sell our performance material division to evonik the transaction was announced in may  and we closed and received  billion of cash earlier this month as a result of these actions completing the first step of our strategic plan we now have more than  billion of cash that we can deploy to make acquisitions to profitably grow our core industrial gases business talking about growth i think this an appropriate time to draw your attention to the fact that we have made announcements on january th and again on january th that we have made the preliminary nonbinding indication of interest to acquire yingde gases a hong kong listed company and a major industrial gas company in china we seek to engage in a friendly transaction with the company which we believe would be very beneficial to the employees customers and shareholders of both companies as you may know air products currently has a business in china with about  billion of sales and more than  employees and we are very successful operating in that country now please turn to slide number seven where you can see our three key metrics as you can note our metrics moved as a result of the spin off and sale of pmd but we remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three metrics we remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward now please go to slide number eight which obviously is my favorite slide where you can see our quarterly progress as you can note we have improved our ebitda margin by almost  basis points in the last  years now i would like to turn the call over to mr scott crocco our executive vice president and chief financial officer to discuss our results in detail then i’ll come back after comments from corning and simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be more than pleased to answer your questions scott scott crocco thank you very much seifi now please turn to slide nine for a more detailed review of our q results sales of  billion increased  versus last year as higher volumes and higher energy passthrough more than offset an unfavorable currency impact of  volumes were  higher primarily due to strength in industrial gases asia and continued progress on our jazan project this was somewhat offset by the expected weakness in lg and our other sales equipment businesses which we mentioned last quarter related to our fy guidance in other areas volumes were lower in gases americas and emea corning will provide more color shortly pricing remains largely unchanged across our businesses we delivered operating leverage again this quarter as ebitda of  million improved by  and operating income of  million improved by  ebitda margin of  and operating margin of  improved by  and  basis points respectively as we continue to executive on our fivepoint plan higher energy passthrough reduced operating margins by  basis points operating margin was up  basis points excluding the impact of higher energy passthrough versus prior year net income increased  and adjusted earnings per share grew by  roce of  improved by  basis points versus last year now please turn to slide  you’ve heard seifi and talk about our focus on cash flow our free cash flow was  million this quarter down  million versus last year despite the higher ebitda due to the higher maintenance capex and higher cash taxes based on timing turning to slide  you can see an overview of this quarters performance in terms of earnings per share before i comment on our q operating performance i would like to spend the moment on the nongaap items that totaled  per share or about  million pretax we saw materials technologies business separation cost of  million or  per share for legal and advisory fees as you remember during the second quarter of fiscal  we made the decision to exit our energyfromwaste business and moved it into discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal  we determined it was unlikely that a buyer would assume the remaining assets or contract obligations at the site as a result this quarter we recorded an impairment charge in continuing operations of  million or  per share for air separation unit in our emea segment which was intended to provide oxygen to the energyfromwaste plants additionally in discontinued operations which is where we report results for the energyfromwaste business we recorded a pretax charge of approximately  million primarily associated with a land lease to the energyfromwaste assets we expect to see cost action and pension settlement costs continue through next year further actions will be part of the second  million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest materials technologies further details on all nongaap items can be found in an appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release excluding these items our q continuing operations eps of  increased  per share or  versus last year volumes decreased eps by  per share primarily due to lower activity in our lng business pricing energy and raw materials taken together decreased eps by a penny net cost performance was  per share favorable primarily driven by our productivity actions other income and expense on the consolidated pl is about  million higher than last year compared to the fy quarterly average oie is up about  million this is mainly due to the accounting for transitioned service agreements of tsas where we are billing versum and we will also be billing evonik next quarter through various services which air products continues to provide to both companies the expenses we incurred are primarily in sga what we billed to recover these expenses gets recorded in oie for the quarter currency was  per share unfavorable equity affiliate income increased by  due to better results in italy and asia interest expense was  higher due to lower capitalized interest and our lower tax rate increased earnings by  versus last year our effective tax rate this quarter was  about  basis points lower than recent quarter for three main reasons first our underlying rate improved by about  basis points as a result of separating the mt business second we adopted a new accounting standard for sharebased compensation that result in about  basis points reduction this quarter this benefit will vary quartertoquarter and we expect it will be smaller for the rest of the year and finally this quarter’s rate benefitted from some favorable onetime adjustments including foreign tax law changes worth about  basis points we expect the rate for fiscal year  to be about  turning to slide  id like to make a few comments on our  december balance sheet and subsequent changes as shown on the pro forma column cash on the balance sheet as of  december decreased by approximately  million versus  september to a balance of  million as a result of the utilizing the cash from versum spinoff to repay commercial paper the current or pro forma cash balance after receiving pmd sales proceeds of  billion is approximately  billion we are currently investing the pmd proceeds in shortterm deposits at approximately  over the next few quarters we will pay about  billion in taxes associated with the significant gain on the pmd sale total debt of  billion as of  december is down approximately  billion from  june which is prior to the spin and the sale as we have said our goal is to manage our debt balance to maintain our a a credit rating and we believe that our  december debt balance of  billion meets that requirement as you may have seen in january sp upgraded our business risk profile from strong to excellent due to our portfolio transformation to focus on the core industrial gas business and also our significant ebitda margin improvement so after we pay taxes on the pmd sale and keep about  million to operate the business you can see that we have about  billion to invest in our core industrial gas business now to begin the review of our business segment results i’ll turn the call over to corning corning painter thanks scott our industrial gas business began  with another solid quarter despite the challenging external environment with tepid economic growth and currency headwinds our unwavering focus on productivity drove margins up in emea and the americas while in asia we grew china retail sales by doubledigits i would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control most importantly safety but also serving our customers well and delivering solid business results next i’d like to share another example of the productivity actions we are taking to drive our business improvement we recently completed a program to uniquely tag each of our packaged gas cylinders in nearly every country in which we operate knowing the exact location of each individual cylinder allows us to run our cylinder fill and distribution systems much more efficiently we’ve also found that it enables us to better protect our assets from being refilled by unauthorized thirdparty now please turn to slide  for a review of our gases americas results our continued focus on taking the lead productivity actions enabled us to modestly improve margins despite weak volumes and the headwind from higher energy passthrough from increased natural gases prices sales of  million were up  versus last year as  lower volumes were more than offset by  higher energy passthrough while pricing was flat latin american volumes were down close to  primarily on packaged gases and welding consumables this lowered overall americas’ volumes by  north america volumes also impacted overall americas’ volumes by  as helium and steel weakness offset slightly positive loxlin volumes hyco volumes were modestly positive as the volume contribution from our new plant in canada was mostly offset by customer and plant maintenance outages in the us gulf coast sequential volumes were impacted by hyco outages and lower seasonal loxlin demand operating income of  million was up  and ebitda of  million was up  versus last year as the benefits from our taking the lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes operating margin of  was up  basis points and ebitda margin of  was up  basis points higher energy passthrough reduced the operating margin by about  basis points mean that the underlying operating margin was up  basis points excluding energy passthrough now please turn to slide  in our europe middle east and africa business the team continues to deliver margined expansion despite volume weakness and headwinds from currency versus last year sales of  million were down  on  lower volumes flat pricing a negative  impact from lower energy passthrough and a negative  impact from currency primarily the british pound liquid volumes while packaged gas volumes on a cylinders per work day basis were up slightly but with less work days this year volumes were down overall other than the continued currency impact we dont believe the brexit vote had much impact on our business this quarter operating income of  million and ebitda of  million were both down  but both would have been up slightly on a constant currency basis as our productivity actions more than offset the impact from lower volumes and higher electricity tariff rates we are working to recover the impact of the higher electrical costs in our liquid bulk business operating margin of  was up  basis points and ebitda margin of  was up  basis points driven by productivity sequentially profits were impacted by currency the higher electrical costs and volumes now please turn to slide  gasesasia where you can see the rampup of our new plants and the strength in our merchant business continued to deliver growth sales of  million were up  as volume growth of  was partially offset  on price and  on currency just over half of the volume increase was from new plants primarily an increase primarily an increase in utility cost passthrough our merchant business was up mid singledigits across asia and our china retail loxlin business was again up double digits as weve improved the quality of this business overall merchant pricing was down slightly primarily due to helium as overall asia loxlin pricing and china loxlin pricing were both positive weve seen improvement in the china loxlin plant loadings in fact were essentially soldout for certain products in some regions of china but overall industry overcapacity still remains operating income of  million was up  and ebitda of  million was down  profits were flat as the utility passthrough is by definition at zero margin and we had headwinds from currency and about  million of positive nonrecurring items a yearago operating margin of  was down  basis points and ebitda margin of  was down  basis points versus last year driven mainly by the increase in utility cost passthrough sequentially margins rebounded on lower costs finally earlier this month we announced the next phase of our gas complex in pyeongtaek city south korea we are building a second plant to support our customer’s semiconductor fab business this builds on the major project we announced at the same sight in  ill close with a brief comment on the global gases segment youll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as costs associated with industrial gas business which are not region specific sales were up versus prior year driven by progress on the jazan asu sale of equipment project this quarter which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other asu sales segment profits were up versus prior year as we continue to recognize profit on the jazan project youll recall that we had a catchup profit booking last quarter which is why profits are down sequentially now ill turn the call back over to simon for comment on our corporate segment simon moore thank you corning our corporate segment consists of our lng and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which are not business specific sales and profits were down versus last year on significantly lower lng project activity as we have said the lack of customer decisions on new lng projects is having a significant impact on our business and we still expect at least  headwind in lng for fy versus fy we did see a positive impact from our productivity actions now please turn to slide  and ill turn the call back over to seifi for a discussion of our outlook seifi ghasemi thank you again simon before we take any questions i would like to make a few comments about our outlook please turn to slide number  as we move forward i want to report to our shareholders that air products is in a very strong position in the past  years we have totally reorganized the company in accordance with our fivepoint plan we have implemented meaningful productivity plans resulting in  basis improvement in our margins we have put in place a very robust and effective regionally focused organization with highly qualified managers in place our safety performance has vastly improved an indication that they have the engagement and participation of all of our  employees the productivity programs we have implemented and the new ones under way will continue to drive our earnings per share as they have done in the past  quarters in addition we have focused our portfolio on our core industrial gases business and as a result of the divestment of noncore assets we now have an excellent balance sheet which is by far the best in the industry reflecting our financial strength this morning we announced a quarterly dividend increase of  or  to  per share per quarter for the dividend payable in may we have never had a larger cent per share dividend increase we remain confident in the tremendous growth opportunities to invest in our core business which is industrial gases and our strong financial position allows us to also reward our shareholders directly through dividend increase and profit acquisitions so in short we are confident about the steps of our company but we are a global company with only  of our sales in united states we do not manufacture products in the us that are exported to other parts of the world we also do not manufacture products in the rest of the world that are imported into united states our business is local to where our customers are around the world therefore like any other global company we are not immune to macroeconomic or geopolitical events that can impact our business the new administration in united states has not yet articulated its full economic portfolio and policy in europe six months after the referendum it remains unclear how the uk government will address the exit from the european union is it a soft brexit hard brexit or brexit at all now that the uk parliaments has to vote on the issue in addition it is impossible to predict how other countries will react to the new economic and political developments in the united states and europe all of these events can have significant impact on the level of economic activity and the exchange rates in the areas we operating in as a result we are now more cautious in our outlook our guidance for the full year  eps is  to  per share which at midpoint is an increase of  over last year one of the most bullish predictions than any other industrial gas or chemical companies that i have heard of our guidance for eps in the second quarter of fiscal ’ that is next quarter is  to  per share at this time i do want to once again thank all of our employees at air products for our excellent safety and financial performance in the first quarter our entire team is focused on delivering industry leading performance as we move forward now we will be delighted to answer your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instruction and we’ll take our first question from david begleiter with deutsche bank katherine griffin this is katherine griffin on for david maybe first could we just talk about the drivers of the lower guidance and what you guys are expecting seifi ghasemi drivers of the lower guidance… katherine griffin yes seifi ghasemi well people keep talking about lower guidance i just want to stress our guidance is  to  increase versus last year so i mean the stress on the lower kind of is interesting for me but in terms of why did we take our guidance down there are four key elements number one our base for last year ended up to  lower than what we thought and we closed our books at the end of september if you recall we said it was going to be partial and before we have reported this public within the beginning of january it is  so that is  our lng business is doing worse than we thought because we havent had any orders for our lng that is  more negative our volumes we are being cautious and that will affect us about  we might be wrong on that but that is what we are forecasting right now and then the currency is about  worse so that adds upto about  that is the difference between our guidance today versus it was at the end of october katherine griffin and talking about the chinese industrial gas market in terms of onsite merchant and packaged business could you just talk about how you are  what you are seeing in that competitive landscape seifi ghasemi you mean about business in china in general or about… katherine griffin yes in general seifi ghasemi i would like to turn that over to corning to kind of expand on that corning painter so katherine i am going to focus mainly on onsites and liquid bulk the participation of ourselves and other majors in packaged gases there is a bit small so on the on sight basis its relatively stable and we see the step changes as new plants come on bidding activity is  we’re in discussion with people and that sort of continues the liquid bulk side as i reported in my prepared comments that we continue to see loading of our plants we continue to see an increase of the loading on the retail sales portion of it so allinall i think that’s speaks to despite all or whatever news is out there a fundamental momentum in the chinese economy and certainly in our business seifi ghasemi does that answer your question katherine griffin yes thank you very much operator and we’ll go next to chris parkinson with credit suisse chris parkinson pertaining to any potential ma activity you used very broadly comment on your strategic thinking updates i imagine its probably all of these things but just to focus on onsite businesses geographic diversifications skill and density benefits opportunistic valuations just any color on how you’re thinking about the evolution of your longer term portfolio and any risks that you are or are not willing to take from an asset perspective thank you seifi ghasemi we are in general as we have said many times focused on making acquisitions that will increase our percentage of onsite business that is one of the reasons that we are pursuing the acquisition of yingde which is a company with almost more than  onsite so that in general is the direction that we are going and we do have a lot of opportunities we had talked about asset buybacks most of that asset buybacks are in the onsight business so that is a direction that we are going in terms of geographically we obviously are focused on areas where we think there is going to be growth if you look to chasing growth you have go to places where the population is growing or the standards of living is going up because if you don’t have those things you can talk about growth as much as you want but you are not going to get it so therefore we are focused on china which we believe has great potential we are focused on india we are focused on mexico and we are focused on the gulf coast of united states so there are some opportunities in europe and also in russia so we are looking at around the world but the emphasis is more on the onsite business which is consistent with what we have said before chris parkinson and generally on macro expectations you hit on a few things in the uk but as we’re heading further into ’ it appears that activity in latam is actually picking up a little bit europes mix but on the whole moving in the right direction i suppose just given that some major elections coming up just how are you thinking about general macro and also the willingness of growth in business investments thank you seifi ghasemi in europe chris parkinson in europe and in latin america as well thank you seifi ghasemi well latam  so let me try to take that in america first latin america is weak we at least are seeing some weakness in chile we continue to see weakness in brazil at least for our own business so that is  we are talking about latin america excluding mexico then with respect to europe up to now we have not seen any significant changes our business is moving along in kind of a stable way its nothing to write home about but at the same time it is not following the product so its kind of a steady thing the risk in europe for us is if there is a major shift in currency exchange rates which is not obviously  its just translation but it could have an effect on the eps that we report operator and we’ll go next to jeff zekauskas with j p morgan jeff zekauskas your price raw materials variance was negative in the quarter can you talk about pricing in the different geographic areas and whether you expect this variance to improve in the course of the year seifi ghasemi i think we have a detailed explanation but ill ask corning to address that corning painter probably the most exciting region for us in terms of lets say on the cost side if you are thinking about margin was definitely in europe and in europe typically france is a net exporter of attractively priced nuclear power and had a number of power stations down at one point i think around  and thats really disrupted the power market on the continent so thats been a challenge for us we’re working to recover that in our business and that gets an opportunity for this going forward seifi ghasemi does that answer your question jeff jeff zekauskas can you also talk about industrial gas pricing in the united states and how you think that trend might change in the course of the year corning painter yes so pricing in the us somewhat impacted right now id say one of the biggest movers for us is the overall helium in market and that we continued i think have gone through a period where we have oversupply and the world is working its way through that i think looking forward on pricing id rather not make too many forward statements in that department but i think the helium is one very much driven by supply and demand as that gets absorbed and in the us dlm to be helium facility moves towards greater maturity and ultimate closure i think is going to be an offset to that seifi ghasemi does that answer your questions jeff zekauskas yes thanks very much operator and we’ll go next to robert koort with goldman sachs chris evans can you quantify any impact from stranded costs thats you felt in the quarter seifi ghasemi scott do you want to make some comments on this scott crocco sure let me actually expand the question and take it through some things regarding the transition services and i’ve made some comments in my prepared remarks but i want to make sure i get everybody granted first as i have mentioned we saw an increase in our other income and expense in our pl it was about  favorable versus prior year but when you look at we all know that this moves around there is different asset sales and so forth when you look at the quarter compared to last year average per quarter its up about  million this is principally driven by the tsa that we began to recognize further soon so what we’re going to do here is we’re going to provide services to both versum and evonik evonik will start in this quarter and they’ll go to next  to  months or so the expenses that we incurred and this are principally in the sga line and then we’re going to offset that in other income and expense and so where you saw at the beginning of that here in this quarter on a runrate basis should expect as we have both evonik and versum on we’ll see about  million to  million per year for transition services once we’ve stopped providing those services there’ll be some resources that activities will go away and then we don’t longer need those resources because those activities go away that will play out over the next year to year and a half and then additionally we have some costs in the corporate segment which we have to focus on eliminating so the tsa will cover the costs in the shortterm once those end we’ll take the activities out we’ll take the costs out there will probably be we’ve said in the past about  million total stranded cost that once all the activity goes away we’ll work to offset and eliminate okay hopefully that helps chris evans absolutely and then i guess maybe shifting gears a bit towards your ma strategy specifically with yingde it seems to be consistent with your guided directions that you’ve talked before that go for onsite and then focus on regions like china but if you betted that customer base it seems to be largely focused on steel that might at risk seifi ghasemi well the thing is that obviously we have taken everything into consideration when we looked at that but that company they have done a very good job and diversified although their portfolio is not received they have about   customers and they have a lot of good customers and onsite businesses with the chemical sector so they have a balanced portfolio they are not particularly exposed and we have taken into consideration what the consequences are of the consolidation of the steel industry in china chris evans so similar or legal or contracts that you have in other parts of the world should we expect to that seifi ghasemi well i think considering that we are in the middle of these discussions i think it would be a very inappropriate for me to make any comments about their contracts or anything like that so you allow us to see  do the transactions we can go to all of that with you operator the next question is from duffy fischer with barclays duffy fischer just a question on the capital structure if you were to use the  billion to just go out and buying assets that has ebitda obviously that’s a deleveraging effect even though you were at the level at the end of the year once rating agencies that they were happy with is that the way you would expect it to work or would you take on commensurate debt kind of at the same ratio that air products is today to keep their ratio the same through the acquisitions seifi ghasemi duffy that’s an excellent question i am very happy to answer that because i would like to expand on that our goal is to maintain our a ratings our goal is not to delever air products so if we have the capacity as we buy acquisitions on all of that we obviously have the capacity to take on more debt the key thing is that we want net debt to ebitda to be order of magnitude about  to  to maintain our a rating as you know some of the other people in the industry have net debt to ebitda much higher than that and they still have an a rating so our goal is not to stop our growth because we just want to delever to having no debt now we want to maintain our a rating and whatever that implies in terms of the net debt to ebitda that’s what we’ll do duffy fischer and then obviously the yingde bid has gotten a lot of headlines but is it just as probably that some of other deals or what shake loose this year some of the asset buybacks maybe in the middle east and different places like that seifi ghasemi well obviously that is our intent as you know we have the firing power to do a lot more than just acquisition of yingde we have a lot of more cash and as you said the more ebitda comes in you can do more so we have the capacity to do a lot more and you can rest assured that we are looking at a lot of different things and i hope that some of those materialize soon operator next will be james sheehan with suntrust robinson humphrey james sheehan with respect to the yingde discussions could you talk about how you deal with the currency risk there do you have a view that the currency is not going to decline further or how do you see yourselves mitigating any currency risk in china seifi ghasemi well obviously when we  these industrial gases as you know is a local business it will cost under local and your income is in low cost so there is not too much of a risk the only risk is translation and in addition to that if we do those acquisitions we can always borrow locally and all of that set ourselves from exchange rates that’s the good thing about industrial gases we are very local business and we do business locally james sheehan could you also discuss how you see synergy opportunities at yingde seifi ghasemi as i said since we are in the middle of this thing i think that would be inappropriate for me to address that i think if we ever do the deal we obviously will make a presentation and we will give you all the details about all of our expectations operator and our next question is from vincent andrews with morgan stanley vincent andrews i apologize if this has been asked i had to hop off for a minute but seifi im just wondering  you referenced in the prepared remarks and in the press release the uncertainty over the  president trumps economic policy and so forth but i think its well understood that he has some issues with china and there are all sorts of concerns out there in many different directions so im just curious what gives you the comfort to then go do a large acquisition in china given the uncertainty surrounding economic policy and so forth seifi ghasemi vincent i think what weve said and what we meant to say was that we don’t know we didn’t take a position positive or negative the second thing is that air products has been in business for  years during that time we have had  different presidents we shouldn’t and we don’t run the business on the basis of what political party is in power because we know things change every four radius we are looking at the longterm china is a place that it has the population and the standard of living is going up those are the only things that defect economic growth we see economic growth there for the longterm therefore if we can strengthen our position and be there i think that would be the right thing to do and that is our strategy there might be things in the shortterm that might affect things but we are being paid to look at keeping air products afloat for another  years and taking that view that would be the right place to invest vincent andrews and just as a followup scott i think if i heard you correctly the electricity costs issue that hurt the quarter these do not have a contractual ability to recoup youre going to have to try to recoup them the ordinary way as i seem to recall a couple of years ago there was an electricity issue i think maybe in the us that you were able to recoup quite quickly so is this a different construct seifi ghasemi i think corning will address that corning painter so for the continental europe we have a variety of different contracts that are out there there are some that are formula that takes certain period of time there is others where weve got the ability to surcharge and weve started that process so it depends really customerbycustomer and contractbycontract but there is the ability to go get this scott crocco yes vincent maybe just thats around our merchant business right and so if you’re then looking at our tonnage business those are all under a contract with a defined formula for how they approach and its really not particularly material in the packaged gases space seifi ghasemi there’s a little bit of a timing here vincent as you know very well operator next is steve byrne with bank of america merrill lynch steve byrne technical difficulty production in china would that potentially lead to a tightening of the liquid oxygen and nitrogen markets seifi ghasemi we did not hear the first part of your question i think there was interruption would you be kind enough to repeat to that please steve byrne sure if there is rationalization in china of coalbased chemical production would that potentially lead to a tightening of the liquid oxygen and nitrogen markets seifi ghasemi i would say not very much because a lot of these big plants get supply the coal gasification facilities do not have liquid attached corning painter i would just add i don’t see coal to chemical slowing down especially the element of that using industrial gases coal and electricity right there has been an announcement but that has nothing to do with the industrial gas market clean coal to chemical i think remains an area of emphasis in china seifi ghasemi i just like to expand on that because we obviously operate there and we keep track of these things there was a headline that china has closed on  coalfired power plants thats a totally different subject than gasification for coal for production of chemicals that is actually environmentally times more friendly and the chinese government has not slowed that down and we don’t see any of that at all steve byrne and then just as a followup how would you categorize the role of intellectual property in the industrial gas industry and air products’ overlap with global and regional peers seifi ghasemi well that’s obviously a very broad question we do have intellectual property on certain products that we make in terms of applications and so on but i would say that there isn’that  nobody that claim that that is going to be make a material difference in terms of their performance with somebody else we don’t see that and this is not like intellectual property for software or anything like that no that wouldn’t be too much of a big deal operator our next question is from john roberts with ubs john roberts on the asia gases volumes i think this was at least the eight consecutive quarter of volume growth in high singledigits to low doubledigit rates as you ramp up the new projects how much of your asia sales are now in china and how much longer can you stay in near these high levels of this high base corning painter so almost  billion of our asia sales are in china in terms of the pace there is two elements of what you see reported right now some of that is associated with new plants and largely utility passthrough and that’s going to turn a little bit as our customers progressed in starting up their own facilities in terms of the merchant market well of course that’s subject to economic overall conditions but you can see we have positive momentum there i think most importantly positive around retail sales john roberts and then secondly if the lng outlook remained suppressed could that operation become noncore or because its cryogenic gas equipment in engineering would it still be due to its core in most scenarios seifi ghasemi lng is core business for us for sure because there is no question that lng will come back any kind of the projection that you look at for the longterm lng will come back and that in particular is an area where we do have intellectual property we are going to keep our lng business for the longterm we are going to suffer for a two years but that is the nature of the business lng is core to air products we always said that operator and next will be kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners kevin mccarthy seifi i do wanted to followup on the capital deployment dialogue in response to an earlier question i think you called out mexico is a country of interest as it relates to growth along with china india and the us gulf just wondering if you see any opportunity to increase your stake at infra over the next year or two and then second piece have you had an opportunity or is there any interest on the part of the air products to explore acquisition of any assets that might be castedoff from a potential combination between praxair and linde thank you seifi ghasemi the reason that we mentioned mexico is because there is  mexico is a country which has significant oil and gas resources and we see a lot of opportunities there for us in terms of hydrogen nitrogen and all that kind of stuff related to the oil industry the second thing is obviously the country has a depopulation there is a lot of opportunities there in terms of increasing our shares in core infra we have very good partners there we will fit them obviously we always have the ambition of being having a situation that we can consolidate that acquisition but that is the  it depends on our partners we have a very good relationship with them but if they ever would want us to increase our share we will be more than happy to do that kevin mccarthy any thoughts on praxairlinde castedoff assets seifi ghasemi i know you are asking me that and i don’t want to go there because i don’t want to make any comments about that acquisition things might or might now become available so i just want to stay away from that if they do obviously it would be interesting kevin mccarthy and as a followup if i may on your corporate line recognizing the dearth of lng orders can you perhaps provide an outlook for run rate there for the balance of the fiscal year please seifi ghasemi i think the run rate there is going to be nothing to write home about to be perfectly honest i mean because lng as i said it is a core business for us but the decrease in which that product or that performance has come down was a surprise because we didn’t think that everybody will stop everybody and this is what they have done operator the next question is from nils wallin with clsa brokerage nils wallin i was hoping to drill down a little bit more on your volume guidance and the  headwind would you teaseout perhaps where you are seeing the greater weakness than you had a quarter ago i was a little bit surprised given your onsite exposure was there any sort of expectation that volumes there might also come down seifi ghasemi the reason that we are making a comment on the volume is that the main area we are concerned is in europe because of the brexit that one  i mean it hasn’t had significant affect people say that why are you worried about that it hasn’t had any significant effect on your business of course it hasn’t had any significant business because nothing has been done like its going on i mean uk hasn’t even announced that they are going to a brexit and they havent kind of invoked article  yet what we are concerned about when they actually do that and they do give notice how would the markets react so that is what we are being cautious about nils wallin and then just on yingde i know that theres been a lot of discussion around the growth in china obviously it looks like a cheap asset but is there anything else strategically that you are seeing clearly they were not builders of their own assets is there operational opportunities that you believe are available there seifi ghasemi well obviously since they are not building their own asset that would be a great thing for us because then the next plant and the next plant that they would win will be built by air products so we see significant opportunity there and they are a good company we have a lot of respect for their people they have very good people and we think that the combination of them and the air products will be very good for the employees it will be good for our customers because  and it will give us better position in china so there is a lot of positives there nils wallin thanks very much seifi ghasemi thank you and we are on top of the hour so we will take one more question and then we end the call one more question please operator and the next question is from mike harrison with seaport global securities mike harrison seifi i know the chart on slide eight is your favorite but it could lead some observers to conclude that maybe margins have plateaued here i know that there is some natural gas impact in there that would make the margin better and its obviously been a very challenging environment but how confident are you that you can get the company back to a positive margin trajectory in what you see as a challenging demand environment going forward seifi ghasemi our goal is that in that chart is that we will have a margin which is higher than anybody else i think at  ebitda margin i have never made a statement that there is lot more room to go our goal was to be higher than other people and which we are so we are not forecasting that that margin will significantly improve all of the productivity programs that we have will go on maintaining that margin because our costs are going up but we have never projected that the business has the potential of having much higher margin than that but if anybody else’s margin goes to  i guarantee you that we will be choosing for  but quite frankly i don’t see a lot of upside on that margin mike harrison and then i was also hoping that you could comment on your indura business down in chile you’ve mentioned that it was mostly packaged and hardgoods that was driving the weakness down there are we still looking at a business thats primarily packaged gases or have you been successful in expanding the amount of merchant and onsite business in chile seifi ghasemi our business in indura is challenging because it is mostly packaged gases business and there is not a lot of opportunities to turn that around and have a lot of onsites because there is not a lot of onsite opportunities in chile so we do have an issue there since corning is responsible for that i like him to make some comments on that corning painter yes so maybe just to broader picture on the whole south american situation so keep in mind when we look at our volumes and how they might compare first of all it’s a clean quarter for us we had no substantial new plants coming on in this timeframe and also were much more focused on linde on chile but we also have columbia and our business in brazil is there for us as well we are primarily packaged gases packaged gases has been impacted more maybe just for what its worth our liquid bulk volumes in south america are positive for us in this quarter so its not like we’re without momentum in that space seifi ghasemi okay mike anything else mike harrison thats it thanks very much seifi ghasemi well£ thank you very much then with that i would like to thank everybody for being on the call today again thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule to listen to our presentation we appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter have a very nice day

about company  lehigh valley business cycle photos agents organize exclusive showing of seven luxury lehigh valley homes severe weather alert in philadelphia montgomery bucks northampton lehigh berks and chester countiesjuly  lv business cycle new air products ceo answers questions about company chris shipley special to the morning call air products new ceo seifi ghasemi air products new ceo seifi ghasemi chris shipley special to the morning call sam kennedycontact reporterof the morning call air products ceo says more layoffs are coming in a widely anticipated presentation to analysts and investors this month new air products ceo seifi ghasemi announced a major restructuring of the trexlertown industrial gases company under the plan air products will retain — at least for now — its materials technologies divisionghasemi who lives in new jersey assumed the titles of air products chairman president and chief executive officer july  he previously served as ceo of chemical company rockwood holdings in princeton njlast year he was one of three directors appointed to the air products board to appease activist investor william ackman shortly after ackmans pershing square hedge fund acquired a  percent stake in the company the reconfiguration of the board averted a potentially costly proxy fight though ghasemis subsequent elevation to ceo sealed ackmans victory over the air products veterans who had long dominated the companys upper ranksghasemi spoke to the morning call last week at his office in trexlertown q why did it take air products nearly a year to hire a ceoa because they were looking for the best possible candidate and the board wanted to do an excellent job so that once they had made their selection there is no question that they hurried into it or that they didnt look into all of their options and considering the circumstances that the company was under — so much scrutiny — i think the board did a very good job chris shipley special to the morning call air products headquarters air products headquarters chris shipley special to the morning call q there were rumors that some people were offered the job and didnt take ita thats nonsense being ceo of air products is a great job and everybody knows that were not a small company … i could name about  people who would be very happy to take the job and quite personally i feel very honored to have the opportunity q can you tell us a little bit about your relationship with william ackmana first of all you have to be careful about making assumptions i dont have any relationship with mr ackman … people make a lot of noises but at the end of the day the people who did the transition at this company was the board of directorsq does ackman play a role in the company now or is he just another investora he is just another investor the board runs the company and they have delegated authority to me as chairman and ceo and i run the company … we like all of our shareholders and we respect our shareholders but we dont take orders from our shareholdersq what is your biggest surprise since taking over air productsa well this is not a surprise but the thing i have found very encouraging is the enthusiasm of our people when i say our people i mean the people who do the work — the drivers the operators the accountants the real people the enthusiasm — that they would want to embrace the concept that they want to be no  — that has been the biggest source of inspiration for me and what quite frankly has given me the courage to go ahead and make a very big commitment i feel very good about the people in the company as you know i have met over  of them and i plan to meet all of themq you said youve met with more than  air product employees how did you find the time for thata well you find the time by putting your mind to it that it is necessary … a company is not just a sign on the door it is the individuals who are in it its not just the top  or  people its the real people i wanted to meet the real people and i wanted to understand what their concerns are what their issues are … what we have set as a goal for ourselves is what they want to do they want to regain their position they want to regain their respect they want to be no  again you can talk to the people who have been around here for a while   and air products here in allentown was the best industrial gas company in the world it had the best safety record it had the best financial performance so its the same group of people in the same location why cant we do it againq you said you plan on meeting the rest of the employees is there a diminishing returna no because every one of our employees deserves to meet with the person who is running the company and in the  meetings i have had the last meeting was as good and exciting as the first … people like personal attention and the ability to say well i want to see who this guy is … if im working for a company — its very important that if im going to trust another  years of my life and my career in a company — id like to see whos running itq some people expected you to lop off the materials technologies segment what do you see in the segment that you likea why would we want to do anything with materials technologies before we give them a chance to see what they can do so we are saying look we are going to set you up as an empowered organization were not going to charge you a lot of unnecessary corporate costs see what you can do and what you can deliver if you can get your performance so that it is comparable to gases then you know you are part of the family if its not then its not fair to the gases business … so i think its fair to give them a chanceq you said you are flattening air products management structure does that mean you are laying off middle managersa if necessary yes we shouldnt have too many layers of management so that decisions can be made quickly now if you have managers in between some of them might not be necessary but some of them can be doing other jobs it doesnt necessarily mean that you are gong to fire the peopleq the restructuring will involve layoffs do you have any numbersa we are not starting this process by saying we have a goal of laying so many people off we are starting the process by look what do we want to be we want to be the no  industrial gas company in the world then we are saying what does it take to get there … once you have said those two things then as a consequence of that we will have to restructure and there will be some job losses i dont know how many there will be … lets first of all see where we want to go … then once we have set the target and once we have the organization restructured … the rest of it will followq how long will it take for this process a it is going to take several years to get there … its not something i could wish for and it would happen it will take a lot of people for that to happen so its a continuous process its not something you can say ok its finished now we can stopq how do you feel about layoffsa i hate them id rather be in a situation where the company is growing by leaps and bounds no rational ceo is sitting there wishing to lay his people off what im saying is we need to do what it takes to make this company a very successful company you know i have spoken to our employees and i have been very open with them air products is spending more than it can afford the numbers show were borrowing money to pay dividends no company can survive doing that so this is not as if we are saying we just want to become fatter and richer we need to do some things to make sure we guarantee the future of the company as the years go by and we cant just continue to borrow money to pay for new plants and for paying the dividendq whats the most important lesson you learned leading rockwood that you can apply to air productsa its all about people … the only element of longterm competitive advantage is the degree of commitment and motivation of the people … that is the only way you can win i mean building new buildings and new plants and new technology and new investments that is not going to give you a competitive advantage because other people can copy … its like any sport any kind of competitive game you win because your people are more committed that is the lesson i have learned over and over and over and over again and the obvious lesson that comes from that is that in a company of  people  people cannot change the company its foolish to say that ok im coming here with  new people and were going to fix air products we can only do anything meaningful at air products if all of the people are motivated and excited what do i mean by that i mean to get them to really come to the conclusion themselves this is a decision they need to make themselves to come to the conclusion that when air products wins its good for them and their families because once they come to that conclusion they take ownership and they say air products is me its my company i dont care who is the ceo on the third floor im going to come to work every day and im going to make sure im doing a good job that my coworkers are doing a good job thats how you win thats how great companies are madeq how do you pass the time during your commutea my commute is about  minutes … since im not driving im able to check my emails and make a lot of calls and fortunately we are a global company so at  in the morning when im in the car coming in its in the middle of the day in europe and  oclock in the evening in asia so i can make a lot of calls and do what i do in the office … its like being in the office actually its a very nice thingskennedymcallcom copyright   lehigh valley business cycle energy resources

professional highlights chair president and ceo air products –present chair versum materials –present chair and ceo rockwood holdings – leadership positions gkn – leadership positions boc including president boc americas – executive director national iranian steel industries – best piece of advice “life is about risk if you take the risk you might win or you might lose if you don’t take the risk you always lose” seifi ghasemi chair president and chief executive officer of the industrial gases firm air products  chemicals is  years old but to explain who he is today he tells a story about an experience he had as a yearold schoolboy in northeastern iran hardboiled executives don’t often choke up when they speak to reporters that’s especially true of those who have held major leadership roles in large industrial operations as ghasemi has but the dapper and personable ghasemi wasn’t embarrassed at all to recall a presentation he attended when the shah still ruled iran a country then allied with the us that presentation by us information service visitors to ghasemi’s school described the us as a land of opportunity that offered freedom of religion freedom of expression and a democratic form of government “i just fell in love with the country” ghasemi recalls “after that presentation i was determined i would be going to america one day i read everything i could about the country” ghasemi not only realized his dream of coming to the us but also he excelled in the states driven both by his passion for knowledge and success and by his willingness to take chances along the way he developed a decisive management style that depends in large part on motivating the people around him to succeed to recognize these accomplishments as well as his contributions to the chemical industry the société de chimie industrielle will award ghasemi the international palladium medal at a dinner in his honor in new york city on june  twentyeight ceos including retired dupont ceo ellen kullman and dow chemical’s andrew n liveris have received the biennial award from the industry education group ghasemi first came to the us as a graduate student at stanford university where he received his master’s degree in mechanical engineering along the way he says he also took classes in business and law “because i was interested” but when ghasemi started work on his phd at stanford he met a young woman from upstate new york studying psychology “you know how it is at college” he says “you meet people you fall in love and then we decided to get married so i said i better look for a job and did not finish my phd” ghasemi says he got his ideal first job with bill lear the founder of the business jet manufacturer that carried his name working for lear the young mechanical engineer was given the quixotic task of designing a steampowered automobile engine “i got a patent for him on that engine i was very happy and was paid a lot of money” he says but then ghasemi’s wife a partner whose counsel he says he counts on to this day suggested they go back to iran figuring he might have opportunities in his native country that he wouldn’t immediately have in the us ambitious ghasemi took up his wife’s challenge and soon found himself working to establish a steel industry in iran he eventually wound up with the job of building national iranian steel industries “we engaged  contractors from  countries around the world” ghasemi says “it was a very exciting job probably the biggest job i’ve ever done” all told ghasemi figures the iranian government invested  billion in current dollars to build the company along the way he also got a thorough education in the industrial gases business because of the need for oxygen in the steelmaking process but when islamic revolutionaries overthrew the shah’s government in  ghasemi had to flee for his life “i lost everything” he says although he is reticent on the details of his escape he says his wife and young son were in the us at the time he was reunited with his family in paris in april  they returned to the us where he quickly found a job with airco that firm was soon bought by industrial gases company boc where he rose to be president of boc’s americas unit ghasemi was in line to become ceo of boc but he was passed over and instead joined the british aerospace and auto parts maker gkn although he was familiar with industrial gases and the chemical sector it serves ghasemi might not have become so deeply involved in the two businesses if while still at gkn he hadn’t answered a headhunter’s call to meet henry kravis head of the private equity firm kohlberg kravis roberts  co “they kind of seduced me” ghasemi recalls he joined kkr in  to build its rockwood holdings unit into a large multinational chemical firm under his leadership the firm grew from  million in annual sales to  billion and amassed operations in ceramics lithium chemicals titanium dioxide and pharmaceutical intermediates the firm went public in  at  per share and was sold for  per share or  billion in  the price paid by albemarle “was too difficult to say no to” ghasemi says in  ghasemi joined the board of air products as the firm was being pressed by the investment firm pershing square capital management to make managerial and financial changes in july  he became air products’ ceo at air products ghasemi has culled operations to focus on industrial gases since  the firm sold its specialty chemical business to evonik industries for  billion and spun off its electronic chemicals operations now known as versum materials to shareholders how could he successfully operate rockwood as a collection of businesses but then decide air products needed to be slimmed down to industrial gases alone at rockwood he says “we had a holding company structure each business is totally focused on what it does and there is no interaction between the companies” the problem with conglomerates is “they try to integrate everything” figuring for instance that doing so makes it easier to conduct an audit “so you save  million in audit costs but in the meantime you are creating a big bureaucracy” ghasemi says air products was just such a big company without a focus when he joined ghasemi argues by selling off specialties and spinning off electronics “we created a lot of cash for air products and now the industrial gas business can go and get focused” what ghasemi did with air products is counter to the longterm trend toward industry consolidation a trend that is not necessarily a good thing he says “consolidation only creates bigger companies which are more difficult to run i am not a big fan of size for the sake of size” what’s important ghasemi says is for a firm’s leader to identify its core competency a ceo also needs to explain the company’s goals to employees and must “commit his life to the job” ghasemi says only in the us could he have come by those hardwon insights “no one looked at my background i was not a member of some inner circle i worked hard and i was given a chance because this country and its businesses operate as meritocracies” ghasemi is still inspired by the country he learned about when us information service officers visited his school  years ago “we have a great country and i think we need to be very cautious that we don’t change that” he says   chemical  engineering news issn  copyright  american chemical society     comments mark iven wed may   edt  while employed as a chemist at boc in the s i had the privilege of meeting mr ghasemi when he paid a visit to our plant in wa state after completing a plant tour he requested all employees to gather in the conference room for a talk some of us were apprehensive prior to the talk  what was he going to say would he announce realignments and layoffs or perhaps he would reprimand us for poor performance our fears were unfounded instead of darkness he offered light he expressed appreciation for all our efforts and promised to work together with us to make the company the best in the world he emphasized how important each and every one of us was – that we were as good as the best workers he had ever encountered in the world we walked away from that meeting with a new sense of empowerment we were convinced that we could accomplish just about anything and that he was standing behind us mr ghasemi is an inspiring and truly exceptional leader and i wish him the best» reply leave a comment comments by firsttime contributors will be reviewed prior to appearing on the site this review is done by
