issuesubscribefollow usadvertisementadvertisement  principles of convergence how to work better at the intersection of tech creativity and mediaconvergence is both buzzword and marketing reality razorfish ceo bob lord outlines  ways creative companies can adapt to a converging world and create better brand experiences by bob lord minute readthe word convergence has been picking up steam in the marketing world it may even be the “big data” term of  yet the word means different things to different people at razorfish we use convergence to describe the coming together of three irresistible forces–media technology and creativity–to create experiences that enrich the consumer’s relationship with the brandadvertisementconvergence is a constant process not an end point technology creativity and media are constantly evolving and so is the converged company it is a neverending challenge to adapt a customer experience that in our digital age will always be in flux too often businesses are far behind consumers in embracing technological change a problem that has everything to do with how the organization is set up my new book coauthored with razorfish global cto ray velez converge transforming business at the intersection of marketing and technology describes in detail how enterprises and teams must adapt for an age of disruptionhere are five key principlesput the customer at the centerbeing ready for convergence isn’t about building an innovations lab spending marketing budget on facebook and twitter ads or about hiring a social media “guru” to respond to online complaints it’s about embracing a customercentric mindset and making your entire organization responsive to the customer journey this isn’t as easy as it sounds especially for larger wellestablished companies where scale has mandated the creation of a complicated organizational chart strategies need to be based on data from actual consumer activity not abstract gut feeling that data should dictate not only what experiences you serve consumers but where when and how brand communications must engage the consumer in social platforms and ecosystems and open apis and the retail experience must be made omnichannel giving shoppers the same experience whether they’re instore online or on the phonethink of your brand as a service and experienceyou’re no longer in the business of selling stuff you’re filling consumers’ needs as a marketer you’re creating new products and apps and alwayson ecosystems not just a series of campaigns based around a calendar of product launches nike is the classic example with its ecosystem of fitness apparel gadgets like fuelband and services like nike that immerse the user in the company’s innovation and create an endtoend fitness solution special k one of our clients is still in the cereal game and it sells a ton of it but it’s also in the health fitness and weightloss games it took its special k challenge and turned it into a digital weightloss platformto create and maintain this ecosystem you’ll be investing in marketing operations not just working media and bringing in more designers and developers in the past marketing ops were largely limited to the maintenance of an internal marketing team and hiring and firing agencies that produced the creative work people were accountable for spending the dollars not how effectively they were spent in a converged world it will be about those activities and also about investing in people and systems to ensure that the marketing spending is optimizedadvertisementreject silosmedia technology and creativity are no longer discrete problems let’s take the most fundamental example of this the creation of an ad a few years back a new ad campaign was simply a creative challenge that was solved by coming up with a new flight of tv spots these days a new ad will likely involve some technological and media challenges are you tapping into the api of a hot new social media platform how are you getting your brilliant campaign in front of a demographic that’s no longer watching tvthe traditional silobased organization is illequipped to answer these questions so what you need to achieve is better collaboration between marketing and it to get there your csuite might have senior roles like chief digital officer and chief marketing technologists filled by experts in both functions catalyzing innovation throughout the organization and fostering collaboration or you might try bottomup solutions like internal account management in this structure marketing folks have counterparts in it and vice versaact like a startupthere’s a set of common misconceptions about how established enterprises should learn from startups it’s not about moving into flashy new digs or setting up pingpong tables or having free sushi for lunchlike customercentricity the startup mentality requires much deeper and more meaningful change it requires uprooting many old assumptions and habits especially those around tech infrastructure and doing things the way a newer leaner company mightacting like a startup in this sense means the following–your enterprise deploys–or at least experiments with–cheap fast and flexible tools like cloud computing social media platforms and open apisadvertisement–you employ product managers who are accountable for particular aspects of the consumer experience just like facebook has tasked someone with oversight of the newsfeed as one of our clients describes it product managers have to understand the customer and constantly prioritize and reprioritize what’s best for the customer–you employ agile methodology and rapid prototypingand look no pingpong embrace diversityevery organization needs specialists and experts but in the place of environments where everyone fills one role and thinks about nothing besides that role there needs to be crossfertilization a coming together of various fields disciplines personalities and culturesin practice it’s important to get a wide variety of expertise and perspectives around the table—marketing and technology of course but also hr legal and finance we call this building a big boat and it’s vital to building a convergenceready organizationbut there’s more to it than just getting all the right people around the table you also have to incentivize collaboration getting multiple functions to rally around a shared set of objectives and a shared method of measuring process–that’s a big change and it has to be tracked cleanly and carefully this entails getting your systems to feed a dashboard that tracks a manageable set of metrics then you have to get the team to check in regularly or at least pay attention to the readouts they’re receivingadvertisementadapting your organization for convergence is never over it’s a constant cycle of testing learning building and destroying all the more reason you should start now the winners of this era will be the companies whose main focus is constantly improving on the customer journey if you follow your customer you can’t go wrongbob lord is global ceo of razorfishimage flickr users nic mcphee nasa goddard space flight center dave
