reiner is the managing director of grosvenor investment management us inc gim is responsible for the development and implementation of gim’s business strategy capital markets activities fund and investment development fund raising fund operations and investor relations he also is comanager of grosvenor residential investment partners i lp grip a fund that invests in the us homebuilding industry   what is your outlook for the real estate investment market in the coming year we generally believe that the real estate market across most sectors will continue to improve along with the economy traditional debt is becoming more available as more participants have entered the market we are even starting to see a renewed cmbs market beginning to gain traction there are still risks however in this business there is a huge amount of cmbsrelated mortgage coming due in the next few years and there are real questions as to how that will be dealt with in addition the number of cmbs mortgages being referred to special servicing has increased what types of investments is grosvenor investment management targeting we are focusing on the residential market both rental apartments and “for sale” on the apartment side a shortage of new apartment construction combined with demographic trends have driven down vacancies and driven up rents in many key markets adding to this is the growing number of foreclosures nationwide and the difficulty in qualifying for mortgages which in turn is driving down the national homeownership rate and creating many new renters we like apartment development in particular we want to create class a product that will attract the best renters and core asset buyers thus creating our exit strategy why are you bullish on “for sale” residential we are finding that many of the same forces propelling the demand for rental apartments also are increasing demand for forsale residential product these trends include a stable growing economy new household creation and absorption of existing product in addition there has been a nationwide repricing of virtually all forsale housing assets including existing homes finished lots and residential land at the same time there is a huge shortage of organized capital focused on the industry these trends are creating some very attractive opportunities many leading analysts believe that the forsale market will bottom out nationally in  several earlytorecover markets already have bottomed out and are now stabilized some are even seeing price increases these markets include greater washington dc several texas metros seattle and parts of southern california on the other hand other markets will continue to face major challenges such as many parts of florida arizona and nevada over the past  months gim has made  separate investments across the country in the forsale residential market we believe that this sector is starting to find its legs but continues to be capitalstarved this situation provides our fund with very attractive returns while enabling our local partners to pursue their projects profitably what did you see in  that convinced you to launch a forsale housing fund when the market was crashing actually we began planning the fund grosvenor residential investment partners i lp grip as far back as  with the original investment strategy focused on creating new inventory of entitled land finished lots and new homes inventory to satisfy the nation’s apparently insatiable demand for new homes grip planned to target the fastestgrowing metro areas that were setting records for home deliveries driven by growing populations and investor demand in  we closed on the fund which is cosponsored by gim and key fund management group but then the market began to deteriorate rapidly and the grip acquisitions team was unable to find suitable investments underwriting quickly recognized that home prices were rapidly falling while land owners were still holding to their asking prices this caused margins to be compressed which produced low returns on investments so then what happened it was not a pleasant time to be an investment manager entrusted with  million that was not being deployed during  the grip team conducted a thorough review of the housing market and grip’s strategy in order to determine whether the strategy should be changed or even if the fund should be discontinued we decided to adapt the fund’s strategy to the new market realities we narrowed the fund’s geographic strategy to about a dozen “first to recover” markets including washington dc seattle philadelphia dallas houston portland los angeles and san diego within these markets we targeted infill locations which are better protected from new home competition and have less exposure to foreclosures and distressed sales we shifted from being a creator of new inventory to acquiring existing inventory at big discounts to original cost primarily by acquiring distressed partially completed projects—mostly from financial institutions —and repositioning them to fit current market conditions working with surviving builders and developers that offer strong market expertise in addition the fund shifted from being a mezzanine lender to a senior lender to fill the void of senior debt in the market while preserving projected returns are you seeing more foreign investment which foreign investors are the “next big thing” likely to make substantial investments in us real estate many foreign investors including european pension funds and funds backed by retail investors have targeted the us for investment in  we also expect many of the world’s sovereign funds including those from the middle east and asia to redirect capital to the us i think that foreign investors tend to believe the us is beginning to recover economically and given the turmoil all over the world the us remains a safe haven with a large and deep real estate market what is your perspective on the cmbs market what will change the cmbs market is clearly gaining some momentum estimates for  issuance range from  billion to  billion up significantly from  billion in  but still a far cry from the  peak of  billion the recent wave of activity is being hailed by many as “cmbs ” due to new structural features and more stringent underwriting standards lenders are aiming for lower ltv’s and higher dscr’s in pools with mortgages on fewer properties but as on the core side there is a lot of capital chasing a relatively small number of toptier assets and as market fundamentals improve there will be increased competition to loan notably from insurance companies and the gse’s the question going forward is in a competitive yieldchasing environment how long will the modified underwriting standards of cmbs  last what do you see as the changing needs and desires of institutional investors for example managed accounts niche investments many institutional investors have expressed a desire to invest through separate accounts and clubtype funds as opposed to commingled closedend vehicles with  other limited partner funds they want more discretion and control over investment decisions and strategy and are also demanding more attention and direct communication from their general partners as a result they are putting downward pressure on certain types of fees and requesting more favorable governance features in their funds and accounts another trend we’re seeing is investors wanting to invest with fewer gps—essentially preferring larger relationships with a smaller number of managers that said there does not seem to be as much interest in the “megafund” assetallocation vehicles which have been prominent in recent years many investors are targeting more focused strategies with “bestinclass” managers in specific sectors there are over  funds in the market at the moment so investors and their consultants certainly have a lot to choose from seyfarth shaw llp  ronald gart back
