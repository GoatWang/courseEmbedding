pains but had continued working and was eagerly anticipating a stay with his sister at rugby when he collapsed and died during a visit from his friends elizabeth croft and archibald keightley after a postmortem examination doctors concluded that the artists death had been caused by ossification of the aorta and vessels of the heart lawrences first biographer d e williams suggested that this in itself was not enough to cause death and it was his doctors overzealous bleeding and leeching that killed him lawrence was buried on  january in the crypt of st pauls cathedral amongst the mourners was j m w turner who painted a sketch of the funeral from memory turners painting of lawrences funeral is in the tate gallery a bust of thomas lawrence by edward hodges baily  lawrence was famed for

institution raised £ which was given to his nieces legacyedit elizabeth farrens portrait went to the united states lawrences friends asked the scottish poet thomas campbell to write the artists biography but he passed the task on to de williams whose two rather inaccurate volumes were published in  it would be nearly  years later in  before another biography of lawrence appeared this time by lord ronald gower in  sir walter armstrong who was not a great admirer of lawrence published a monograph the s saw the publication of two further works douglas goldrings regency portrait painter and kenneth garlicks catalogue of lawrences paintings a further edition was published in  sir michael levey curator of the national portrait gallerys – lawrence exhibition produced books on the artist in  and  lawrences entanglements with the siddons family has been the subject of three books by oswald knapp andré maurois and naomi roydesmith and a recent radio play lawrences reputation as an artist fell during the victorian era critic and artist roger fry did something to restore it in the s when he described lawrence as having a consummate mastery over the means of artistic expression with an unerring hand and eye at one time lawrence was more popular in the united states and france than he was in britain and some of his best known portraits including those of elizabeth farren sarah barrett moulton known to her family as pinkie and charles lambton the red boy found their way to the united states during the early th century enthusiasm there for english portraits sir michael levey acknowledges that lawrence is still dismissed by some art historians his explanation is that he was a highly original artist quite unexpected on the english scene selftaught selfabsorbed in perfecting his own personal style and in effect selfdestructing since he left behind no significant followers or creative influence leaving aside sargent his sole successor has been not in painting but in fashionable virtuoso photography the most extensive collections of lawrences work can be found in the royal collections and the national portrait gallery in london the tate britain the national gallery and the dulwich picture gallery house smaller collections of his work in london there are a few examples of his work in the holburne museum of art and the victoria art gallery in bath and in

its only british work in  the national portrait gallery held a retrospective exhibition of lawrences work the director of the national portrait gallery sandy nairne was quoted in the guardian

a solicitor and a clergyman lawrences nephews included andrew bloxam soon after thomas was born his father decided to become an innkeeper and took over the white lion inn and nextdoor american coffee house in broad street bristol but the venture did not prosper and in  lawrence senior removed his family from bristol and took over the tenancy of the black bear inn in devizes a favourite stopping place for the london gentry who were making their annual trip to take the waters at bath it was during the familys sixyear stay at the black bear inn that lawrence senior began to make use of his sons precocious talents for drawing and reciting poetry visitors would be greeted with the words gentlemen heres my son – will you have him recite from the poets or take your portraits among those who listened to a recitation from tom or tommy as he was called was the actor david garrick lawrences formal schooling was limited to two years at the fort a school in bristol when he was aged six to eight and a little tuition in french and latin from a dissenting minister he also became accomplished in dancing fencing boxing and billiards by the age of ten his fame had spread sufficiently for him to receive a mention in daines barringtons miscellanies as without the most distant instruction from anyone capable of copying historical pictures in a masterly style but once again lawrence senior failed as a landlord and in  he was declared bankrupt and the family moved to bath from now on lawrence was to support his parents with the money he earned from his portraits an early pastel portrait

a silvergilt palette and a prize of  guineas by the society of arts in london always in love and always in debtedit lawrences first royal commission queen charlotte sometime before his eighteenth birthday in  lawrence arrived in london taking lodgings in leicester square near to joshua reynolds studio he was introduced to reynolds who advised him to study nature rather than the old masters lawrence set up a studio at  jermyn street and installed his parents in a house in greek street he exhibited several works in the  royal academy exhibition at somerset house and enrolled as a student at the royal academy but didnt stay long abandoning the drawing of classical statues to concentrate on his portraiture in the royal academy exhibition of  lawrence was represented by five portraits in pastels and one in oils a medium he quickly mastered between  and his death in  he would miss only two of the annual exhibitions once  in protest about the way his paintings had been displayed and once in  because he was abroad in  he exhibited  portraits mostly in oil including one of william linley and one of lady cremorne his first attempt at a fulllength portrait the paintings received favourable comments in the press with one critic referring to him as the sir joshua of futurity not far off and aged just twenty lawrence received his first royal commission a summons arriving from windsor palace to paint the portraits of queen charlotte and princess amelia the queen found lawrence presumptuous although he made a good impression on the princesses and ladiesinwaiting and she didnt like the finished portrait which remained in lawrences studio until his death when it was exhibited at the royal academy in  however it received critical acclaim also shown that year was another of lawrences most famous portraits that of the actress elizabeth farren soon to be the countess of derby completely elizabeth farren arch spirited elegant and engaging according to one newspaper

him painterinordinary to his majesty his reputation was established and he moved to a studio in old bond street in  he became a full member of the royal academy although commissions were pouring in lawrence was in financial difficulties his debts would stay with him for the rest of life he narrowly avoided bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by wealthy sitters and friends and died insolvent biographers have never been able to discover the source of his debts he was a prodigiously hard worker once referring in a letter to his portrait painting as millhorse business and didnt appear to live extravagantly lawrence himself said i have never been extravagant nor profligate in the use of money neither gaming horses curricles expensive entertainments nor secret sources of ruin from vulgar licentiousness have swept it from me this has generally been accepted with biographers blaming his financial problems on his generosity towards his family and others his inability to keep accounts in spite of advice from his friend the painter and diarist joseph farington and his magnificent but costly collection of old master drawings lawrence was in love with sarah siddonss daughter sally painting by thomas lawrence eighteenth century another source of unhappiness in lawrences life was his romantic entanglement with two of sarah siddons daughters he fell in love first with sally then transferred his affections on to her sister maria then broke with maria and turned to sally again both the sisters had fragile health maria died in  on her deathbed extracting a promise from her sister never to marry lawrence sally kept her promise and refused to see lawrence again dying in  but lawrence continued on friendly terms with their mother and painted several portraits of her he never married in later years two women would provide him with companionship friends elizabeth croft and isabella wolff who first met lawrence when she sat for her portrait in  isabella was married to the danish consul jens wolff but she separated from him in  and sir michael levey suggests that people may have wondered if lawrence was the father of her son herman lawrences departures from portraiture were very rare in the early s he completed two history pictures homer reciting his poems a small picture of the poet in a pastoral setting and satan summoning his legions a giant canvas to illustrate lines from john miltons paradise lost the boxer john jackson posed for the naked body of satan the face is that of sarah siddons brother john philip kemble portrait of henry dundas lawrences parents died within a few months of each other in  and he gave up his house in picadilly where he had moved from old bond street to set up his studio in the family home in greek street by now to keep up with the demand for replicas of his portraits he was making use of studio assistants most notable of whom would be william etty and george henry harlow the early years of the nineteenth century saw lawrences portrait practice continue to flourish amongst his sitters were major political figures such as henry dundas st viscount melville and william lamb nd viscount melbourne whose wife lady caroline lamb was also painted by lawrence the king commissioned portraits of his daughterinlaw caroline the estranged wife of the prince of wales and his granddaughter charlotte lawrence stayed at the montague house the residence of the princess in blackheath while he was painting the portraits and thus became implicated in the delicate investigation into carolines morals he swore an affidavit that although he had on occasion been alone with the princess the door had never been locked or bolted and he had not the least objection for all the world to have heard or seen what took place expertly defended by spencer perceval he was exonerated pictorial chronicler of the regencyedit the duke of wellington in  by the time the prince of wales was made regent in  lawrence was

house in broad street bristol but the venture did not prosper and in  lawrence senior removed his family from bristol and took over the tenancy of the black bear inn in devizes a favourite stopping place for the london gentry who were making their annual trip to take the waters at bath it was during the familys sixyear stay at the black bear inn that lawrence senior began to make use of his sons precocious talents for drawing and reciting poetry visitors would be greeted with the words gentlemen heres my son – will you have him recite from the poets or take your portraits among those who listened to a recitation from tom or tommy as he was called was the actor david garrick lawrences formal schooling was limited to two years at the fort a school in bristol when he was aged six to eight and a little tuition in french and latin from a dissenting minister he also became accomplished in dancing fencing boxing and billiards by the age of ten his fame had spread sufficiently for him to receive a mention in daines barringtons miscellanies as without the most distant instruction from anyone capable of copying historical pictures in a masterly style but once again lawrence senior failed as a landlord and in  he was declared bankrupt and the family moved to bath from now on lawrence was to support his parents with the money he earned from his portraits an early pastel portrait the family settled at  alfred street in bath and the young lawrence established himself as a portraitist in pastels the oval portraits for which he was soon charging three guineas were about  inches by  inches  by  centimetres and usually portrayed a halflength his sitters included the duchess of devonshire sarah siddons sir henry harpur of calke abbey derbyshire who offered to send lawrence to italy – lawrence senior refused to part with his son warren hastings and sir elijah impey talented charming and attractive and surprisingly modest lawrence was popular with bath residents and visitors artists william hoare and mary hartley gave him encouragement wealthy people allowed him to study their collections of paintings and lawrences drawing of a copy of raphaels transfiguration was awarded a silvergilt palette and a prize of  guineas by the society of arts in london always in love and always in debtedit lawrences first royal commission queen charlotte sometime before his eighteenth birthday in  lawrence arrived in london taking lodgings in leicester square near to joshua reynolds studio he was introduced to reynolds who advised him to study nature rather than the old masters lawrence set up a studio at  jermyn street and installed his parents in a house in greek street he exhibited several works in the  royal academy exhibition at somerset house and enrolled as a student at the royal academy but didnt stay long abandoning the drawing of classical statues to concentrate on his portraiture in the royal academy exhibition of  lawrence was represented by five portraits in pastels and one in oils a medium he quickly mastered between  and his death in  he would miss only two of the annual exhibitions once  in protest about the way his paintings had been displayed and once in  because he was abroad in  he exhibited  portraits mostly in oil including one of william linley and one of lady cremorne his first attempt at a fulllength portrait the paintings received favourable comments in the press with one critic referring to him as the sir joshua of futurity not far off and aged just twenty lawrence received his first royal commission a summons arriving from windsor palace to paint the portraits of queen charlotte and princess amelia the queen found lawrence presumptuous although he made a good impression on the princesses and ladiesinwaiting and she didnt like the finished portrait which remained in lawrences studio until his death when it was exhibited at the royal academy in  however it received critical acclaim also shown that year was another of lawrences most famous portraits that of the actress elizabeth farren soon to be the countess of derby completely elizabeth farren arch spirited elegant and engaging according to one newspaper lawrence exhibited in  royal academy annual exhibitions in  lawrence was elected an associate of the royal academy and the following year on the death of sir joshua reynolds king george iii appointed him painterinordinary to his majesty his reputation was established and he moved to a studio in old bond street in  he became a full member of the royal academy although commissions were pouring in lawrence was in financial difficulties his debts would stay with him for the rest of life he narrowly avoided bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by wealthy sitters and friends and died insolvent biographers have never been able to discover the source of his debts he was a prodigiously hard worker once referring in a letter to his portrait painting as millhorse business and didnt appear to live extravagantly lawrence himself said i have never been extravagant nor profligate in the use of money neither gaming horses curricles expensive entertainments nor secret sources of ruin from vulgar licentiousness have swept it from me this has generally been accepted with biographers blaming his financial problems on his generosity towards his family and others his inability to keep accounts in spite of advice from his friend the painter and diarist joseph farington and his magnificent but costly collection of old master drawings lawrence was in love with sarah siddonss daughter sally painting by thomas lawrence eighteenth century another source of unhappiness in lawrences life was his romantic entanglement with two of sarah siddons daughters he fell in love first with sally then transferred his affections on to her sister maria then broke with maria and turned to sally again both the sisters had fragile health maria died in  on her deathbed extracting a promise from her sister never to marry lawrence sally kept her promise and refused to see lawrence again dying in  but lawrence continued on friendly terms with their mother and painted several portraits of her he never married in later years two women would provide him with companionship friends elizabeth croft and isabella wolff who first met lawrence when she sat for her portrait in  isabella was married to the danish consul jens wolff but she separated from him in  and sir michael levey suggests that people may have wondered if lawrence was the father of her son herman lawrences departures from portraiture were very rare in the early s he completed two history pictures homer reciting his poems a small picture of the poet in a pastoral setting and satan summoning his legions a giant canvas to illustrate lines from john miltons paradise lost the boxer john jackson posed for the naked body of satan the face is that of sarah siddons brother john philip kemble portrait of henry dundas lawrences parents died within a few months of each other in  and he gave up his house in picadilly where he had moved from old bond street to set up his studio in the family home in greek street by now to keep up with the demand for replicas of his portraits he was making use of studio assistants most notable of whom would be william etty and george henry harlow the early years of the nineteenth century saw lawrences portrait practice continue to flourish amongst his sitters were major political figures such as henry dundas st viscount melville and william lamb nd viscount melbourne whose wife lady caroline lamb was also painted by lawrence the king commissioned portraits of his daughterinlaw caroline the estranged wife of the prince of wales and his granddaughter charlotte lawrence stayed at the montague house the residence of the princess in blackheath while he was painting the portraits and thus became implicated in the delicate investigation into carolines morals he swore an affidavit that although he had on occasion been alone with the princess the door had never been locked or bolted and he had not the least objection for all the world to have heard or seen what took place expertly defended by spencer perceval he was exonerated pictorial chronicler of the regencyedit the duke of wellington in  by the time the prince of wales was made regent in  lawrence was acknowledged as the foremost portrait painter in the country through one of his sitters lord charles stewart he met the prince regent who was to become his most important patron as well as portraits of himself the prince commissioned portraits of allied leaders the duke of wellington fieldmarshal von blücher and count platov sat for lawrence at his new house at  russell square the house was demolished in the early th century to make way for the imperial hotel the private sittingroom of sir thomas lawrence shows lawrence at  russell square surrounded by casts of classical sculpture the prince also had plans for lawrence to travel abroad and paint foreign royalty and leaders and as a preliminary he was given a knighthood on  april  napoleons return from elba put these plans on hold although lawrence did make a visit to paris where his friend lord charles stewart was ambassador and saw the art that napoleon had looted from italy including raphaels transfiguration the painting he had reproduced for his silvergilt palette as a boy lawrence painted pope pius vii in rome in  in  the prince commissioned lawrence to paint a portrait of his daughter princess charlotte who was pregnant with her first child charlotte died in childbirth lawrence completed the portrait and presented it to her husband prince leopold at claremont on his birthday as agreed the princesss obstetrician sir richard croft who later shot himself was the halfbrother of lawrences friend elizabeth croft and for her lawrence drew a sketch of croft in his coffin eventually in september  lawrence was able to make his postponed trip to the continent to paint the allied leaders first at aachen and then at the conference of vienna for what would become the waterloo chamber series housed in windsor castle his sitters included tsar alexander emperor francis i of austria the king of prussia fieldmarshal prince schwarzenberg archduke charles of austria and henriette his wife and a young napoleon ii as well as various french and prussian ministers in may  still under orders from the prince regent he left vienna for rome to paint pope pius vii and cardinal consalvi president of the royal academyedit anne viscountess pollington later countess of mexborough d  with her son john charles later th earl of mexborough london moretti fine art collection lawrence arrived back in london  march  to find that the president of the royal academy benjamin west had died that very evening lawrence was voted the new president a position he would hold until his death  years later george iii had died in january lawrence was granted a place in the procession for the coronation of george iv on  february  he was elected as a fellow of the royal society for his eminence in art the royal commissions continued during the s including one for a portrait of the kings sister sophia and one of sir walter scott along with jane austen one of lawrences favourite authors as well as one to paint king charles x of france for the waterloo series for which lawrence made a trip to paris taking herman wolff with him lawrence acquired another important patron in robert peel who commissioned the painter to do portraits of his family as well a portrait of george canning two of lawrences most famous portraits of children were painted during the s that of emily and laura calmady and that of master charles william lambton painted for his father lord durham for  guineas and known as the red boy the latter portrait attracted much praise when it was exhibited in paris in  one of the artists last commissions was of future primeminister the earl of aberdeen fanny kemble a niece of sarah siddons was one of his last sitters for a drawing lawrence died suddenly on  january  just months after his friend isabella wolff a few days previously he had experienced chest pains but had continued working and was eagerly anticipating a stay with his sister at rugby when he collapsed and died during a visit from his friends elizabeth croft and archibald keightley after a postmortem examination doctors concluded that the artists death had been caused by ossification of the aorta and vessels of the heart lawrences first biographer d e williams suggested that this in itself was not enough to cause death and it was his doctors overzealous bleeding and leeching that killed him lawrence was buried on  january in the crypt of st pauls cathedral amongst the mourners was j m w turner who painted a sketch of the funeral from memory turners painting of lawrences funeral is in the tate gallery a bust of thomas lawrence by edward hodges baily  lawrence was famed for the length of time he took to finish some of his paintings isabella wolff waited twelve years for her portrait to be completed and at his death his studio contained a large number of unfinished works some were completed by his assistants and other artists some were sold as they were in his will lawrence left instructions to offer at a price much below their worth his collection of old master drawings to first george iv then the trustees of the british museum then robert peel and the earl of dudley none of them accepted the offer and the collection was split up and auctioned many of the drawings later found their way into the british museum and the ashmolean museum after lawrences creditors had been paid there was no money left although a memorial exhibition at the british institution raised £ which was given to his nieces legacyedit elizabeth farrens portrait went to the united states lawrences friends asked the scottish poet thomas campbell to write the artists biography but he passed the task on to de williams whose two rather inaccurate volumes were published in  it would be nearly  years later in  before another biography of lawrence appeared this time by lord ronald gower in  sir walter armstrong who was not a great admirer of lawrence published a monograph the s saw the publication of two further works douglas goldrings regency portrait painter and kenneth garlicks catalogue of lawrences paintings a further edition was published in  sir michael levey curator of the national portrait gallerys – lawrence exhibition produced books on the artist in  and  lawrences entanglements with the siddons family has been the subject of three books by oswald knapp andré maurois and naomi roydesmith and a recent radio play lawrences reputation as an artist fell during the victorian era critic and artist roger fry did something to restore it in the s when he described lawrence as having a consummate mastery over the means of artistic expression with an unerring hand and eye at one time lawrence was more popular in the united states and france than he was in britain and some of his best known portraits including those of elizabeth farren sarah barrett moulton known to her family as pinkie and charles lambton the red boy found their way to the united states during the early th century enthusiasm there for english portraits sir michael levey acknowledges that lawrence is still dismissed by some art historians his explanation is that he was a highly original artist quite unexpected on the english scene selftaught selfabsorbed in perfecting his own personal style and in effect selfdestructing since he left behind no significant followers or creative influence leaving aside sargent his sole successor has been not in painting but in fashionable virtuoso photography the most extensive collections of lawrences work can be found in the royal collections and the national portrait gallery in london the tate britain the national gallery and the dulwich picture gallery house smaller collections of his work in london there are a few examples of his work in the holburne museum of art and the victoria art gallery in bath and in bristol city museum and art gallery in the united states the huntington library houses pinkie and lawrences portraits of elizabeth farren lady harriet maria conyngham and the calmady children are in the metropolitan museum of art in europe the musée du louvre has a few examples of lawrences work and the vatican pinacoteca has a swagger portrait of george iv presented by the king himself as almost its only british work in  the national portrait gallery held a retrospective exhibition of lawrences work the director of the national portrait gallery sandy nairne was quoted in the guardian describing lawrence as a huge figure but a huge figure who we believe deserves a great deal more attention he is one of the great painters of
