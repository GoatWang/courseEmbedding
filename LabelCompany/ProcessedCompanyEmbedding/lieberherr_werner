all bizspace properties as demand for aviation parts and supplies increases aircraft cabin interior maker be aerospace is expecting significant growth ahead while be is headquartered in wellington fla werner lieberherr be aerospace’s president and chief operating officer manages operations from winston salem where the business employs nearly  fulltime workers and houses its aircraft seating product division and commercial aircraft segment be aerospace also houses numerous core functions in winstonsalem ranging from strategy and global operations to human resources supply chain and marketing you became president and coo in  how has the company changed since i would say it changed in a positive way we have more revenues and we were able to hire more people last year was a record year for be aerospace with  percent growth in the commercial aircraft segment to what do you attribute that growth out of the  percent i would say probably at least half of it came from the seating business what do you think is driving that it’s a good market i also believe that we have a very competitive product we invest a lot in innovation product development we invest a lot in terms of having the right people in the right place creating a motivating environment and i think that drives the growth to a large degree one of be aerospace’s products is the lightweight pinnacle seat how have customers reacted to that lightweight seat i think they reacted very well the pinnacle seat was actually the most successful seat introduction of any economy seat including the competition so we are very proud of that we were able to win orders for  aircraft which is a lot and about  million in revenue so it’s massive it’s a very successful product be aerospace recently won an  million deal from boeing can you talk about the significance of that deal it’s one of if not the most important wins for our company it’s actually a lavatory for the  it’s a very innovative solution we actually made more space i would say depending on the airline between two and six seats more on the  aircraft which is a very big deal did you play a role in that deal yes it’s always very hard to become a tier  supplier to boeing to become a tier  supplier on a highrate program like the  yes my team spent a lot of time on it i spent a lot of time on it has the consolidation of the airline industry affected business i think in a positive way because we were actually very wellestablished with the market leaders when i say market leaders in the airlines it’s really continental united in europe air france and klm came together for us it means more revenue because if you have a competitive product they want to roll it out across the fleet do you project that the seating business will increase seating will definitely grow further i would say the biggest challenge we have is to find engineers it’s a big problem we could grow even faster if we would actually be able to hire more engineers i find the triad area is a very compelling place to do business but when it comes to that kind of resource it’s scary what has be aerospace done to bring that talent in we look for people from outside the area we run job fairs in different places we approach universities for young engineers does be aerospace envision expanding its winstonsalem facility what we do is we keep on hiring people yes we look for more space because space is very constrained at this point from an office environment where are you originally from i grew up in switzerland and then lived in various places europe middle east later i moved to asia what’s the biggest difference you’ve noticed culturally having lived in the us and other parts of the world when i look between europe asia and the us i think for each there is something to be said in europe it’s the history the culture the diversity asia is extremely entrepreneurial so i find that really compelling — the way they think about business the drive the commitment in the us i think it’s an easy way to live we have two young kids and are very happy here it’s a great place to raise children i find to do business in the us it’s a good environment people i find are very committed you can see this with our company what i am the most proud of is our employees what is your management style i’m peoplecentric and i like to work in a team environment but i would say i am demanding i like to achieve results but i like to do it together with people switzerland is very similar to the leadership style in the american environment it’s very collaborative i have an open door policy i walk around in the office here and in other offices whereever i visit i think it’s really important that you have the personal touch with many people in the organization because at the end of the day these people drive the results what are you passionate about outside of work i would say my two little girls they are  and  now i travel a lot so i spend a lot of time with them title
