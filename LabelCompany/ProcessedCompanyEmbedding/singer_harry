computers to vehicles to reachin refrigeration and ranges the purchases can be written off immediately on a business’ taxes instead of being depreciated over a number of years while most equipment that small businesses lease finance or purchase will qualify for the section  deduction there are some exceptions such as air conditioning or heating equipment and property used outside the united states information on qualifying capital items can be found herethe deduction is essentially limited to small and midsize companies it begins phasing out when a company spends more than  million a
