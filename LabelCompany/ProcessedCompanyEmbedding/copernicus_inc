therapeutics inc nucleic acid nanoparticles for treating human diseases business copernicus business strategy overview copernicus therapeutics inc is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with its main focus upon developing its unique nucleic acid delivery and expression technologies for treating the root cause of cystic fibrosis  exploiting its proprietary and complementary technologies copernicus has developed a nonviral nucleic acid delivery platform that permits the rapid design of nucleic acid drugs  this custom design of nucleic acid delivery vectors has significant efficacy safety and time to market advantages over vectors used by others  as an example of the power of copernicus’ technologies its lead product for treating cystic fibrosis has shown encouraging results in a clinical trial that we believe demonstrate superior safety and efficacy parameters when compared to others the business strategy of copernicus is to build value by focusing on its core competencies thus positioning copernicus to become the preferred partner of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies holding rights to genomic information and therapeutic genes that would benefit from access to the nanoparticle delivery technology  the outcome of this strategy is to provide copernicus with revenue streams obtained from research development and manufacturing agreements from corporate partners  since all the first generation products use the same raw materials plasmid dna and pegylated lysine peptides the manufacturing process is the same  copernicus intends to leverage our core competency to provide additional sources of revenue  copernicus can provide assistance from discovery to production  each product developed utilizes the same modular copernicus platform technologies  this modular nature reduces the risk of development and permits copernicus to perform the needed tasks faster smarter and for less cost the ability to use nonviral vectors to transfer dna drugs to nondividing cells is unique to copernicus  copernicus has outstanding opportunities available to it and its future partners in the following fields •    cystic fibrosis – delivery of dna drugs to the lung by aerosols  an initial clinical trial in subjects with cf was encouraging and copernicus is seeking funding to move this lead program forward•    eye diseases – delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics is enabled using copernicus’ nonviral delivery technology  proof of concept in animal models of eye disease have been published•    brain diseases – copernicus has published proof of concept studies demonstrating that delivery of a therapeutic gene in an animal model of parkinson’s disease has benefit  delivery can be after a needle injection into the appropriate part of the brain or as simple as nasal installation of dna nanoparticles•    lung diseases – the cf program has demonstrated our ability for delivery to lung cells  delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to treat andor prevent other serious lung diseases is possible with our technology homeoverviewtechnologybusinessprogramsabout usmeet our peoplepress releasespublicationscontact us copernicus inc  wilton ct  company
