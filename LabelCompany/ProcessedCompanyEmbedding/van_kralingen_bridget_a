jeopardy champions is helping solve new and different problems  through “cognitive computing”oncologists for example are asking watson for second opinions on treatment recommendations retailers are interpreting social data call centers are using it to predict customer questions and give faster answers and a railway executive is expecting watson to soon detect faulty sections of trackwatson digests massives amount of information especially natural language and “learns” by reprogramming itself as it receives more information in may ibm introduced the first product it expects to be rolled out in volume the watson engagement advisor the supermarket chain kroger is testing it in call centers right now watson is consuming all of kroger’s customer information imagine that a customer calls in with a question about where he can use the points from his kroger fuel rewards program a call center employee would ordinarily have to skim the program rules find instructions about where points can be used and review the customer’s account that’s hard to do in a few seconds that’s why half of the  billion annual calls to call centers according to ibm either are unresolved or require supervisors to get on the line soon a kroger call center employee will be able to hit an ask watson button to provide faster more accurate and more helpful support says kroger chief information officer chris hjelm “this can make everybody an expert”ceo ginni rometty believes the enterprise of the future will be defined by three characteristicsfirst data will drive every decision take for example managing attrition an area long considered as much art as science how do you keep talented people from leaving in  ibm launched a pilot program in one division using watson’s technology to answer that question the program examined the obvious factors including compensation benefits worklife balance and opportunities for career development but it also made connections to data that humans might not consider for example the software noticed that a woman working as an industry consultant was making social media connections with people who work on cloud computing to keep her engaged ibm assigned her a new mentor who was senior in its cloud business “not only did the attrition reduce by ” says rometty of the pilot but “what we spent in the right places went down by  million” that number factors in what it would cost to recruit replace and train people over several years ibm now uses this process throughout the companysecond rometty predicts that companies will use their wealth of information to create new types of goods and services to help that along she says ibm will open pieces of watson’s software code to outside developers by the end of the year so they can fuse their own good ideas with itthird according to the ceo the new enterprise will make a giant leap in its ability to nurture oneonone relationships directly with consumers whereas today a business can slice and dice data to the point that it can target say a yearold single female college graduate in st paul the volume of data and the ability to manage it will escalate to the point that a company can target say cindy davis of  maple st in st paul ibm is also collaborating with its clients and opening new possibilities for consumers bridget van kralingen head of ibm’s business consulting division

 bridget van kralingen runs ibm’s ibm personplus consulting business in an expanded version of an interview in the latest issue of fortune van kralingen explains ibm’s marriage of research and consulting its new digital agency approach to africa and plan for growthon research  consultingwhat happened in the past is that youd really cowork with research on oneoff projects but what weve identified is that some of our clients are now looking to experiment with how to engage and how to use data for engagement with their customers how to make sure that they are actually personalizing and segmenting a lot of the mathematical research concepts that we use if we actually blend them and fuse them with consulting were able to take them and really scale them across many many clientsso we started this concept called the customer experience lab which we launched last year and within three months of starting it had  projects going because our clients really wanted to start to experiment and it was all sorts of interesting things like building psychographic profiles and understanding different ways of suggesting nextstep actionsits almost an era of runaway innovation if youre focused on innovating with speed this is a very interesting capability for you to use as an organizationon running a digital agencyour digital agency works with sales with marketing helps build campaigns and helps build beautiful designs so if youre a golfer and you ever get onto the masters app or you love tennis and you go on the us open app and those experiences you have on there thats the design capability that we have which is interaction and the design of the application to pull you in and engage you in the data and suggest a nextstep action for youso when i think about the way i would describe our interactive experience its being able to design experiences that are engaging and really pull users in and make them want to engage and involve a reciprocal interaction between our client organization and these customers and make sure that our clients can actually deliver that experience and do it in a way the designs great it links into the backing system so they can use the data and that its safe and secureon africawe really have strong longterm growth in africa so we announced earlier this year a  million investment to bring watson to africa and we will basically put the very first instance of watson in our kenya lab we call it project lucy and we will start bringing cognitive systems to africa so thats a big thing we actually already have  research labs in the world we announced one in africa early this year as well our kenya lab so thats the only one in africa and obviously  is a very small number so for us thats a very important strategic investment we are focused in that research lab on what we call the grand challenges of the african continent were trying to really mine data to help find solutions to energy water transportation agriculture and health care issues in africa thats a very important investment for uswe also made all our software available to african users free of charge they can experiment and build on it and play with it and the reason we did that is partly to help build skills and partly to get people in africa aware and comfortable with ibm software so that donation obviously has a longterm impact in building skills on our software but its a very very key oneand then over the last couple of years weve set up offices in angola mauritius tanzania senegal ghana nigeria and kenya and then we added as well as those another  countries as part of a network to provide one of the continents leading telco leaders with it services that it gives at the present in  other countries around thoseand then we really focus on i think some very interesting areas in africa so we did—actually i ended up chairing ibms work on microfinance we did some work with the grameen foundation a lot of pro bono work and thats led to us doing a lot of work around banking and mobile payments around africa cloud solutions we work with a number of the mobile providers on mobile payments and help expand mobilebased serviceson growthweve worked hard on our portfolio and really if you think about the portfolio as really reflecting a set of marketplace shifts and having three copillars data will be the source of competitive advantage hence the investment in analytics cloud will be the basis of new business models it will be the way businesses are run and engagement at this more personalized real time mobile individualized level will be the way in which companies get and gain both customers and employees and will become everyones expectationso essentially if you really boil it down those are reasons that we think and areas and they are what drives our investment so in some ways we probably cut and trimmed a lot of things that dont pertain to those things and each of these initiatives  our analytics capability our cloud capability and our engagement capability  are the agents of the investments and those are the ones that we believe will drive both and weve prioritized themcustomer servicesite mapprivacy

ibm marketplace contributors archive blockchain’s role in improving global food safety october    written by bridget van kralingen share this post the focus on safety throughout the global food supply chain is at an alltime high for all the wrong reasons the numbers of people sickened by contaminated food products continues to escalate and recalls are issued with increasing frequency like virtually every other complex issue in a world dominated by data and how it’s used the complex “system of systems” that is our global network of food production inspection and distribution is primed for improvement via more open transparent and fluid handling of information at every point in the journey from field to fork food authentication and supply chain tracking is a critical step in quickly finding and helping address sources of contamination around the world blockchain presents an innovative new way to work toward achieving these goals credit ibm it’s high time according to the world health organization an estimated  million – almost  in  people in the world – fall ill after eating contaminated food every year and  of them die — resulting in the subtraction of  million healthy life years from global societies and economies the cost to individual lives is not the only substantial expense of foodborne illnesses in a recent study the estimated total national cost in the us has spiked to  billion a year an astounding increase of almost  percent in just the last four years one looming issue in food safety is its provenance which has minimal existing technology used to track food from the farm to plates to supply the world with millions of pounds of food much of it must pass through many people organizations and governments that cultivate influence or audit how it arrives to consumers collaboration and trust between governments producers and suppliers is needed to reestablish consumers’ faith in the global food supply chain in a recent survey  percent of consumers in the us said they are not provided with enough information about what is in their food and its origins more than  percent of consumers reported it is somewhat or very important to know where their food is coming from ibm is leveraging blockchain to make the global food chain more transparent authentic and trustworthy blockchain is like a computer’s operating system regulating interactions and because it creates an immutable digital record of these transactions it is ideal for tracing the safety and authenticity of goods as they move from food suppliers to store shelves and consumers a recent ibm institute for business value ibv study on blockchain in the supply chain found by digitally tracking the provenance and movement of food throughout the entire supply chain purveyors have instant quality assurance that the products they receive and serve customers are safe with blockchain this information flow can be widely shared to enhance decisions at all levels of the supply chain for example “ready to eat” foods – such as frozen lasagna – top the list for recalled food products by a wide margin because they involve a large supply chain with multiple parties readytoeat food once processed typically requires a third party such as a logistics provider to transport the food to distribution warehouses sometimes another supply chain partner provides this service and then often another intermediary provider will deliver the food from the warehouse to the store that’s not only expensive but maintaining the quality standards set by regulators by the usda to keep perishable products safe is also a challenge particularly when the product contains frozen meat vegetables or milk products putting this transaction record on the blockchain can create significant savings in time cost and transparency blockchain can transparently track the provenance of goods as they are passed from one organization to the next building awareness and trust scientists from ibm research and researchers from tsinghua university are working alongside top talent in transaction security and authentication technology from tsinghua university and with walmart’s expertise in supply chain logistics and food safety to create a new model for food traceability supply chain transparency and auditability using ibm blockchain based on the open source linux foundation hyperledger project fabric the collaboration of walmart ibm and tsinghua university takes advantage of the distinctive strengths of each member of the team scientists from ibm research – china are among the leading edge technologists at ibm now in the forefront of the rapid evolution of blockchain this can help retailers like walmart better supervise and manage the shelf life of products and reduce the risk of noncompliance in individual stores ensuring that consumers are getting authenticated safe products which is exactly the answer required bridget van kralingen senior vice president global
