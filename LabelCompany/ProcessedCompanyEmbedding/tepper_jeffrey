writing lg electronics newsletter articles while at publicis i wrote a bunch of articles for the monthly lg electronics newsletters these are articles sent out to existing lg customers as part of a crm campaign it was great i got to write about scary movies which i love and do a great deal of research on a few other topics i am a research nerd and i love learning about new things so that i could eventually write about them and pretend im some sort of expert notice the beautiful art direction by my occasional partner andrea sabbatini please check him out at wwwandreasabbatinius top  horror film themes for the october lg newsletter i had originally written about my top  favorite horror movies that flew a bit under the radar unfortunately mentioning specific movies wouldnt fly past legal so i wrote about my top  favorite horror movie clichés the original scary movie article is down towards the bottom if you want to check it out my opinions on scary movies are great and youll probably agree or not youre welcome to debate me please debate me im so lonely fun facts about oysters i love oysters but i knew nothing about them before this i did a whole bunch of unnecessary research and could have written much more on the subject so please ask me about my oysters organizing your fridge i wrote this article about organizing your refrigerator if you saw my fridge you would know two things  i am not an authority on organization  i do not listen to my own advice top  lesserknown horror films one of the hardest things you can ask a movie nerd to do is narrow down a list of his or her top ten while these might not be my favorite scary movies of all time they are my favorite ones that perhaps flew a bit under the radar or seem to have been forgotten my poor heart was broken when the legal department informed us that we could not mention specific movies let alone write an entire article about them so whether you agree or disagree with my list let me know well chat grab some

its father corporate vice president of microsofts office business platform jeff teper isnt a household name at least outside of redmond that doesnt mean teper hasnt left his stamp on past current and future iterations of sharepoint microsofts allinone collaboration and communication server far from it teper is just more of a behindthescenes yet intensely competitive guy who runs a team of several thousand teper joined microsoft in  before he ended up spearheading sharepoint teper was a general manager with msn he has a masters degree in business administration from harvard business school and a bachelors degree in information systems and finance from new york university hes attuned to business matters and dev matters both his team members said sharepoint  due out in mid alongside office  didnt materialize out of nowhere teper and a handful of other microsoft execs helped birth microsofts fastest growing server product back in  teper saw a trend from customers he was in our competitive team recalled tom rizzo a director of marketing in the sharepoint group people had lots of documents and file shares search documents office and the web were all coming together they teper and his colleagues told chairman bill gates and ceo steve ballmer that we needed to invest in this category bringing the idea for sharepoint to gates and ballmer resulted in two different takes from two different highlevel microsoft managers teper reminisced he said gates asked a lot of questions about the longterm architecture sql server net etc behind what evolved into sharepoint gates also asked a lot of usability questions teper said ballmer on the other hand used his classic i dont get this line of questioning to bring sharepoints charter into focus ballmer said we need to make it simple simple simple teper said he wanted to keep the message very simple so how did all this talk about simplicity yield a product that even teper himself acknowledges is quite ambitious and complex he called it this week the ultimate swiss army knife we may have oversold how simple sharepoint was to deploy teper acknowledged but over the last three years and this year in particular theres been a lot of focus from the team around improving sharepoints documentation guidance and training he said throughout the past decade our sharepoint vision has been consistent though the scope has grown teper said even though it had a lot of different names we already were talking about things like social networking back in  we had the idea of giving everyone their own web site we did that before facebook or myspace were launched a great success born from a great failure sharepoint even at the outset was a complex integration project microsofts first pass at it was codenamed tahoe and built on top of the exchange data store tahoe incorporated several technologies microsoft obtained during several strategic acquisitions it bought vermeer and interse the technology which provided the underpinnings for site server and commerce server the resulting product launched in  site server is an example of a great success born from a great failure teper quipped when i asked him about the origins of sharepoint it was a bad user experience the business model wasnt great teper admitted microsoft ended up splitting the original integrated site server product into several independent ones including microsoft biztalk integration server and commerce server which were under satya nadella now one of the kingpings of microsofts search and advertising efforts and teper and his core group of six people or so who began work on the next version of sharepoint which became known as sharepoint server  with sharepoint  microsoft replaced the exchange data store with a sql one microsoft also purchased ncompass labs during this period and integrated its webcontentmanagement technology with sharepoint in  microsoft morphed sharepoint yet again this time developing and realigning it to be

the upgrade process between the  and  versions was anything but smooth the softies acknowledged this week while microsofts sharepoint competitors include some of the biggest enterprise vendors including ibm google and oracle were our own toughest critics teper said he recalled when gates used to send the sharepoint managers frequent and regular emails saying salesforce or facebook or some other competitor has this feature and wanted to know when was microsoft going to have it while microsofts current chief software architect has given the team lots of feedback especially around what its doing with ozzies baby groove he isnt anywhere near as micromanaging as gates it seems ozzie is more narrowly but deeply focused than gates on software plus services teper said ozzie is especially focused on giving the team feedback and help around sharepoints alignment with azure he said the office culture permeates teper cut his management teeth under kurt delbene senior vice president of the office business productivity group and steven sinofsky former head of office engineering who is now the president of the windows client business the reason sharepoint was successful was we used the office development approach said teper we use a collaborative development approach to build a collaborative product and how we organize the team what we look for how we work  its all very officelike

sharepoint realm microsoft hasnt and still doesnt have a monopoly position teper formerly reported to richard case who ran the os compete team for microsoft he was a competitive guy and so is teper teper said its that spirit of feistiness and aggressiveness that really marks the sharepoint team he said another differentiator between sharepoint and office  not to mention a number of other
