leaf health  medicine california free the leaf state of marijuana  a historic state of marijuana conference was held sept – onboard the queen mary the former luxury liner and warship that’s now docked at long beach harbor in california the aim according to organizer susan soares was to cover politics and business on the eve of california’s pending vote on prop  to legalize adult use of marijuana in the state “my hope is that the industry can demonstrate a form of conscious capitalism” soares told npr “you can’t create smart policy if you don’t understand what it is that you’re regulating” among those greeting attendees to the conference was long beach city councilwoman jeannine pearce a texas native who said she’d first tried marijuana when her mother a medical user gave it to her to help with her menstrual cramps you could almost hear queen victoria tipping her teacup at that during the opening plenary session harborside health center’s steve deangelo welcomed the “new wave of professionals” into the industry while reminding us of the sacrifices that had been made by “legacy” businesses “it’s time for industry to step up for human rights” he said pointedlyin his dayone keynote drug policy alliance executive director ethan nadelmann observed “we’re now entering the second generation of drug reform from prop  to now we’ve hit a turning point but it’s like turning around an ocean liner i’ve never actually said that on an ocean liner before” the california adultuse market will more than double the size of the four currently legal states and if the prop  is successful it will reverberate globally nadelmann predicted ncia executive director aaron smith added that if all five adultuse measures pass on nov  more than  congress reps will hail from legal states california’s special issues arcview group ceo troy dayton whose keynote kicked off day two stated that in california and other states where licensing is more open than in canada and the northeast opportunity tends to be in product development and suggested that’s why there is so much investment in california brands mary shapiro of evoke law in san francisco however reminded the crowd that california’s secretary of state alex padilla interprets the law to mean that cannabis products cannot be trademarked unlike in other states because of california’s ceqa and osha requirements the lack of trademark protection and high prices for land utilities and water tax expert matthew portnoff advised attendees to look to other states especially oregon michael stevenson of horizon water and environment who’s conducting an environmental impact review for cannabis in california the first state to do so said local standards will have to sync with the minimum environmental standards established by the state “there’s a chicken or egg happening because locals want to have things up and running” he informed the state plans to start circulating its draft proposals early next year for three input periods assemblyman reggie jonessawyer d–los angeles one of the authors of the state’s medical marijuana regulations that passed last year didn’t hold back when he explained “i plan to personally work with all the people involved so that they regulations are not onerous we want to make sure it’s the next best thing to sliced bread and we want to put oregon and colorado out of business i hope our next president she will be able to make the changes that we need we don’t want them to reschedule we want them to deschedule” surprise guest congressman dana rohrabacher r–ca came wearing a hat that read “make cannabis great again” rohrabacher said he talked to “don trump” who “has told me and others if the states legalize he won’t interfere but of course with don you never know” the evolution of a revolution the “evolution of pot” panel featured jeff raber of the werc shop who called for standardization of the medical market “let’s maximize diversity and terpine profiles accelerated with modern analysis it’s a flexible plant if we bred this way we can breed it the other way” another panelist swami chaitanya who lives on a acre farm in mendocino described the underground cannabis community as “wizards like in harry potter with this sacred knowledge now we’re sharing it with the muggles” many speakers lamented the disappearance of sweetsmelling heirloom varieties which have lost out to market pressures for higher yields maximum thc and selection of less fragrant strains due to nosy neighbors or law enforcement officials longtime grow book author mel frank revealed he had about  landraces in the late ’s but lost nearly all of them “in a legal thing” adding “it’s mythical that there was nothing really strong back then” cultivation consultant david holmes of clade opined that while sungrown marijuana will be a market of its own indoor could lose out to its greenhouse competition he added that it’s difficult to produce quality cannabis in  sq ft grow facilities especially with investors who want to rush to harvest the conference ended with a panel on prop  while drug policy alliance’s manager of marijuana law and policy amanda reiman highlighted the human rights advantages to the proposal hezekiah allen of the california grower’s association cga countered “big ups to dpa on the human justice component they just forgot the economic justice” cga is officially neutral on the measure due to concerns about the lack of protection against full vertical integration and limits on the acreage that can be cultivated california norml has presented a list of proposed legislative fixes to the measure to advance human rights and protect the cottage industry dayton highlighted cannabis businesses that have donated  or more to reform efforts the list includes weedmaps dixie elixirs dr bronner’s advanced nutrients and medmen “cannabis is cause marketing” dayton said “it’s hard to conduct business when you’re not one of the people contributing to the cause there are tens of thousands of people in prison counting on us to get this right and not let our petty disagreements get in the way of getting them out of jail”     if you

right and not let our petty disagreements get in the way of getting them out of jail” right – and jail is not the worst destruction of the fraudulent marijuana prohibition — more than  innocent americans are arrested for simple marijuana possession each year and made secondclass citizens – for life they will forever face large obstacles to decent employment education travel housing government benefits and will always go into court with one strike against them they can even have their children taken away  million americans are now locked away in this very unamerican subclass because of this bogus “criminal” record that has a horrible effect on the whole country being a massive waste of human potential the fraudulent marijuana prohibition has never accomplished one positive thing it has only caused vast amounts of crime corruption violence death and the severe diminishing of everyone’s freedom there is no more important domestic issue than ending what is
