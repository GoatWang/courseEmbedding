resources reported good news that allowed it to buck the broader precious metals downtrend reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer jul   at am what happened gold miner novagold resources inc nysemktng saw its shares advance  in june  which could be viewed as somewhat odd since most precious metals miners ended the month in negative territory for example industry giant newmont mining nyse nem was down about  roughly tracking the downtick in the price of gold but novagolds stock gains largely came after june  when it made a joint announcement with barrick gold nyseabx the big news was that barrick and novagolds  donlin gold joint venture was making good progress in developing what has the potential to be one of the worlds largest pureplay gold mines there are a number of things to like about this project which novagold ceo greg lang explained in the release donlin golds size grade production profile exploration potential mine life community support and jurisdictional safety render it a unique asset in the gold industry image source getty images so what for the roughly  billion market cap barrick this is a nice project to be sure barricks shares were down around  in june joint ventures like this are a way for the giant to expand without taking on all the risks of developing new projects but for  billion market cap novagold its a huge deal novagolds primary assets are its  stake in donlin gold and a  stake in the galore creek project which is expected to produce gold silver and copper in other words this miner isnt currently bringing any gold or other metals out of the ground it needs these two projects to work if it hopes to shift from burning cash to generating it   so the stock price advance after the release was all about investors reacting positively to the news that one of novagolds two key projects looks like its getting closer to actually producing gold now what theres no question that novagold shareholders got some very good news in june that said novagold really remains most appropriate for aggressive gold investors since its currently burning through cash as it works to complete the two joint venture mining projects mentioned above although the donlin project appears to be making good progress until gold starts coming out of the ground theres always a risk that something could go wrong if you are willing to make a wager that everything will work out well however novagold is worth a deep dive   reuben brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has a

materials do contain forwardlooking information and projections that may differ from our actual results please refer to the risks and uncertainties disclosed in our annual report filed on form k for the year ended november   and also other novagold reports and documents filed on sedar and edgar with that i have the pleasure of introducing greg lang novogolds president and ceo greg greg lang thank you melanie good morning everyone today we will be reviewing our second quarter results and providing an update on our two projects our  owned flagship asset donlin gold continues to progress through permitting and is poised to become one of the largest producers in the gold industry galore creek a  partnership with teck is one of the largest undeveloped copper deposits in canada during the second quarter donlin gold continued to work with the army corps of engineers and other cooperating agencies to ensure that all the required information for the final eis was delivered in a timely and complete fashion the corps has scheduled to issue the final eis in early  donlin gold also advanced other major state and federal permit applications and approvals the pipeline and hazardous material safety administration published a public notice initiating that comment period on the request for a permit to construct the natural gas pipeline this comment period closed in june with no substantive comments received the alaska department of environmental quality concluded the comment period for the air quality permit in may and again no substantive comments were received several other major state permit applications were also filed in the second quarter such as the integrated waste management permit and the water discharge permit its very encouraging to see that these permitting activities remain very much on track were thrilled to be advancing the optimization efforts with our partner as shown on slide  the recently announced drill program will capitalize on the flexibility found in donlin golds unique characteristics of large size superior grade and strong exploration potential on the basis of what we know now about the structural controls and the evaluations done to date plus what we know from the original feasibility study grade is clearly on our side as part of the ongoing optimization work more selective mining methods has been identified as an opportunity for improvement additional structural data collection will enhance our understanding of the targeted mineralized zones this opportunity is sufficiently encouraging that the partners have increased the donlin gold budget this year by  and have resumed drilling after seven years to collect additional data that will validate the structural interpretations and support other ongoing optimization work as noted in the quotes on slide  our joint effort is to build the bestinclass not to mention largest pure gold mine in the world but also to do extensively in terms of economics and closely related to that timing so that when donlin will be built only when it will benefit our and barrick shareholders and all other stakeholders patience had supported us to potentially have it all the optimization studies are looking good enough for us to spend some additional money we clearly have a large and remarkable ore body with grades already more than two times the industry average that’s a tremendous advantage when one is laying out the optimal development for a big mine yet both novagold and barrick are striving to do better and optimize its developments that it can be among the largest producers but with lower upfront capital many of the inputs into the feasibility study were at peak prices but there are opportunities beyond that for reduction in capital cost through thirdparty participation in our infrastructure and the leasing of mining equipment with reduced upfront capital cost and exceptional exploration upside our aim is sustaining our production profile as one of the largest gold producers in the world for decades to come this is a remarkable objective but that’s where were heading with this work we view donlin gold as an ore body that will keep on giving and the alignment between the two companies has simply never been better moving to slide  weve have long believed that in order to maintain a social license to operate a company must have a thorough understanding and respect for the language values and culture of the people in the region where our projects are located our work in the region over the last twenty years has been critical in building a foundation of broad community support in the second quarter donlin gold continued village meetings across the yk region donlin was also returning as a principal sponsor and volunteer at the th iditarod trail sled dog race i would like to congratulate all the mushers who participated in this years race with special recognition to pete kaiser who is from the region near the donlin gold project and finished in the top ten donlin also supported aniaks th annual academic decathlon and career fair as well as other activities in the region at galore creek we continue to support various local tahltan community initiatives ill now turn the call over to our cfo david ottewell dave david ottewell thank you greg turning to slide  our share of donlin gold and galore creek funding totaled  sic  million for the second quarter as expected for the full year we expect to spend approximately  million to fund donlin gold and  million to fund galore creek our forecasted spending for the full year at donlin gold has increased by  million as a result of the recently announced drill program slide  highlights our second quarter operating performance for the quarter we reported a  million operating loss and an  million net loss as expected and similar to the prior year quarter the operating loss and net loss for the first six months were also consistent with the prior year as our activities continue to focus on donlin gold permitting novagolds cash flow highlights are outlined on slide  during the second quarter of  we spent  million of which  million was used to fund our share of the donlin gold and galore creek project and  million was used for administrative costs net of working capital and interest we ended the quarter with cash and term deposits of  million finally on slide  weve increased our  budget from  million to  million including our  million share of the drill program at donlin gold we expect to end the year with approximately  million in cash and term deposits greg back to you greg lang thank you dave ill quickly recap the attributes that make the donlin project unique and why we have focused this company solely on donlin in terms of size donlin is an immense endowment its size and production profile clearly distinguish it from its peers on slide  the grade donlin is a highgrade open pit mine many new mines have been built on grades of about a  gram donlin is better than twice those grades and its the grade where the industry was  years ago donlin will be a large scale producer as envisioned in the feasibility study well produce  million ounces in its first five years followed by decades of an average of  million ounces a year this is substantially bigger than any of the other emerging producers on slide  the reserve pit as shown in the white border on the left hand side of the diagram contains the currently defined  million ounces of measured and indicated resources at donlin gold when the time is right we will tap into donlins gold potential along strike and at depth and test other targets as shown on the diagram at dome quartz and snow donlin has positive returns in the current price environment as highlighted on slide  these returns become robust as the bull market in gold resumes one of the unique attributes that donlin has is that its on private land owned by two alaskanative corporations theyve been vocal advocates for the project through our permitting theyre supporting our plans and encouraging us to go forward with the project were nearing the completion of permitting permitting in the united states is a rigorous disciplined project in the last few years weve spent advancing through permitting is nothing in the context of a mine whose life is measured in decades our galore project on its own is a substantial endowment of copper gold and silver and it is among the highest grade undeveloped copper deposits in the world and when the time is right well sell it to further strengthen our balance sheet to advance donlin as evidenced by our top shareholders were in institutional quality investment in the gold developers many of our top shareholders have been with the company for years and were appreciative of their continued support to wrap it up for the last few years weve been focusing our resources on one unwavering strategy to advance and derisk donlin gold in order to provide the most attractive ways for our shareholders to profit from the next phase of the longterm bull market in gold im proud to report that yearafteryear weve been successful in executing on our stated objectives without interruption we believe that this is the most important gold development project in the world and were making material and indeed exciting progress on all fronts operator we can now open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions our first question is from john bridges of jp morgan your line is open john bridges i just wanted to  good to hear that youre drilling up presumably the higher grade targets for this optimization study just wondering if you can give us a bit more detail on what youre trying to do with that and what sort of shape of projects you might come up with greg lang john first off i love drilling its one of the most exciting activities that the company can undertake and its great to be doing it after a long break weve been working with barrick indepth on this project its really almost from the ground up understanding the geology the mineralization controls and looking at various opportunities large scale mining operation inherently has higher dilution with smaller mining equipment you can take advantage of the tighter structural controls so weve got some pretty exciting theories in that regard and the best way to test the theory is to get out and drill and were really sufficiently excited by the opportunity that in these rather capital challenged times were willing to invest additional money and well  as the results come in well certainly update everybody on what they mean to the project john bridges so is geotechnical drilling to figure out if you can be more selective with the mining or more geology to find out where the high grades portions of the ore body exists greg lang yes the program has multiple objectives john well be collecting additional geotechnical work see if theres opportunities for example steeper pit walls we will be testing some of the structures and even collecting additional hydrologic data so its a pretty broad program just targeted on enhancing our understanding in the ore body and flushing out some of the opportunities that may lead to enhanced grade john bridges and its good to hear that the permitting is advancing and according to plan with no objections so thats great and congratulations and look forward to hearing q and maybe some drill results can you give us some information along the way or are you going to keep it all close to your chest greg lang well well work with our partner on the timing of releasing the data john but were certainly glad to be drilling operator thank you our next question is from david luchenski ph an investor your line is open sir unidentified analyst greg just a few questions its hard for me to understand how novagolds market cap is  billion and yet you own an asset thats worth  billion and how the market doesnt recognize that it means youre undervalued by a factor of   times how do you feel about that greg lang well i would be very pleased if you were  if that was indeed the case i think gold developers are valued i think based on the assets of their gold in the ground and the quality of their deposits when i look at our peer groups i think were appropriately valued now but i think certainly as we continue to advance the project and further derisk it through permitting and ultimately take the project forward i think youre correct the value of our shares will multiply as we become  get through permitting and into development and certainly as a producer with endowment of over  million assets i think theres certainly a room to run for the shares unidentified analyst yes to me youre  stock all day long the permit when do you expect  i think on one of the previous conference calls you said the first quarter of  is that your target greg lang yes the army corps of engineers who is the lead federal agency involved with the permitting keeps an uptodate website you can look  find the donlin gold eis and they have stated that they will publish the final eis in march of next year and issue a record of decision approximately three to four months later so were  give or take a year away from finishing up the federal permitting process and while were working our way through that is noted on the call were pursuing the other various state and federal permits that are necessary for the operation but clearly the environmental impact study is the largest and most time consuming part of this process unidentified analyst and another question would you ever consider paying dividends in bullion instead of  and that could be done through the intermediaries by having wholesale coin dealers ship bullion to stockholders would you ever consider something like that greg lang david thats certainly an interesting idea and were quite a ways from it but… unidentified analyst i know i just invite you to think about it thats all greg lang when the time is right wed love to be a dividend paying company unidentified analyst okay –here is the last question i have your legal department im sure youve quite a few law firms involved what is your opinion of the naked short so theyre down on the comex in the past weeks youve had  youve had  billion of naked shorts dumped at market not limit orders market orders and then you had within the last five days another  billion of naked shorts through the banks do you  does that smell bad to you it smells bad to me i mean do you  it seems like its totally manipulated the price of gold and with the prejudice to you and barrick and everybody else what is your opinion of that greg lang well i  over the last couple of months we were part of the gdxj and when they announced the rebalancing of the index we certainly saw a lot of downward pressure on our stock and higher than normal volumes i think with this gdxj rebalancing behind us just in the last week were seeing shares trade in the pattern that were used to seeing them trade which is largely in concert with gold price and on news as the company progresses through its projects unidentified analyst but who adopts ph  billion at market i mean most investors would have limit orders i mean it just  what hedge fund or it just  do you have any  i guess here is my question do you have any suspicion that the gold price is being artificially slammed because quite frankly its the only thermostat for foul play in the financial arena greg lang david we appreciate your thoughtprovoking questions but as a matter of practice we dont really comment on trading in our shares and i do note were a fairly liquid stock and i think that invites high frequency trading but i dont see anything sinister in any of it it all looks given our circumstances pretty normal operator thank you operator instructions i see no other questions in queue id like to turn it back to mr lang for closing remarks greg lang all right well everyone thank you for joining our call this morning and we look forward to keeping you update as we progress with our drilling and permitting activities

with its plans and activities as it goes through the process of permitting and developing donlin novagold is going through the permitting process for the donlin gold project in a very methodical way while also making sure the community is informed and involved in the project the us army corps of engineers is overseeing the process for the environmental impact statement and is now reviewing the comments from the public comment period various permits are also being advanced with state and federal agencies�such as water discharge wetlands air quality water use and fish habitat permits and other approvals that will give them rightofway access meanwhile novagold has been very engaged in community outreach among local stakeholders the work and benefit from that effort cannot be underestimated novagold has made it a priority and rightly so to involve the local community from early on in the project thats a good thing for investors waiting to realize the tremendous value that resides in the donlin gold resource with its  million ounces and while most of managements effort to realize value is focused on the donlin gold project it appears to us that investors have totally
