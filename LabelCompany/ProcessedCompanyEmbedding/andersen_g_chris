on businesses of all sizes and across all industries the world is also changing in other fundamental ways it is becoming smaller flatter faster and smarter and going from analog to digital naturally the digital culture has changed many investment banks one of the causalities of these changes has been the role of the trusted investment banking advisor dramatically affected by this change is a segment critically important to gc andersen partners middle market companies with less than  billion dollars of annual revenues the middle market is often referred to as ‘the engine of the economy’ generating a disproportionate share of gdp patents jobs and wealth historically this segment had a core of investment banks devoted to helping middle market companies grow in the recent past firms like alex brown donaldson lufkin jenrette drexel burnham lambert hambrecht  quist and robertson stephens covered this market and enabled many middle market companies to reach their fullest potential often through stunning combinations of creativity innovation and a belief in clients that was almost messianic these firms are gone having either consolidated or disappeared altogether the remaining firms serving the middle market that have appeared in their place are apparently often consigned to developing their brands and businesses one deal at a time and flogging themselves on blogs chat rooms and conference rooms they are small and they seem even smaller without world class perspective market proven results or “clientfirst” commitment modern business is a series of complex equations and hourly realtime challenges there are more choices more regulations and more public opinion to consider there are fewer brand names which bring certainty of success while many are grappling with a mountain of conflicting data and opinions the large firms with multiple lines of business often overlapping with client interests and goals make for an environment where conflicts can occur clients

bleakley published january   except for a handful of financial mavericks such as the legendary sidney weinberg robert lehman and andre meyer wall street investment bankers were for years wedded to longterm fixedrate bonds straight common stock and a handful of other financial standbys not anymore nowadays theres a proliferation of innovative deals and a new breed of investment bankers to dream them up there is a special class of investment bankers whose job is to perceive change and exploit it says prof samuel hayes of the harvard business school typically in their s with several years of experience in specialized areas of the capital markets they are innovating across the whole spectrum of finance they hold titles such as director of new product development and they command salaries that while not approaching the multimilliondollar checks that flow to wall streets top traders are far into the sixdigit figures they rely heavily on computers to design new types of securities and they keep tabs on what competitors offer so that they can add new features to a popular bond the innovators are stoking the fires of a competitive battle among investment bankers no longer can the firms count on repeat business ever since  when the federal reserve board decided to let interest rates fluctuate more sharply corporations have been increasingly willing to embrace any deal  and any investment banking firm  that attracts investors away from shortterm money market instruments virtually every firm now has a new product think tank last summer shearson lehmanamerican express formally set up a new product development group and a few months ago paine webber hired a vice president from smith barney harris upham  company to head a new products group such units have been prolific ten years ago david m darsts the complete bond book described  fixedincome instruments this fall mr darst counted no less than  alternative financing methods most of the new deals however are variations on old themes they are blends of features  yields convertability cost and the like  that have proved popular with investors according to mr darst with a bit more initiative  and a lot more use of computers  the product developers could devise deals that pinpoint even better mixes of old features just a little bit of artificial intelligence programming would give them the ability to analyze which elements of a deal are most popular he said he also notes that the product developers seem to pay little attention to the blends of features that have proved appealing overseas or in the taxexempt municipal market there are a lot of unique muni deals but the taxable new product guys are like yuppies who will pass by a flea market and miss a bargain he said even if they are just scratching the surface new product developers are a powerful force in the financial world the following four men have been responsible for a number of the markets new deals and are typical of this new breed of investment banker g chris andersen drexel burnham lambert due to a learning disability g chris andersen a yearold managing director of drexel burnham lambert is by his own admission a tremendously poor reader who literally doesnt know his left hand from his right he also is by all accounts one of the most creative investment bankers on wall street among his inventions are a sunshine mining company bond issued in  in which principal at maturity would be the higher price of either  or  ounces of silver a bevy of variations in the junk high yield bond market and last months unusual initial public offering of the arley merchandise corporation if chris is one of four investment bankers in a room the other three may come up with one usable idea each chris will have seven said fred joseph head of investment banking at drexel burnham mr andersen firmly believes in financial alchemy  that debt issues can be made to take on equity characteristics and vice versa it was the combination of equity with debt that enabled arley to go public see box mr andersen said he could have added even more bells and whistles to the offering if the company had agreed it could have been my ultimate gee whiz he sighs his penchant for innovation stems in part from the liberal eduation he received as an army brat who lived in  states and  countries before the age of  you learn to keep an open mind mr andersen said part of his education he added was running with london street gangs in the mids he toyed with the idea of becoming a boxer until a detroit street gang taught him he wasnt as tough as he thought despite his learning disability mr andersen won academic scholarships to the university of colorado and to northwestern universitys graduate school of business what he calls an

sungeun hanandersen member campaign executive committee and international advisory board cochair campaign kickoff campaign volunteer sungeun hanandersen cfa’ has lived in many worlds both geographically and professionally she grew up in seoul south korea where—as a child piano prodigy—she attended music schools she moved with her family to the new york area in  when she was a junior in high school to attend the julliard school’s precollege program after spending a summer at bu’s tanglewood institute she decided to enroll at bu’s college of fine arts “i loved the boston area” she recalls “when i was young i saw the movie love story i had pretty romantic ideas about boston” originally a composition major hanandersen surprised everyone—including herself—by winning a piano competition as a freshman she became a performance major spending many hours in cfa’s basement practice rooms “half my waking hours” she recalls “i was very disciplined but those practice rooms were terrible” a balanced life after graduating from bu hanandersen enrolled in a doctoral program at the manhattan school of music gradually though she began worrying that her life was too narrow first taking a research job with price waterhouse in london—and not telling her parents for two years that she had stepped off the performance track—she discovered the world of management consulting “it was a freeing experience” she says of that momentous change “i got to have a more balanced life” that trend continued after she married investment banker g chris andersen who encouraged her to give up her fivedayaweek consultant’s travel schedule to manage a new family foundation two of the foundation’s major gifts harked back to an earlier phase of hanandersen’s life grants to both the college of fine arts and the manhattan school of music to build stateoftheart practice rooms for their students “so many bu alumni are grateful for the education they received there and so many want to be reconnected with the university” —sungeun hanandersen hanandersen has also given freely of her time to boston university elected a trustee of the university in  she sits on bu’s international advisory board iab and has helped launch the campaign for boston university both in boston and at the recent dubai international kickoff “dubai was an amazing experience” she says “especially the iab sessions how often do you get to meet the crown prince of abu dhabi get driven around in a sensordriven car without a driver and then have dinner out in the desert under the stars” hanandersen officially retired from the concert circuit last year giving her more time to devote to new artistic pursuits and to the family’s acre farm dedicated to training and boarding horses “that also closes a circle for me” she explains “my bu piano teacher maria clodes jaguaribe had a horse at her home she would take me home before recitals and let me groom the horse which i found very relaxing i started to ride in london and i’ve been working with horses ever since i love them” person by person is she surprised at the success of bu’s campaign to date “no” she says “not at all so many bu alumni are grateful for the education they received there and so many want to be reconnected with the university that’s how we will succeed person by person” share this one comment on volunteer spotlight lynne harding october

july   photograph by sung anderson share g chris andersen is in the premier league of wall street investment bankers and financial magicians having crafted intricate breathtaking transactions for major companies around the world he is known for unknotting complex economic situations and digging hard for the next big thing in the most unusual places that leads us to pigs andersen may also be on track to enter the elite ranks of pig farmers in a country that has taken locavore sensibility to a new level but that does not mean his financial model is even rational at this point andersen’s wife sung has told him that she would not cotton to his pigs dragging them squealing into bankruptcy let’s start at the beginning andersen founded gc andersen partners an investment banking firm with offices on park avenue and in los angeles after years of deals at paine webber and drexel burnham lambert he also founded møsefund farm in the northwestern corner of new jersey its beautiful landscape intended as a gentleman farmer’s weekend retreat and horse boarding and training center with sung managing the horse side of things none of this is out of the ordinary for a man of means and things likely would have continued on their usual leisurely course except for the us government you see andersen had tasted jamón ibérico the paperthin slices of spanish aged ham found in the tapas bars of barcelona and was captivated addicted and unable to find it in new york city “i can get anything in new york” he says indignantly “but not jamón thanks to the then import restrictions by the usda” like most things that get andersen’s attention this began a quest “i can raise a pig i can make this stuff” was the mantra with the help of his chef peter lambert pig  was born and raised — a yorkshire long the standardgrade commodity pig we know in the us except this one ate chestnut flour and goat’s milk “the result was better than a factoryraised pig but not what i was looking for” says andersenfrom our partners at vice pig  was berkshire stock although sung thought it was a greatlooking hog she effectively ran andersen and his experiment off the farm as the new stock of pigs was disrupting the serenity of her horses he moved the pigs up the road to a smaller piece of land he owned rebuilt the barn as a piggery and continued the quest “twopointoh was better but still not enough pigginess to the pig” ‘pig  was better but still not enough pigginess to the pig’ more experimentation more capital costs with andersen purchasing tools for the local golf club groundskeepers to gather acorns for his pigs this begins to sound like a very sensible investment banker taking very unsound financial steps to get his own personal stash of ham “as an economic model it was absolutely insane” he says having known andersen for some  years i would parse this to be his intellectual love of the hunt he is after a solution not just the meat this is in fact his natural drive to closing a deal sometime during  andersen’s thennew chef michael clampffer heard about the mangalitsa pig the mangalitsa is a heritage animal raised by the imperial hapsburgs in hungary in the s cultured on the stock of german wild boar it is obese marbled with fat and from all accounts results in pork so good it sings like filet mignon in your mouth one variation møsefund now raises is called a swallow belly sporting long curly hair and black toenails the key here is that the iberian blackfooted pig source of the coveted spanish jamón is a descendent of the european wild boar with the mangalitsa being the other branch of the family tree so andersen was on target as far as evolution was concerned we are now at pig  pig  had some handson attention andersen did a pig tour of spain meeting his iconic animal facetoface he ate acorns in the forest with them and saw them eat  pounds of nuts a day pig  had some handson attention andersen did a pig tour of spain meeting his iconic animal facetoface he ate acorns in the forest with them and saw them eat  pounds of nuts a day “they literally pig out” he says not so tongueincheek back at møsefund farm he and michael set to finetuning the feeding of his drove of s adding barley to the mix of acorns the magic ingredient in the feed for kobe beef in  møsefund was producing something very different according to andersen “better tasting the betterforyou red meat” the mangalitsa has the highest concentration of monounsaturated fat of any domesticated animal which led auburn university to conduct studies on the mangalitsa looking for keys to defeating diabetes and heart disease in humans this too is a serious part of the equation for andersen a humanly beneficial piece in the entire puzzle of his quest but the economics are still problematic and the entire history of american agriculture comes to play andersen needs to sell the whole pig in spite of the good prices for his collars chops and bacon he gets from manhattan restaurants to make sound economic sense of the process ham the starting point of this quest is the hangup “it takes four years to build a mangalitsa ham” he says “and the big issue in the end is one for all artisanal farmers you need to slaughter the pig in the right way” but the right way is not readily available due to the large consolidated slaughterhouses and their needy corporate clients the mangalitsa needs to be scalded its long hair taken off not skinned like factory pork with less than  animals and maybe  at a time ready for slaughter the only slaughterhouse he has found where it can be properly killed cut and cured is in missouri — a hike from the new jersey farm to date the economics do not balance andersen carries on his cell phone a photograph of a møsefund mangalitsa chop he is erudite about the history the facts of pig farming proud of it and not without a sense of humor about a wall street guy not a farmer coming into the country he has formed the mangalitsa breeders association and sits as its first chairman when i ask about the irony of starting down the labyrinthian path to jamón and then not being able to get a ham out of the deal i also state the obvious — that he must have had at least one ham from  “i have had a ham or two made for myself” he replies and “pretty goddamn good” hamfisted banker forks over big
