congressman follows trump�s lead refuses to comply with court order by matthew chapman  july   montanas new congressman greg gianforte is refusing to cooperate with law enforcement despite pleading guilty to assault montana rep greg gianforte thinks hes above the law ap photobobby caina calvan these actions add yet more fuel to the fire for those accusing trump of obstruction of justice and may actually have emboldened mueller but most of all they paint a picture of a man who is supremely unconcerned about the rule of law and considers it beneath him  and trump�s devilmaycare attitude toward the law may be having real consequences other republican politicians have recently taken to flouting what is legally required of them and few more brazenly than newly elected montana rep greg gianforte recently gianforte made national news for violently bodyslamming guardian reporter ben jacobs after being asked a question about the gop health care bill he went on to win the election anyway the next day but admitted wrongdoing and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault he was fined and sentenced to community service and anger management despite being caught dead to rights however gianforte is bizarrely refusing to come in to the county jail for his mugshot and fingerprinting he has been defying a court order to do so for a month and his lawyers are absurdly trying to argue it does not apply to him because he technically was not arrested past time for the county to arrest him for contempt of court  tweet  replies  viewsthread infobookmark this threadtrash this thread reply

delegates before a candidate forum in helena mont greg gianforte speaks with republican delegates before a candidate forum in helena mont matt volz  associated press kurtis leecontact reporter he’s a wealthy software entrepreneur known for his brash persona and political ambitionsand as election day neared greg gianforte seemed a shooin to win a special election for montana’s lone congressional seatbut as voters headed to the polls thursday questions swirled about his candidacy would gianforte face backlash from those casting ballots after he was charged with assaulting a reporter or would voters look the other way might some even silently cheer the altercation captured on audiotapea day earlier gianforte allegedly grabbed and slammed to the ground a reporter from the guardian newspaper after he asked gianforte about healthcare at the republican’s campaign headquarters late wednesday night gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault by the gallatin county sheriff’s officefor those in montana a bastion of conservatism where republicans have held the state’s lone congressional seat for  years gianforte has been a familiar figure for years primarily as a businessman in  he founded rightnow technologies a software company based in bozeman after operating it as a private enterprise gianforte who employed nearly  people sold it to oracle in  for nearly  billiongianforte  had donated to political campaigns in the past and decided to enter politics with a run for governor last year from the getgo his relationship with the news media was strained at his campaign kickoff event gianforte refused to take any questions from reporterseven after gianforte won the republican nomination for governor his disdain for answering reporters’ questions continued he would avoid journalists at town halls and meetandgreets with voterswhen president trump tapped thenrep ryan zinke to lead the department of interior gianforte saw another political opportunity he entered the special election this spring and his relationship with the media remained tense as ever mark z barabak it’s election day in montana after a wild  hours with voters deciding who will fill the house

it’s election day in montana after a wild  hours with voters deciding who will fill the house seat vacated when republican ryan zinke left to head the interior department under president trump the contest thursday has drawn nationwide attention and an extraordinary amount of money — and that mark z barabak in april gianforte joked about ganging up on a reporter at town hall with hundreds of supporters the move drew criticism from rob quist gianforte’s democratic rival for the open seata day after the republican’s clash with the guardian reporter three major local newspapers — the missoulian the billings gazette and the independent record in helena — withdrew their endorsements of gianforte“we wouldnt condone it if it happened in a home or even a latenight bar fight and we couldnt accept it from a man who is running to become montanas lone congressional representative” the billings gazette said in an editorialthe missoulian wrote “there is no doubt that gianforte committed an act of terrible judgment that if it doesn’t land him in jail also shouldn’t land him in the us house of representatives”“he showed … that he lacks the experience brains and abilities to effectively represent montana in any elected office” the editorial addedmontana has been something of an anomaly among red states although it is republicanleaning there is a broad populist streak going back to the robber baron days of the states copper kings and the right kind of democrat — one seen as autonomous from washington and attuned to the states gunloving culture — can win political office after all the man who defeated gianforte in the race for governor steve bullock is a democrateven so gianforte lost to bullock by less than  percentage points and polls have showed him as the frontrunner in the special election would montanans be willing to overlook the assault citation in some quarters the answer is yes“this hasn’t changed my view at all” said kyle nielsen who has owned grains of montana restaurant  bakery in billings for  yearshe had cast an absentee ballot for gianforte and didn’t regret it “i’m waiting for more information… i do think news reports can be biased against republicans” he said “we need more information”nielsen  said that while he’s not a registered republican he tends to vote for conservatives because he believes they understand the needs of smallbusiness owners nielsen said his wife and two adult children also supported gianforte last year they all voted for trump“we’ve seen how the media likes to battle trump and republicans every day and this is nothing new” nielsen saiddave hunter a democratic strategist who has spent decades in montana politics summed up gianforte’s chances“greg gianforte is a damaged product and not very appealing to very many montanans” hunter said “but the fact that hes a republican is probably more important than any of that to a lot of those voters” caption arizona sen john mccain has been

monday fit gianforte’s crime lambert called the sentence “just” and said that gianforte’s “honesty and forthrightness” after the altercation will allow montanans to “put all this behind us and move forward” reported the bozeman daily chronicle “i don’t think mr gianforte had to go to jail to reinforce the need for him not to engage in that type of behavior again” lambert said according to the daily chronicle “i think that sentence was fair” though all sides including the judge maintained in court monday that gianforte was treated no differently than any other misdemeanor offender the

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
