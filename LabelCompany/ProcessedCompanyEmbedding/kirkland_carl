stores across  states see how our story began and how you can help us turn the next page how we started a small gift shop with a unique vision the retail industry is practically in carl kirklands blood the cofounder was raised in his familys clothing store in union city tn at a young age he was put in charge of the boy scout department and had his first handson experience merchandising in  carl opened a franchised gift shop in old hickory mall in jackson tn where he perfected his ability to find and merchandise stylish items at even more stylish prices at about the same time carls cousin robert kirkland did the same in nashville tn both men found success with their downtoearth business model offer customers trendy items at great prices then keep new and unique products flowing into the store to please the customer with fresh ideas for her home how we transformed from gift shop to home decor leader in the late s the two men began traveling abroad to find oneofakind items that werent being sold in other decor and gift shops during the years to come kirklands evolved from a gift shop to a home decor retailer and moved away from being a mallbased operation for most retailers this is a tough transition but kirklands never strayed from the founders mission to offer the latest styles at a great price which has led to more than  years of success in the home decor and gift market in  kirklands detached from its mall roots and transitioned more than  stores out of their mall locations and into more accessible shopping centers this has allowed kirklands to expand the size and mix of merchandise making it easier for customers to purchase larger items for their homes like lounges couches and vanity sets who we are today a home decor leader that inspires in the
