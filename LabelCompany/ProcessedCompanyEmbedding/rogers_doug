results were a silver medal in the  tokyo olympics and gold medals at two pan american games in  and  he was a student of masahiko kimura contents  biography  post olympics  see also  references  further reading  external links biographyedit doug rogers arrived in japan in  at the age of  with the specific intention of working on his judo as a youth he had won the ontario minor hockey championships where he finished the tournaments the highestscoring defenceman at age  he had joined the judo club at the montreal ymca it was not long before his sensei there told him there was nothing left for him to teach and directed him over to fred okimuras montreal seidokan dojo he continued practicing while in high school winning the eastern canada brown belt ikkyu title in  the following year he won the black belt title although rogers was accepted by mcgill university having been accepted to the kodokan rogers boarded a plane for japan in  the best judo competitors at the time in japan were coming out of the police academy and universities these competitors would visit the kodokan for practice on a weekly basis training at the kodokan rogers made an effort to train with the judoka from the police academy and nearby takushoku university takudai it was in this way that he got to meet masahiko kimura who was the coach of takudai university and one of its most famous alumni able to hold his own against top judoka in japan the canadian olympic committee in search of medal hopefuls and moreover pleased that he was already in japan where the olympics were to be held recruited rogers rogers decided however to return to canada to compete in the national championships and the olympic committee were at first reluctant to pay for rogers airfare back to japan eventually they settled for paying a oneway ticket rogers day at the olympics is best described by frank moritsugu a contemporary of his with coach frank hatashita at matside on that october  day at the budokan doug had an easy time in the early rounds in the semis he clearly decisioned a tough opponent the bulllike soviet competitor p chikviladze eliminating one of the possible winners then came the heavy weight finals where his opponent was isao inokuma the alljapan champion inokuma was shorter and many pounds lighter but much more experienced and perhaps japans supreme judo technician and he was an occasional training partner of rogers at the kodokan theirs was a hardfought match which we watched agonizingly on our tv sets here in canada neither man could throw the other cleanly although both managed to complete throws which ended off the tatami at the end of a truly championship bout it was a narrow decision for inokuma but with his silver medal doug rogers had become canadas first judoka to mount the olympic medal podium at the first olympics where judo was included post olympicsedit after the olympics rogers trained fulltime with kimura and the takudai team in the summer of  rogers participated in the alljapan university championships as a member of the takushoku university team and helped them bring the winners penant back to takudai for the first time in several years not only was doug the first nonasian foreigner to take part in this tournament he was also named the tournaments best fighter rogers felt very close to kimura regarded him as a father figure and stayed in touch with him until his death in  kimura demanded a very high level of physical fitness and concentrated on training simple strong judo moves his training style was somewhat informal compared to the strict etiquette and bowing rituals practiced in the western world to this day kimura often came onto the mats in sweat pants and threw on a judogi only as needed to demonstrate a technique despite being encouraged by kimura to stay another year rogers decided to return to canada to pursue becoming a professional pilot having attained a private operators licence at age  after a summer tour with the takudai team to a number of japanese universities rogers left japan in  seen off by his teammates carrying their winners pennants and by his coach masahiko kimura doug rogers went on to win gold at two panamerican games and several canadian national championships another mark of his judo skill is his taking of th place at the  olympics despite having been out of serious training for many years once in canada he was spending hours a day in a cockpit rather than on the mats he no longer had kimura as a coach nor did he have the quality of practice opponents that a world champion needed rogers is now retired from a career as an airline pilot he is married with four grown children although less active in judo today he still frequents local tournaments and from time to time is an invited guestcoach at clubs throughout greater vancouver british columbia see alsoedit judo in canada list of canadian judoka referencesedit  a b degeer vern  october  good
