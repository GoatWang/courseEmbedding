nspx treating cancer technology home technology oncology primary tumor organ confined more traditional approaches surgery radiation therapy are largely ineffective for metastatic cancers chemotherapy is widely used for metastatic disease but has serious drawbacks such as toxic effects on normal tissues development of resistance and little effect on slowgrowing cells in the tumor many approaches have been attempted to “target” the delivery of cancer drugs to limit these drawbacks metastasis spread to other parts of the body these approaches have generally met with limited success due to factors such as targeted delivery systems still ‘leak’ the cancer drug out into the blood stream andor struggle to deliver high enough concentrations to the tumor “angiogenesis inhibitors” that aim to cut off blood supply to tumors only block new blood vessels growing – slowing but not reversing tumor growth development of resistance and ineffectiveness against slowlydividing tumor cells are still

development of prodrug cancer therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors including liver brain prostate renal and other cancers a prodrug is an inactive precursor of a drug that is converted into its active form only at the site of the tumor its technology platform combines a plantderived cytotoxin thapsigargin with a prodrug delivery system that targets the release of the drug within the solid tumor its cancer prodrugs provide a targeted therapeutic approach to a range of solid tumors with fewer side effects than those related to chemotherapy treatments its product candidates include mipsagargin g g and gmipsagarginthe companys lead drug candidate mipsagargin formerly g is activated by the enzyme prostate specific membrane antigen psma which is found in prostate epithelial cells in the normal prostate in prostate cancer cells and in vascular endothelial cells blood vessels found in solid tumors mipsagargin is in phase ii clinical evaluation in glioblastoma patients the company has completed a phase iaib dose escalation safety tolerability and dose refinement study of mipsagargin in which it treated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma hcc or liver cancer in addition the company has completed a phase ii clinical trial of mipsagargin in patients with liver cancer the company also opened enrollment for its phase ii prostate clinical trial titled g an openlabel singlearm phase ii study to evaluate the safety and activity of g administered in the neoadjuvant setting followed by radical prostatectomy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostategthe companys product candidate g is activated by the enzyme prostate specific antigen psa which is secreted by prostate epithelial cells in the normal prostate and by prostate cancer cells psa is found in the bloodstream and is a known tumor marker for prostate cancer but it is inactive in the bloodstream due to potent binding by a protein inhibitor g is in preclinical developmentgthe
