licensing products is the ultimate side hustle you dont have to quit your day job to start earning recurring revenue from your ideas by stephen key stephen key is an awardwinning inventor and entrepreneur who has licensed more than  products he is the cofounder of inventright a company that teaches people how to license their ideas and the author of one simple idea turn your dreams into a licensing goldmine while letting others do the work he lives in glenbrook nevada stephenkeymedia cofounder inventrightstephenkeymedia write a comment credit getty images looking back when i started teaching people how to bring their ideas to market without starting a business i had no idea where it would lead i just saw a need i could meet at the inventors groups i attended i was surprised to discover that most people were failing they had built expensive workslike lookslike prototypes and filed nonprovisional patent applications but their ideas werent any closer to retail at that point i had been licensing my ideas for products and collecting royalties in return for many years after reflecting on my success i broke my strategy down into ten simple steps and created an educational program with my business partner andrew krauss if i could do this  with absolutely no formal training and few skills to speak of  so could anyone we reasoned and we were right tim ferriss who would go on to write the bestselling hour workweek and inspire an entire generation to conceive of their lives differently was one of our first students at the time i wasnt quite sure what to make of his intense interest now i get it ferriss was fascinated by my methods because i had essentially hacked a system i had broken the mold i had found a way to bring my ideas to market without starting a business building perfect prototypes or filing costly patents how by making simple improvements to existing products and showing those improvements to companies that manufactured similar goods what did they think i wanted to know and quickly thats what selling my ideas on the street at art fairs and festivals had taught me the truth about the companies you buy products from they need our ideas they want to hear from us open innovation is thriving globally across a swath of industries because it makes good business sense in fact nearly all of the companies i interviewed at toy fair in new york city and the international home  housewares show in chicago this year agreed the time and effort it takes to sort through outside submissions from everyday people and product developers who dont work for them is worth it because thats where their next great idea might come from why not look modern technologies have made licensing ideas easier than when i got started today i think product licensing is the ultimate side hustle actually why because licensing is your ticket to playing the biggest game in the world all without the financial risk of starting a business but the same rush of adrenaline excitement and uncertainty that accompany launching any new product think about it am i a little biased sure consumer products have always captivated me the same goes for the concept of passive income but how can you argue with the following facts  you dont have to quit your day job to succeed at it  at least not at first anyway are you satisfied working for someone else from  to  if you have dreams and aspirations that are not being met and love being creative you should consider licensing as a business model it enables you to leverage the power of large companies to get to market very quickly essentially you are getting large companies working for you that may sound overblown but its true if your licensee is using their marketing administration manufacturing and sales people to sell your product and pay you royalties they are in essence working for you how cool is that my students are able to license their ideas by working in the morning at lunch in the evening and on the weekends  it emphasizes speed to market in this day and age speed to market is more important than ever its really one of the only ways to head off copycats at the pass if you partner with a large company that has a great distribution retailers wont stock metoo products that compete with yours as a strategy licensing is all about opening up a dialogue and getting the critical feedback you need to refine your concept into the most marketable product possible if you innovate alone in a vacuum you could find yourself wasting years on an idea that ultimately goes nowhere it happens all the time unfortunately  it requires little to no financial risk you can license a simple idea using a sell sheet and perceived ownership in others words you dont need to raise a lot of money to get started let alone mortgage your home benefits are what motivate companies to license an idea not prototypes not patents  you can work when you want to most of us want more flexibility out of our workweek with licensing thats possible you can study a market stimulate your creativity communicate with freelancers from around the world and contact companies over linkedin during any time of the day how cool is that i asked david fedewa who recently received a hefty royalty check from one of his licensed products why hes so passionate about the licensing lifestyle full disclosure before he became inventrights advanced negotiations coach fedewa was my student royalties are typically paid quarterly but per his agreement fedewa received an annual check for this product when my side hustle started paying my mortgage it changed my life he exclaimed developing products and working hard is finally paying off in a way i could not have imagined with other side hustles fedewa said typically the more time you spend at them the more money you make theres a direct relationship between time and money in other words as far as licensing is concerned thats just not the case if youre smart have a decent idea and can consistently execute the ratio between the time you put in and what you get paid is not in balance granted it takes to time to learn how to do this but once you know how to get your product to the right people in the right way it wont take you much time at all fedewa said the possibilities are endless its actually best to do this when you have a day job and not as a fulltime business he emphasized historically the gotomarket model taught at the university level and elsewhere is to start a business thankfully thats changing not everyone has the money skill time or even the desire to start a business which is fine more than fine actually because licensing is a fantastic alternative you can still marvel at the joy of seeing your dream come to life on store shelves so what are you waiting for its time to get your side hustle on for more on licensing as a side hustle listen to my interview with nick loper on his excellent podcast side hustle nation the opinions expressed

tony ballard is a guy who knew in high school that one day he would become a coach a teacher and motivator for kids playing the quarterback position he learned the true meaning of working hard from
