hanson plc defunct  headquarters bath somerset key people victor benjamin chairman dennis webb ceo beazer was a family business for six generations before expanding in the s into international housing construction and building materials group after becoming overburdened with debt it was rescued by hanson plc in  a new beazer group comprising solely the uk housebuilding business was demerged from hanson in  and bought by persimmon plc in  contents  history  early days  the acquisition years  references historyedit early daysedit the six generations mentioned above can easily be traced with the help of the census george beazer born c refer  and  england census was living in the little village of marshfield just outside chipping sodbury and the beazers stayed there for several generations george’s son henry  was the first to be designated a mason as was joseph  and then jesse  jesse’s work consisted largely of repairs to the farms and properties around the village though he did manage to finance his own house at the age of only  an unusual achievement for a mason in those times jesse had eight children but only one son – cyril h beazer  cyril started working for his father at the age of  but work was scarce and cyril later moved to bath to work for local firms becoming a mason himself and then a general foreman in partnership with a local businessman who owned a small plot of land cyril built two houses and thus began the building business that was to bear the name chbeazer during the s cyril employed no more than a few men and in world war ii was mainly involved in war damage repair work in bath until  when he and his men were directed to undertake similar work in london the early postwar period continued to be dominated by war damage reconstruction in bath but the business gradually extended to new build and to the counties around bath reflecting the increased size of the business c h beazer construction was incorporated in  cyril’s eldest son ralph joined as a director and the younger brother brian became a director in  in the event it was brian beazer who took over as managing director in  and it was he who turned this small bath company into an international construction group the acquisition yearsedit the local firm of mortimer  sons of similar size to ch beazer was bought its general construction business complementing what had become beazer’s predominant private housebuilding in  beazer made a leap from what had been a predominantly southwest firm by developing a commercial property site in brussels within two years it had property developments in belgium france and germany as well as seven schemes in the uk supported by those development profits in july  ch beazer holdings was floated on the london stock exchange barely months before the onset of the first major postwar recession profits fell there were property writedowns and the dividend was cut in  the years that followed were ones of consolidation before the acquisitions began again at the end of the decade – only this time they were on a much larger scale in  beazer bought the somerset firm of rmsmith doubling housing output to around  a year further acquisitions included house builders monsell youell and second city properties the property developer mp kent brick manufacturer westbrick and prefabricated classroom manufacturer prattens by  beazer had become a volume housebuilder with output of over  a year this was doubled the following year with the purchase of william leech taking beazer to number four in the industry also in  beazer made its first foray into the usa with the purchase of cohn communities a small housebuilder a failed attempt to buy the uk’s largest scaffolding company was followed by the hotly contested purchase of french kier a large domestic and international contractor this was complemented by the acquisition of contracting businesses in hong kong and australia but all this was to be overshadowed by beazer’s next steps in the usa in  beazer bought the dallasbased gifford hill the fourth largest cement producer in the usa for £m this was quickly followed by the purchase of koppers for  billion cash koppers was the second largest aggregates business in the usa but it also had a longstanding chemical and wood treatment business with what proved to be significant environmental liabilities the beazer group was now financially highly geared and had to face both the world wide property recession and increasing environmental liabilities – the  accounts contained a provision of over m and rising the beazer solution was to float off beazer europe leaving the us operations beazer homes usa as a separate business while the pathfinder prospectus was still being circulated beazer received a rescue bid from hanson plc hanson’s interest was in the building materials part of beazer and it quickly sold the kier construction business in contrast beazer’s housing was held through the recession and a new beazer group now consisting solely of uk housebuilding still the fourth largest in the uk was floated in  this beazer mark  made its own modest acquisitions and by the end of the s it was producing around  houses a year at the end of  beazer group and bryant homes proposed a “merger of equals” but this was overtaken by a bid for bryant from taylor woodrow this left beazer exposed and in  it was
