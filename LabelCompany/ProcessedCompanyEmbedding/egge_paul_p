after a short break egge machine company made a triumphant return to the sema showernie silvers ceo with dave mcclelland at sema dave was a nhra announcer from  to  and is the voice of our hold message              electric cars are not new—so now what can you imagine how blacksmiths reacted to the “horseless carriage” at the turn of the century  i’m sure some saw the “new fangled” things as just a passing fancy and thought they would never replace the horse for transportation—so why worry  some probably saw the horseless carriage as the wave of the future and began looking for ways to adapt their business  and there were obviously those who decided the trend to horseless carriages was real but there would always be a need for blacksmiths and kept doing business as usual here we are at a similar point in time a hundred years later  for years we have heard predictions that the internal combustion engine ice was doomed and would be replaced  the recent past has seen great strides in improving the ice making it more efficient less polluting and more powerful  most recently we’ve seen various types of ices combined with electric motors to form hybrid vehicles  now like the blacksmiths of a hundred years ago we are faced with a decision  if the trend toward electric vehicles is real how will we respond  the evidence is mounting that ready or not electric cars are poised to make a comeback  that’s correct a comeback  early in the history of the car industry electric cars were outselling gasoline powered carsin the late s electric cars outsold gasoline cars ten to one as a result electric cars dominated the roads and dealer showrooms in fact the first car dealerships were exclusively for electric cars  some automobile companies like oldsmobile and studebaker actually started out as successful manufacturers of electric cars only later did they transition to gasolinepowered vehicles  did you know that          an electric car won the world’s first dirt track race in           an electric car took the world land speed record in           the first vehicle ever to go  mph was an electric car          the first car to ever receive a speeding ticket was an electric car early production electric cars were all hand assembled in  volume production of gasoline powered cars was achieved with the motorized assembly line this breakthrough manufacturing process killed off all but the most wellfinanced car builders independents unable to buy components in volume died off on top of that the infrastructure for electricity was almost nonexistent outside of city boundaries – limiting electric cars to travel within their home city another contributing factor to the decline of electric cars was the addition of an electric motor called the starter to gasoline powered cars – finally removing the need for the difficult and dangerous crank to start the engine due to these factors by the end of world war i production of electric cars stopped and they became niche vehicles – serving as taxis trucks delivery vans and freight handlersin  there were  electric cars were registered in the us  more than  companies offered well over  models  by  there were no electric vehicles displayed in the new york auto show and only  models remained on the market milburn rauch  lang and detroit electricin the late s and early s there was a rebirth of interest in electric cars prompted by concerns about air pollution and the opec oil embargo later in the early s a few major automakers resumed production of electric cars those electric cars were produced in very low volumes—essentially handbuilt like their early predecessors today there are more than  models offered by more than  makes  these electric cars range from basic transportation to luxury status promoting machines the horse still has its enthusiasts the internal combustion engine will probably be around for a good while yet—so will you change your business model to take advantage of the electric car trend news item january  classic car market hagerty insurance has announced the creation of the hagerty market rating a new tool to gauge the status of the classic car market hagerty publishes the hagerty price guide and also developed and maintains hagerty valuation tools the countrys leading online classic car valuation tool the hagerty market rating is a numerical rating that reports the status of the classic car market by applying a weighted algorithm to fifteen data points in eight categories this results in a proprietary data set that includes the volume and directional momentum of public auction and private sale activity insured values price guide values the hagerty indexes and expert sentiment the january  rating is  which indicates an overall expanding and healthy market the rating will be updated on a monthly basis the key differentiator is that the hagerty market rating isnt based simply on public data like auction sales which only make up three percent of the annual transactions in the classic car world said mckeel hagerty ceo of hagerty a large component of this rating is based on privateownertoprivateowner sales which is the most elusive and difficult data to obtain we developed this as a tool to allow anyone who is serious about treating collector cars as investments to immediately take the temperature of the classic car market and truly understand the factors that cause the classic car market to move up or down the hagerty market rating uses a  scale based on a traditional bell curve ratings at or near zero or  while theoretically possible are not likely ratings in the  range indicate a flat or relatively inactive market while below  is a deflationary market becoming more strongly deflationary the closer it is to zero ratings in the  range indicate a peak performing market and above  indicates a market that is approaching a state of hyperdemand marked by rapidly increasing prices and volume that could indicate of a bubble market in the making despite a scottsdale auction season that saw sales increase  over  the overall market is actually in a very healthy place right now mckeel hagerty said yes some segments are overheated and some have recently cooled however on the whole the current market rating is a healthy expanding market through january based on auction sales the classic car market in the us for  was

the ford design was simpler than its predecessors without giving up power making it less expensive to massproduce ultimately much like the model t it changed the automotive industry ford introduced the  cid v engine in  the move was made to provide a more powerful engine for the newly introduced mercury cars collectively all  engines are referred to as  horse engines even though the horsepower started out at  and was increased in  to  horsepower in cars and  horsepower in trucks this engine was used in fords transit buses during their short stint in the transit bus business from the late s to the early sfrom  to  ford did not produce any civilian vehicles but concentrated on production for the war effort after the war for  years    ford used the same engine in both the ford and mercury models then in  the mercury engine was stroked to  inches resulting in  cid ford models continued with the same  cid engine until  when it was changed to a y block in  the bellhousing changed to a completely removable unit the cylinder heads were changed moving the water outlets to the front of the engine the method of attaching the heads to the block also changed going from studs and nuts to

twodoor hardtop conventional sedan and conventional coupe and they all did well however its the sports coupe that people rememberstarting with fords flathead v the engine was stroked so that it cranked out  horsepower for the sport coupe which was about as much as youll get from any vehicle whose v engine only runs with roughly a toone compression ratio at the time it could be mated to a threespeed manual or an automatic and dual downdraft holley carburetorsthe  mercury as typified by the sports coupe was a very modernlooking car for that era rounded the front end featured a minimal amount of chrome the rounded hood worked nicely with the bulbous and rounded front fenders to give the front end a nicely completed smooth look that flowed into a rounded body that carried the lines of the finders through the sloping rear quarters the rounded hood also flowed into the body panels and windshield and the slightly sloped windshield carried the line to the roof which sloped sharply back to a small rounded trunk lid the body also sported wheelwell covers to complete the lookthe other memorable  merc was the woodie wagon also known as an estate wagon that featured mercurys revamped styling interestingly the woodie featured a distinct set of front fenders that were low on the vehicle and above which the rather noticeable hood was visible the woodie did sport its own rather stylish road lampturn signals that were nicely integrated into the single round headlights that were fared into the fenders the fenders on this and other lines that features similar styling

offers a complete engine rebuilding kit consisting of the following items the great race one hundred and two years ago this month the longest car race in history began in new yorks times square it began on february   and was witnessed by an estimated crowd of more than  it was billed as a race around the world and expected to cover  miles from start to finish keep in mind there were extremely few paved roads at that timethe great race was sponsored by the new york times and la matin a french newspaper based in paris and therefore was planned to finish outside the offices of la matin the route began as a line drawn on a globe with major stops in albany ny chicago seattle valdez alaska japan the russian cities of vladivostok omsk moscow and st peterburg then berlin and finally paristhe plan was to send the cars from chicago to san francisco from there by steamer to valdez alaska they would drive from there to the yukon river to be sure of ice on the river the race had to be in winter though no car then had been driven across the us in winter and only seven in the summer the start from new york vas set for february   there were six entrants in the race the competitors represented most of the world superpowers of the day germany italy france and the united states there was much at stake and the eyes of the world would focus on the racers daily with front page newspaper news the race would become an epic test of machines as well as human endurance and ingenuity in a world that for most had never seen a carfor germany the car chosen was a protos for italy the car was a zust there were  cars representing france de dionbouton motobloc and sizairnaudin and a thomas flyer for the us all but the sizairnaudin were cylinder powered and all were right hand drivethe german team turned to the small berlinbased german company of protos after benz and daimler politely bowed out amazingly they designed a custom built car in only  days the protos racing car was an impressive  feet long  feet wide and when loaded with three men an extensive spare parts kit food and  gallons of gas weighed some three tons the car was powered by a hp engine that made it possible for the car to reach speeds of up to mph there was no enclosed passenger cabin and the trip across the united states and siberia would be under cover of nothing more than canvas the protos was roughly the same size as a modern chevrolet suburban built with steamera technology the french fielded  teams the first chose a dedion for its car the dedion model  came with a cyclinder engine speed transmission and had a top speed of  mph the second team chose a motobloc the motobloc was noted for an innovative engine design which combined the engine clutch and gearbox in a single main casingthe motobloc was powered by a monobloc engine which had cylinders that were not individual but cast as a single unit seems normal today but was quite an innovation back then the engine was inclined at  degrees from the horizontal and the gearbox was made as part of the same unit with the crankcase it also had a fly wheel mounted in the center of the crankshaft this in turn was mounted on four main bearings which significantly reduced engine vibration  the engine had overhead inlet valves and side exhaust with hemispherical combustion chambers lubrication was by an oil pump and cooling by a water pump this combined assembly was mounted transversely in the chassis and drove the rear axle by chainthe third french team chose a sizairenaudin for their car a much smaller car than the rest of the competitors it was a twoseater powered by a cylinder engine the car had an independent front suspension and combined with the  hp engine won a number of early racesthe italian team chose a zust for their car the zust model  had a cc cyclinder engine speed transmission and had a top speed of  mphthe us team drove a thomas flyer model  it had a cyclinder engine speed transmission weighed  pounds and had a top speed of  mphthe zust led at first then the thomas these and the de dion made the  miles to hudson through snow drifts and stopped for the night the protos was at poughkeepsie mishaps stopped the motobloc at peekskill it never caught up and eventually dropped out of the racethe sizairenaudin dropped out of the race two hours after the start the rear axle of the little car collapsed climbing spitlock hill and replacement parts didnt workthe thomas increased its lead in the mud of iowa and it was at carroll iowa that the motobloc finally quit the raceat san francisco after repairs the thomas flyer was shipped by steamer to seattle then in a second steamer to valdez alaska there snowdrifts as high as houses prevented it being driven off the dock and it was shipped back to seattleback in seattle the us team learned that the race was to be resumed in vladivostok that the zust and de dion which followed them into san francisco were already enroute to russia by way of japan that the protos which had been shipped by rail to seattle from its last breakdown near pocatello idaho was being sent direct to vladivostok the us team chose to go by way of japan at this point the race committee gave the thomas flyer a day advantage for going to alaska and penalized the protos  days for not driving to san franciscoas all four cars reached vladivostok three of them after  tortuous miles across japan the marquise de dion maker of the de dion car withdrew it from the race that left half of the original entrants in the racezust protos and the thomas flyerthe protos was the first car to cross the finish line but its team was penalized  days for using railroad transport to meet a critical north american deadline meeting the other surviving racers to catch a ship to russia that combined with the  day advantage given to the thomas flyer brought the protos in second the thomas flyer crossed the finish line on june th  days and  miles from the start in new york the zust reached paris on september th and took third placein early  the trophy for the new york to paris race was awarded to the thomas flyer team in new york it is over  feet high and weighs in excess of  pounds the base is a combination of green italian and pink french marble there are medallions of german bronze depicting the coats of arms of the competing countries and the trophy is topped by an american eagle it is now in the national automobile museum in reno nevada with the thomas flyer as restored by william harrah the protos was restored by the siemens family and is in the deutsches museum in munich the zust is on vancouver island as part of a collection assembled by buck rogers therefore the only finishers of the longest automobile race ever sanctioned all still existin  as part of the great american race from disneyland to boston the thomas flyer was put on the road again ginni and newt withers were entering the record holding car in the cross country event sponsored by interstate batteries in preparation the engine was rebuilt and egge machine was commissioned to cast new pistons for the car the  inch pistons were some of the largest ever cast by egge up to that time april   july   a race combining the future with the past plans are now being made for world race  to commemorate the  epic and make history of its own with a start in new york city participants will circle the globe with their automobiles to the finish line in paris for the unfolding story visit  world race blog the collector car market is alive and well the last couple of
