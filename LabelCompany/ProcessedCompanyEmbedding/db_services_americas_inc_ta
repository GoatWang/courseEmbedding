updates by jeremiah hammond  posted may    in development filemaker inproduct updateshttpsdbservicescomwpcontentuploadsdblogositeretinapngdb serviceshttpsdbservicescomwpcontentuploadsfilemakerinproductupdateslogojpgpxpx  filemaker inproduct updates filemaker  introduced a much welcomed improvement to the updating process you can now upgrade your filemaker pro directly in pro itself instead of needing to hunt for an updater on a separate web page but that’s not all – the updaters are significantly smaller in size making downloads faster with these changes filemaker has modernized the updating process which should ultimately result in more users on the latest version a goal that aligns with fmi’s continued focus on security how it works if there’s a new minor version available you will be asked when you open filemaker pro if you’d like to install the update you can elect to either install it be reminded later or skip the version entirely unlike the previous versions of pro where you would be taken to the updates web page the new version will be downloaded all within pro itself once downloaded you will be prompted to install the update and relaunch pro doing so will complete the update process by replacing the current version of pro with the new one some odds and ends inproduct updates are only available on pro server updates will still require going to the updates page you can check for a new version at any time via help–check for updates just like you could in previous versions you can turn off new version alerts the same way you could in previous versions via unchecking the “notify me when an update is available” option under preferences inproduct updates only apply to minor versions eg v to v major versions eg  to  will still require downloading and running an installer outside of pro conclusion like all great features inproduct updates will become so natural so quickly that people will assume upgrading always worked this way and now that the process is nearly effortless for users i hope to see more frequent releases from fmi as the popular software development saying goes release early and release often do you need help upgrading your filemaker system to the latest version contact us to discuss upgrading your filemaker application today jeremiah hammond jeremiah is a certified filemaker

testimonials we needed a new system and we risked losing some of our biggest clients if we couldnt get our new database running within days db services immediately came to the rescue and managed the project that provided us the entire custom database in only  days this achievement made an immediate positive impact to our business steve horst managing partner universal marketing group “we have worked with db services since  and have been extremely pleased they currently manage  vertical software products for new image and excel in understanding our needs and the needs of our clients database development services is a strategic partner in the growth and success of our business” rich jordan president new image software inc “thank you for our new database system we transitioned from a carbon copy paper based system to a digital database the software has saved us time and money we used to archive all our jobs in cabinets now we can look up a job in seconds from anywhere the software allows us to easily email estimates to our customers in pdf format in a year there was a return on investment just from eliminating the purchasing of our carbon forms” todd cartmel owner the painting edge “we needed a solution that would simplify the administration of our responsibilities under our contract with the state of indiana we have seen a dramatic increase across the state in the number of potential foster and adoptive parents that have begun the preparation and training process this increase has resulted in a significant opportunity for children available for adoption that’s a big win for everyone and it’s all because we can refer potential parents to the proper state contacts efficiently and quickly chris morrison executive director indiana foster care  adoption association “the new system allows us to create and track jobs for customers along with inventory something we had been doing with separate word and spreadsheet files because it’s now so intuitive new staff members are able to begin using the database immediately without our usual training session and ‘cheat sheets’ for getting around within the file” tom andrews president turning star inc “we were actually able to add more features than we thought would be possible within our budget we always experienced a ‘can do’ attitude and db services was incredibly patient and easy to work with” courtney hartman art director drake university “thank you for all of your expertise and valuable help i am so grateful to have found db services” linda findlay owner mourning discoveries “the new filemaker custom website interface is very userfriendly and easy to follow for our clients in addition it is much faster than the old instant web publishing iwp interface thank you and all the others who have helped us out at db services i am very grateful for the excellent service you provide us its nice to know we can call you for help if we have an issue” wayne capek president floodplain consultants
