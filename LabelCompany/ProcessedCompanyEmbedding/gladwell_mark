targets worldwide he successfully reproduced milgrams results the average length of the chain was approximately six links however when he examined the pathways taken he found that hubs highly connected people were not crucial only  of the email messages had passed through one of the hubs this casts doubt on gladwells assertion that specific types of people are responsible for bringing about large levels of change watts pointed out that if it were as simple as finding the individuals that can disseminate information prior to a marketing campaign advertising agencies would presumably have a far higher success rate than they do he also stated that gladwells theory does not square with much of his research into human social dynamics performed in the last ten years economist steven levitt and gladwell have a running dispute about whether the fall in new york citys crime rate can be attributed to the actions of the police department and fixing broken windows as claimed in the tipping point in freakonomics levitt attributes the decrease in crime to two primary factors  a drastic increase in the number of police officers trained and deployed on the streets and hiring raymond w kelly as police commissioner thanks to the efforts of former mayor david dinkins and  a decrease in the number of unwanted children made possible by roe v wade causing crime to drop nationally in all major cities—even in los angeles a city notorious for bad policing however psychologist steven pinker has suggested the second factor relies on tenuous links see alsoedit tipping point sociology

businesses i love words i love writing i love life i’m secretly obsessed with internet marketingfeb   quotes from malcolm gladwell’s ‘the tipping point’ that you need to go viralwhat makes certain things fly and others stay stagnant it’s a formula of luck precision and finding something that people can’t get enough ofmalcolm gladwell is an iconic figure in the social sciences for figuring out what makes people move in a certain direction or gravitate towards certain products it’s something that social media marketers spend their lives trying to figure out what do you need to do to get noticed the tipping point was gladwell’s first successful book which he adapted from an article he wrote about the drop in crime in new york city and the social movements that made it happengladwell knew something that all social media marketers would need to know just a few years later he saw what made people attracted to ideas and products gladwell saw the nature of what makes things go viral he broke everything down into a few specific principles that help us understand how ideas move take a look at this breakdown and think of how you might use these same thoughts in your daytoday marketing dutiesthe “law of the few”gladwell defines this “law” like this “the success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts” businesses now call these “few” “influencers” on social media if you have an instagram account with hundreds of thousands of followers you could make some serious cash by representing a brand these social media users have many followers and their followers like what they post and share it businesses use these influencers to build brand awareness it’s a simple yet genius marketing tool it’s the same reason we place “share” buttons on blogs and request people to subscribe to our blogs finding that right person can allow for anything unknown to become known in just a matter of timethe “stickiness factor”this principle involves to what extent a product or idea “sticks” in the mind of a viewer or consumer gladwell discusses many concepts that just “stuck” better than others due to the principles that made them undeniably attractive to audiences finding that niche in which makes you stand out from everyone else is crucial be it a product or a blog every post should have some sort of a take home message that will hopefully stick with readers and keep them coming back for more of what you’re offeringthe “power of context”this is an important principle for content creators especially this concept claims that people are sensitive to their environment and the situations happening within it this is the reason why current events make such great headlines when big things are happening in the world people relate to holidays events news making headlines and the things that everyone is talking about as content creators we give people the surge to continue talking about the things that everyone is talking about just from a new anglebelow you’ll find some of the best quotes from the tipping point that can help us all become better content creators and ultimately better internet marketers“there is a simple way to package information that under the right circumstances can make it irresistible all you have to do is find it” malcolm gladwellwhat makes certain things fly and others stay stagnant it’s a formula of luck precision and finding something that people can’t get enough of it’s why starbucks is like a drug our iphones are like drugs we get a certain defined benefit from using these products even if only for a moment our iphones make us feel incredibly productive at every waking hour even if we’ve resorted to playing a game drinking starbucks makes us feel sophisticated and energized these brands have built these ideas specifically into our heads over time without us ever realizing it as content writers we can do the same things by building a blog as a goto piece of information if we look to bigger brands as examples we can see that this development won’t happen overnight our blogs need to add value and make people feel that they are getting a benefit out of every single post “look at the world around you it may seem like an immovable implacable place it is not with the slightest push — in just the right place — it can be tipped” — malcolm gladwellthe key to this statement is “the right place” while every product and idea isn’t going to take over the world the key is to take over your own corner of the world it’s important to define what type of audience you’re looking for before you begin writing any content the best place to start is not by looking at where others have succeeded but thinking about where your exact audience is lurking write about what you know your audience will be interested in we’re all over keyword stuffed pages that lack depth we’re over catchy headlines with content below them that tell us nothing “tip” your readers by drawing them in with interest and substance “the idea that epidemics can rise or fall in one dramatic moment — is the most important because it is the principle that… permits the greatest insight into why modern change happens the way it does” — malcolm gladwellwith the yoyo craze of the ’s companies made their money with an epidemic of kids who wanted to play with yoyos and be cool the phenomenon didn’t stick because there was nothing more to it and no one managed to capitalize on it there was no “next” when it came to the yoyo in a technological erain the modern day many people believe that facebook will die and some new social trend will come around the truth is if facebook continues its current trend the company will continue to evolve mark zuckerberg is constantly looking for the next big thing with a focus and direction as content writers we all need to be constantly on the lookout for “the next big thing” it’s why my email inbox is never completely devoid of unread emails truly as a content writer you’re stuck in school forever because you’re constantly learning we must always keep our eyes and ears open to the big picture of a business subject or industry “when it comes to epidemics though this disproportionality becomes even more extreme a tiny percentage of people do the majority of the work” malcolm gladwellwhen people have an idea they usually picture it being a mass success before they picture getting the product or content in our case in front of the right people if we look at the massive success of ellen degeneres we can see this principle at work clear as day degeneres didn’t become a successful talk show host because networks thought that absolutely everyone would want to watch her in fact networks rejected her because they didn’t immediately see what she had in common with the audience they were aiming for just like influencers in social media reaching the right few people can lead to the right type of epidemic if content reaches the right subset of an audience it will ultimately become its own epidemic “to create one contagious movement you often have to create many small movements first”the first piece of content is most likely not going to be the content that has the potential to go viral whether you’re writing content for yourself or for a business it’s key to remember to let your audience get to know you this is how an audience is built over time once one piece of content becomes known the previous ones that were written will gain a reputation as well piece by piece is how a seemingly viral movement is actually built you’ll often hear superstar investor mark cuban say to entrepreneurs on the abc hit show shark tank “it’s not a company it’s a product” this usually just means that the billionaire has no interest in investing in the product all companies started with one product and if there’s interest in it the “sharks” will invest in it and run with it without the first product nothing can become a success in its own entityfind your “tipping point”in a day and age where content overload is rampant it’s a wonder anything gets noticed anymore the list of steps for something to go viral or become wellknown seems to get longer malcolm gladwell’s points allow marketers and content writers alike to see the world in a more simplistic way creating content that carries itself may not have a specific formula yet his points hold true in just about every area of internet marketing and content creation that we work with as entrepreneurs and writers finding that ultimate balance that makes our own little worlds “tip” can be done by looking at the principles gladwell lays out while much of the generally accepted daytoday marketing techniques we use are at the core of the discussion in the tipping point it’s interesting to look at these ideas coming from a very different world since the tipping point was written before our lives were truly inundated with technology we can look at gladwell’s work as a prophecy of what was to come and something to be built uponall images from pablo by buffer via splashsharenever miss a story from marketing and
