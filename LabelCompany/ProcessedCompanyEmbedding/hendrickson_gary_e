corporate website at valsparcom also please note that our reported results this morning include nongaap financial measures these results should not be confused with the gaap numbers in todays earnings release or with the gaap numbers we will report in our form q for gaap to nongaap reconciliations please refer to the supplemental schedules in this mornings news release with that ill turn the call over to gary gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today ill provide highlights of our first quarter performance and discuss our outlook for the rest of the year the results in our first quarter finished in line with our expectations as we discussed on our q call we expected that the unique combination of several factors would present challenges in the first quarter ill let jim remind you of those details later but looking beyond these items q was a good quarter in terms of new business growth across our portfolio we also continued to execute on our productivity plans which helped contribute to improved gross margins in the quarter the key takeaway is that the first quarter results were in line with our plan and we continue to expect growth in the balance of the year so lets look at a few highlights from coatings and paints in the quarter our coatings segment continues to perform well we saw a modest decline in volume and sales driven by tough comparisons to last year when volume was up  we increased our net new business ebit grew  and we improved our ebit margins by  basis points in the quarter looking at the coatings product lines individually packaging volume was up low single digits for the quarter on top of midsingle digit growth last year highlighting the quarter was continued strong growth in asia and further growth in nonbpa coatings in both north america and europe we expect nonbpa conversions to continue in north america and europe and as the industry leader we believe we are best positioned to take advantage of this dynamic our coil product line volume was up midsingle digits in q driven by significant new business wins in north america latin america and europe this performance follows many quarters of growth in coil we continue to leverage our technology and service platform to strengthen our leading market share position globally we further enhanced this position last week through the acquisition of isva vernici a european coil coatings manufacturer headquartered in italy this acquisition extends valspars sales and manufacturing capabilities in the  billion european coil market volume in our general industrial product line was challenged by difficult comparisons to last year and certain end market headwinds new business gains in asia and latin america were more than offset by market declines in the container and the ag and construction markets in our wood product line volume increased mid singledigits in north america driven by new business wins volumes were down in asia as we were up against  growth in q last year you may recall that last year customers accelerated orders in q ahead of a new tax on solventbased products in china that was introduced in q last year overall our coatings businesses are positioned very well as we continue to leverage our diversified product portfolio technology leadership and strong pipeline of new business to improve growth and profitability ill turn now to our paints segment starting first with north america consumer paints continuing the momentum of last year sellthrough of valspar products was up high singledigits in north america as expected overall volume declined reflecting the impact of the change at lowes and in addition volumes were impacted by customer reductions to inventory levels looking forward we expect customer inventories to be more balanced with sellthrough as we move into the paint season as a reminder exiting the first quarter we have now substantially anniversaried the change at lowes which will ease our comparisons in the balance of the year last quarter we mentioned that we were net winners in recent line reviews with our retail partners id like to highlight some of those new wins we have several new initiatives with lowes that will be ready for this years paint season these include the launch of cabot stain products supported by a full product range at lowes were also refreshing our merchandizing display space at lowes which includes the addition of  more display space at the home depot after last years successful test were rolling out an expanded lineup of cabot stain for this season and at bq our brand continues to gain momentum were now partnering to expand our product range into several new categories with expanded shelf space in the store so wrapping up on the paints segment consumer paints product line volumes in europe were up double digits volumes in china and australia were down in the quarter as we were up against strong doubledigit comps from last year and in our auto refinish product line volume more than doubled in the quarter this was driven by the impact of the quest acquisition and from growth in our legacy refinish business as we exit q our view of the fiscal year has not changed in total we do not expect much help from the overall economy instead we continue to focus on what we can control our own execution winning new business and continuing to be more productive in everything we do based on our outlook we have reiterated our guidance for fiscal  and with that ill turn it over to jim jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer good morning everyone gary has covered the key business highlights for the quarter so ill focus my comments this morning on our first quarter financial performance and outlook for fiscal  as gary mentioned q results finished in line with our expectations on last quarters call we highlighted that the first quarter would be our most challenging period of the year from a growth perspective as a result we expected sales and earnings to be down in the quarter the anticipated decline in q was embedded in our annual outlook and was the result of the factors we detailed during our q call including the impact of unfavorable currency translation which lowered q sales by approximately  or  million and the eps by  in the quarter second the continued impact from the change at lowes which we have now substantially annualized third our q results were up against exceptional performance in our coatings segment last year when volumes grew  and ebit increased  and finally interest expense in q increased  million yearoveryear reflecting the impact of our bond issuances in  we plan for these items and they explain the bulk of the decline in sales and earnings for the first quarter going forward these items will have much less of an impact on our growth as we progress through the year with this as context lets move on to discuss the balance of our results in the quarter ill start with volume and sales total volume declined  and sales were down  acquisitions added  to volume and  to sales in the quarter total sales declined approximately  in constant currency looking at the top line performance of our two segments in q coatings segment volumes were down  and sales declined  in constant currency these results were solid considering we were up against strong performance last year when coatings volumes increased doubledigit volume growth in coatings was led by the coil and packaging product lines this growth was offset by declines in general industrial and asia wood where we are up against very strong performance last year and end market softness in container and ag equipment products moving to the paints segment q volumes were down  and sales declined  in constant currency the addition of quest increased paints segment volume and sales by  and  respectively during the quarter the volume decline in paints was primarily driven by the change at lowes and customer actions to lower inventory as gary referenced earlier in addition we were up against challenging comparisons to the doubledigit volume growth in asia and australia in the first quarter of last year wrapping up the paints segment volumes in europe at bq increased doubledigits and auto refinish volumes were up reflecting the addition of quest and growth in our legacy business moving on to overall gross margin we finished the quarter with adjusted gross margin of  up  basis points the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by ongoing productivity programs cost price and benefits from improved sales mix looking at expenses in q operating expense dollars were up slightly the addition of quest was partially offset by the impact of fx given the reduction in sales adjusted opex as a percent of sales increased in the quarter to  bringing it all together consolidated adjusted ebit declined  and ebit margin finished at  down  basis points in the coatings segment adjusted first quarter ebit of  million was up  and increased  basis points the increase in ebit was primarily driven by the benefits from productivity initiatives and cost price which more than offset the decline in sales and the impact of currency translation paints segment adjusted ebit of  million and ebit margin of  declined from the prior year this decrease was the result of lower volumes and the impact of foreign currency translation these items were partially offset by positive benefits from productivity initiatives cost price and the quest acquisition we expect to see improved ebit growth in paints in the balance of the year as the yearoveryear comparisons ease moving on to a couple of other items in the quarter cash flow from operations was approximately  million for the first quarter up more than  million compared to the first quarter last year our q adjusted tax rate of  improved  basis points driven primarily by foreign tax credits and lower foreign tax rates we continue to expect the annual tax rate will be between  and  for fiscal  wrapping up the highlights for the quarter we paid  million of dividends representing a per share increase of  and repurchased  shares of our company stock for a total investment of  million moving on to the outlook for the balance of fiscal  we expect the annual sales growth to be up mid singledigits in constant currency or up slightly on a reported basis including the estimated impact of fx we expect fiscal  adjusted eps in the range of  to  which is unchanged from our previous outlook with that wed like to open up the call for your questions questionandanswer session operator we will go to line of ivan marcuse with keybanc please go ahead ivan m marcuse  keybanc capital markets inc hi thanks for taking my questions the first one is on your coating business you continue to see some nice improvement in the yearoveryear margins how much would you if you gauge is raw materials versus the productivity that you called out and if its mostly productivity do you expect to see a sort of the same yearoveryear improvement as we move through the year jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah ivan good morning its jim a large portion of the benefit that we saw in the quarter in coatings was the productivity initiatives that we did last year so as we move into the balance of the year as we noted on last quarters call were going to start to anniversary some of those more in earnest as we get into q q and beyond so we expect that yearoveryear improvement to diminish the other side of the equation is certainly given the tough compares we had in the coatings segment this quarter those compares ease as we move forward so we expect better volumes in the balance of the year but the growth in margin rate will be less in the coatings segment for the balance of the year as well ivan m marcuse  keybanc capital markets inc in terms of the new business that you called out in the coatings is that enough with your view of the macro environment to see – start seeing growth as we move through the year on a volume basis yearoveryear gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yes yes it is ivan were expecting – every one of the business – of our coatings product lines is expecting growth for the full year ivan m marcuse  keybanc capital markets inc great and then just one quick question in terms of the destocking that you called out in paints how much did that impact your pl if you can quantify that and should we see the reverse happen in the second quarter as the new business that you called out starts to roll through and be filled into the channel gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah let me just – ill give you the crib notes version on the quarter ivan since youve asked a question both on coatings and paints so coatings came in right where we expected maybe a little bit better paints came in a little bit below where we expected and that was basically  attributed to inventory – lower inventory in north america than we had in the previous year i wouldnt read much into that at all q is our lowest quarter for sales small movements in inventory levels can have a disproportionate impact it wasnt a lot of money it was a few tensofmillionsofdollars our sellthrough in paints in north america was very solid again this quarter and we fully expect that our channel partners are going to refresh inventory to match sellthrough as we go through the rest of the year operator thank you our next question goes to the line of bob koort with goldman sachs please go ahead robert andrew koort  goldman sachs  co yeah hi gary just to followup on that can you quantify what that sellthrough was in north america gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer we did – yeah sorry bob we did in my remarks that we – across the channels in north america sellthrough of valspar was up high single digits robert andrew koort  goldman sachs  co okay thanks unfortunately i got on late and then can you talk a little bit about any expectations you have in the australian market with the change in ownership at masters does that affect you at all or has that become a small enough part of the portfolio at wattyl that you wont really see a big impact gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean on a total company basis bob its de minimis for the australia consumer business it was about  million of sales last year so – also the de minimis impact given what we can do in terms of restructuring to deal with the smallish loss so no impact in australia thats of significance absolutely no impact to the corporation and lets see what happens i mean its not – i dont believe that a decision has been made to shutter the doors on masters were still supporting them were still selling them paint and were in a waitandsee mode like everyone else is robert andrew koort  goldman sachs  co and is there any product line reviews possible in canada when lowes acquires one of the leading home supply companies up there where i dont think you have much exposure today is that something that could be on the horizon gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer maybe bob but way too early to tell and to my knowledge we havent had any conversations about that yet robert andrew koort  goldman sachs  co and then just real briefly the initiatives youve had with lowes pro ace and bq couple of years into that from when you first announced them wondering if you can just give us a letter grade for the execution and results across those three platforms as you look back now gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think all three are more or less where we expected them to be i mean i called out specifically bq in my remarks that apparently you didnt hear because you joined a little bit late but bq is going great weve extended our product line into some new categories weve got additional shelf space in the store we called that out as about a  million opportunity for us we believe that the run rate coming out of this year is going to be about  million ace is on track the key dimension of the ace program that we talked about last year that we needed to improve was the penetration of the valspar brand into the overall mix of paint thats sold in ace stores thats improving thats been on a good trend and were about  basis points higher in that penetration today than we were at this time last year and lowes pro i dont want to talk specifically about that anymore because the dynamics have changed there a little bit with the new entrant into the store but were very satisfied and pleased with the performance of our pro program with lowes robert andrew koort  goldman sachs  co great thanks for the help gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer youre welcome operator thank you next we will go to the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank please go ahead david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc thank you good morning gary in coatings would you expect volume growth to remain negative for q and q at least gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer no no we expect it to turn positive for the remainder of the year dave david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc and in coatings in earnings in q should that be up at a similar rate we saw in q as well gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah were not going to – weve historically and well continue not to talk about quarters specifically but jim did mention earlier david that some of the margin expansion that weve seen in coatings – a good deal of it was related to productivity programs that we had last year that start to cycle off as we move through the remainder of the year so were not going to see the types of increases that we saw in q as we move through the rest of the year david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc thank you very much gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer youre welcome operator thank you next we will go to the line of ghansham panjabi with robert w baird please go ahead ghansham panjabi  robert w baird  co inc broker hey guys good morning back to the question on the paints sellthrough of highsingle digits in north america gary can you just give us some more color on that what price points in particular drove that and where are you in terms of the own inventories just given that your comments on how your customers are managing inventories gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah ghansham im not going to get specific because i think its sensitive information whether its for our retail partners and for us as to what particular products are selling well but just say that the valspar branded products as a whole across channels in north america were up highsingle digits and we think thats stronger performance than any of our competitors in our inventories theyre balanced the paint season is a predictable thing for us we know when our retail partners are going to start to order we start to build inventory in anticipation of those orders nothing is different this year with the exception of as i mentioned in my remarks earlier that inventory levels across channels in north america a little bit lower than they were last year ghansham panjabi  robert w baird  co inc broker thats helpful and then just in terms of general industrial you called on midsingle digit declines how does that breakout across your various regions thanks gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah the big one for us is the container coatings market in china which is very weak and the ag and construction market really broadly which is weak as well so thats heavy construction equipment for mining agriculture and construction those are the two weak spots in the general industrial portfolio but as i said today a bit earlier we expect growth in our coatings segment as we move through the year we have the benefit of a very diverse portfolio across many geographies and end markets and we think that were going to be able balance some of that end market cyclicality with growth in other areas operator thank you next our question goes to the line of jeff zekauskas jpmorgan please go ahead jeffrey j zekauskas  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning in the quarter you have this remarkable gross margins but at the same time your absolute level of sga expense was about flat yearoveryear even though your sales declined i dont know  so why were the overhead expenses so unchanged jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah two things jeff and i mentioned a little bit of this in my prepared remarks first is we have the benefit – im sorry we have the addition of quest that we obviously havent anniversaried yet in the business which actually drove sga up as you would expect but that combined with the impact of fx in the quarter remember fx  shows up on the expense line as a benefit and q was the biggest period of fx that was significant for the year so really that change in the sga was offset by reductions due to just the timing – or sorry just due to translation adjustment in fx jeffrey j zekauskas  jpmorgan securities llc okay i guess for my followup there has been some sort of delay or some sort of depletion of inventory is it the case can you talk about what your average prices were in the course of  and how you expect your average prices in  is there some connection between the delay in orders and different pricing trends gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer no no correlation whatsoever jeff jeffrey j zekauskas  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you so much gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer youre welcome jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer thanks jeff operator thank you next we will go to line of pj juvekar with citi please go ahead pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc broker yes good morning couple of questions first on paints you saw  basis points decline in margins despite what should have been a very favorable raw material benefit environment i know you had decline in volumes but maybe you can comment on that and your customer inventory adjustment comment all your competitors that have reported so far nobody has mentioned that so maybe can you just sort of tie that in with your margin decline jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah i sure can pj so to your first question around the rate of decline in ebit margins as you know our first quarter especially in our paints segment is our smallest quarter of the year and given the sga fixed infrastructure of the business changes in the top line are going to dramatically impact the bottom line from a rate ebit rate standpoint and thats what you saw you saw the combination of the fact that we hadnt anniversaried the change in lowes yet you had the impact of fx and then you had the timing adjustment of inventories in north america the combination of all of those on an already small quarter is going to have a disproportionate impact on rates in the quarter similar to the comments that gary provided earlier really on inventory i mean its q were outside of paint season its not unusual for us or others to have small changes at inventory between the quarters key thing for us is that our sellthrough plans for the quarter came in line with expectations outlook for the balance of the year hasnt changed so we know that as time goes on inventories will match sellthrough to keep product availability where it needs to be with our retail partners so youre going to have these timing adjustments once in a while and we look forward to those inventories returning back to more normalized levels as we head towards  pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you and then gary in refinish you acquired quest refinish has been a great business for lot of companies with steady margins what are your longterm aspirations there thank you gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah it was a great business for us before we acquired quest pj and it will be at least twice as good now that we own them we doubled the size of the refinish business that we had from about  million to about  million which in the part of the market that we operate in we feel is adequate scale as we called out in in our prepared comments we grew the business this quarter both the legacy business that we had and then obviously with the addition of quest it was significant growth that acquisition by the way is right on track the things that we plan to do to get synergies are occurring were very very pleased with the team that we acquired with quest its really solid and the people are really solid and complementary to ours so we couldnt be more pleased the longterm goal for that business is as ive said it i think ive said it publicly is we expect that thats a  million business in about four years five years time up from  million last year pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you operator thank you next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital please go ahead arun viswanathan  rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning i was just hoping maybe you could characterize the operating environment in china right now you noted some potential softness there as well as in australia what are you seeing from your customers and what do you expect going forward gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah its really specific to the endmarket arun so our packaging business in china had another quarter of almost  growth part of that is structural growth in the market as the conversion from glass to cans continues and part of it was market share gains for us our consumer business was a little bit weaker than it was last year but that was against extremely strong comparisons in the first quarter of last year same was true with our wood coatings business i called out the fact that we had a  growth in q last year so we didnt expect to have growth this year i mentioned the ag and construction market in china thats pretty weak we were negative in that business this year and the container business is pretty weak so overall i dont like to make comments about the overall market because weve selected markets that we think we have an opportunity to have longterm growth and have the opportunity to win in but i will say for our overall portfolio we expect that were going to have to take market share this year to get to the commitments that weve made to our board and our shareholders so im not expecting a ton of growth from the overall market but we do have some terrific market share opportunities that we expect to capitalize on arun viswanathan  rbc capital markets llc okay and then in north america there has been a year or so of inventory corrections in the big box channel that various competitors have cited im just curious what do you think is going on i mean is there a heightened level of competitive activity is there any difference that you see between that channel and others – i know you dont have exposure anywhere  but maybe you can just give me your overall thoughts on how the big box channel is evolving over the last year or two and what you expect going forward gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer i dont see any significant change yeah so we called out a modest inventory adjustment across channels we werent specific to a big box channel we sell all channels in north america and we were quite specific that it was across multiple channels that we saw a modest inventory correction and as jim said earlier this is – for our quarter which is a very small quarter a modest change in inventory levels can have a disproportionate impact so we felt that we should call it out thats the reason were talking about it arun viswanathan  rbc capital markets llc right gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer as i said to ivan i wouldnt make a big deal of this at all because its not arun viswanathan  rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough thanks gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer thanks arun operator thank you next we will go to the line of nils wallin with clsa please go ahead nilsbertil wallin  clsa americas llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question given your comments around high sellthrough at your customers in north american paints it sounds like youre expecting a destock – excuse me a restocking in the rest of the year so should we begin to see some positive volume growth in your paints business from the rest of the year and is there any reason to expect that restocking not to occur jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah well two things were going to see improved performance in the paints segment first and foremost given the fact that weve anniversaried the change in lowes started in q our plans for the paint season really havent changed you saw our performance in north america last year with sellthrough and were expecting good performance this year as well from a sellthrough standpoint and inventories will balance themselves out to match that what specific quarter it happens in and how thats through well have to see but key thing for us is nothing has changed from our sellthrough expectations in the north american business and its early and well see how paint season goes nilsbertil wallin  clsa americas llc got it and just on packaging volumes up lowsingledigits but sales down lowsingle digits exfx is there some sort of pricing issue or mix going on here or – kind of surprised that you see price declines when youre rolling out – youre still rolling out the bpafree product jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah nils there is a combination of things going on there you correctly point out as we roll into more nonbpa product that has a favorable impact on price but as weve noted historically weve got a nice business with a number of customers globally and our contracts with those customers include pricing escalators and deescalators over time so there is just a natural balancing that goes on within those contracts gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer the other factor nils which has even greater impact in that is the growth is – most of the growth in the quarter came from asia and most of that growth is in beverage which has a much lower price point than our food and general line product line does so jim im not sure that we have the exact breakdown on what all that is but mix had a significant impact as well jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer thats right nilsbertil wallin  clsa americas llc great and just a final one if i may where are you in terms of the tinting penetration at bq gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer were significantly higher than we were at this point last year i dont know the exact number youre going to have to get that from bill later nilsbertil wallin  clsa americas llc got it thanks so much jim l muehlbauer  executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer thanks nils operator thank you next we will go to the line of vincent andrews morgan stanley please go ahead matthew gingrich  morgan stanley  co llc hi this is matt gingrich on for vincent i was curious if you had a sense for how sellthrough in north american paints deferred between interior and exterior product lines gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer well in the first quarter its mostly interior i think because its winter matthew gingrich  morgan stanley  co llc well thats fair but im speaking more on a yearoveryear basis and it was one of the warmest gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer we dont know we dont know matthew gingrich  morgan stanley  co llc okay it was something that you commented on in the past but then to follow up i was wondering if you could speak to the negotiations and dynamics surrounding price and how theyve differed across your various coatings in the markets which subsegment should we expect more resiliency or more pressure on a goforward basis gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer we have conversations with all of our customers on a regular basis about what the correct value proposition is for valspar products and so to get specific on the nature of those conversations wouldnt be helpful i dont think matthew gingrich  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you operator thank you next we will go to the line of dmitry silversteyn with longbow research please go ahead dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc good morning just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions if i can when you look at your markets in china and australia i understand that the weakness in the first quarter had to do with difficult comps but as you sort of take a look whats going on there economically and within your specific endmarkets how do you see those markets performing in  gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i answered this question in a way thats maybe not as specific as you want dmitry because we cant predict i mean we understand that the china market is not as strong as it was two years ago maybe even last year generally speaking but we still have a small position in an extremely large market and we have good programs that should enable us to take market share so when we put our plan together for the full year this year we are quite specific internally and externally that we werent expecting a lot of help from the macro and that we expected wed have to generate our own growth this year so thats the way our plans are put together if youre trying to develop or reference about how to evaluate valspars performance for the full year think about it that way dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc okay gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer and in australia i think the market is not materially different – the paint market is not materially different than it was last year dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc okay so no incremental weakness or recovery in the housing market that would impact how youre growing in that region one way of the other gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer thats the way were planning our year thats right dmitry dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc okay with respect to bq you talk about having doubledigit growth there in your second sort of full year in that distribution channel in terms of your sort of future opportunities with kingfisher what do you have to show in bq for this program to be deemed successful by your partner and perhaps position you to take the next up in expanding your position in europe gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah thats a good question and one that im not prepared to answer in depth but i will say that both we and bq are extremely pleased with the progress that weve made and we thus far believes that this is a replicatable program through other parts of the kingfisher organization and ill just say that i think if we continue to execute well well given the opportunity dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc okay fair enough gary and then one small question on ma both in terms of sort of your focus going forward as far as either geographic or in more particular product type or end markets that youre looking to penetrate and also if you can comment on this recent deal announced between the akzo and basfs industrial coatings business whether or not that changes the market dynamics in europe that can either help you or hold you back from gaining share and growing that business in europe especially since isva  acquisition gave you a much better footprint there gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah weve actually done two things in europe to enhance our position we acquired – it was a small acquisition of a manufacturing facility that was doing tool manufacturing for us in coil coatings and had a small business to support our coil coatings business in finland a few months ago not material so not reported and then we just did the isva acquisition our coils business in europe has been performing extraordinarily well and so we are out of capacity which is the reason that we acquired the manufacturing asset and we have commitments hard commitments of significant new business from very large customers in the european market that are fully baked into our plans for this year i think therell be some incremental upside even from as recently as post close of the isva acquisition for some incremental business with some of their customers who are pleased that that business is owned by a multinational so were very very happy with our position in the coil market in europe with respect to the acquisition that you just mentioned i prefer not to comment whether that creates opportunities for us or not ill just say that we feel that weve got tremendous opportunities in the european coil market on the basis of what we own today dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc fair enough gary thank you operator thank you next we will go to the line of rosemarie morbelli with gabelli  company please go ahead rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company thank you good morning everyone gary when you talked about – i mean your refinishing business getting to about  million in revenues over the next four years to five years are you including bolton or is that purely organic growth gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer we think we can do that organically rosemarie rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company and are there potentially additional acquisitions that can be attractive in that particular side of the business gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer sure yeah there are some smaller ones there rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company okay and then i was wondering regarding and i know it is a small quarter and i know it is winter and so on but i was wondering if first of all is the customer inventory correction on the paints side was bigger than it was in previous year and two whether that shows that theyre anticipating a slowdown in housing gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer no i dont think it shows that at all in fact the housing market in north america appears to be pretty strong again rosemarie if this level of correction or if this level of change on a yearoveryear basis happened in our q we wouldnt be talking about it because it would be immaterial and its really immaterial in q but it has an impact on a very small quarter for us so we called it out rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company okay that was very fair gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer the only reason we called it out is because this quarter is an unusual quarter for us for many reasons and we thought it would be helpful to our investors to understand that our plan in coatings is right on or above plan and in paints was what would have been right on our plan – our internal plan had it not been for this modest correction thats the only reason we called it out rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company okay im glad you did because i was freaking out looking at that margin gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer well you shouldnt freak out looking at that margin for the reasons that jim just said we delever extraordinarily in the first quarter because its such a small quarter and all of the costs that in our business remain in our business in the first quarter if you look historically the first quarter is always the weakest quarter that we have in paints and theres absolutely no reason to be freaked out about a  basis point decline in q rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company all right thank you operator thank you and our final question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport global securities please go ahead your line is open michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc hi can you hear me gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah we got you mike michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc hi gary youre getting some increases in distribution of the cabot stain line in north america how important could that be to the growth rate this year and just looking at last year were sales depressed in stains due to the weather gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer well the answer to your first question mike is that its – all of these we knew about these opportunities as we went into our year so theyre baked into our guidance cabot is very broadly distributed now i think its something like  points of distribution in north america which is by far the most widelydistributed premium stain product that is in our market so we fully expect that were going to grow this business as we move forward through time but at least for this year as i said its baked into our guidance yeah last year on your second question whether we expect a better stain season this year than last year i think we will unless we have – we had horrific weather last year and we missed a good portion of the stain season which is march april may consumers have – if you dont get it done in may a lot of people decide – by may – they decide to defer until the next year so its possible that we could see some upside on our plan based on weather patterns michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc all right and then a question on china and just the consumer paint business youve talked about increasing the number of distribution points in china how should we think about that contributing to overall volume growth in asia and sort of when should we see the increase in channels translate to an increase in volumes and some of the share gains that youre referring to gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer i think weve seen that over the last several years taking place so that has been the ongoing formula that our team in china has been executing as gary mentioned the unknown for this year is what type of headwinds are we going to have from a macro perspective but once again our share is very small in that marketplace and we have continued opportunities to grow we know we just need to manage through these temporary headwinds and well continue to grow our brand there michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc all right thanks very much gary e hendrickson  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you
