companies » exclusive interview with dr jonathan wang orbimed asia seeks partners for portfolio companies exclusive interview with dr jonathan wang orbimed asia seeks partners for portfolio companies publication date feb      authorsource richard daverman phd previous  nextnbsp dr jonathan wang is senior managing director of orbimed asia which he cofounded in  he has over  years of life science experience including investment entrepreneurship and research he holds a phd in molecular neurobiology from columbia university and an mba from stanford university chinabio tell us about orbimed where does it fit into the world of vcpe firms dr wang orbimed is a  yearold healthcare and life sciencesdedicated investment firm we believe we are the largest investment firm in the world that is dedicated to healthcare and life sciences in terms of assets under management we have five offices around the world including shanghai and mumbai in asia orbimed has made over  private equity investments in asia we have made  orbimed asia has close to  million in private equity funds in addition orbimed has invested approximately  million in public companies in china chinabio and you consider yourself a pe firm rather than vc dr wang orbimed’s investment scope is broad we do all stages of investments including vc pe and public equity in asia we have been heavily focused on the early growth stage although we sometimes do vc investments as well orbimed asia’s target investment size averages between  and  million per company in most cases we are larger and later than typical life science vcs chinabio what do you look for in a partner how much of the equation is technology how much is management dr wang we are an investment firm so we would use our global network to look for partners for our portfolio companies rather than for ourselves what we are looking for depends on the portfolio companies often we are looking for mature pharmaceutical or medical device products from overseas these products are sometimes in or close to the market in the us or europe the therapeutic areas which we are focused on depend on the portfolio company we are helping  for example we are looking for antiinfective gi and bone pharmaceutical products for waterstone one of our portfolio companies we have medical device portfolio companies as well chemclin is a leader in china’s ivd industry and ea in the transparent dental braces industry we would seek products or partners for them as well the structures of the deals vary sometimes it’s a basic licensing a company would simply pay for the china right to a pharmaceutical product at other times the product is at an earlier stage and you need to do codevelopment so the deal would be more complex the chinese company would take care of the local development and registration process in china a deal would typically involve upfront milestone and royalty payments sometimes jvs are formed i would say both technology and management are important in a partner but their “weights” would obviously vary under different circumstances in a straight licensing deal the partner’s management may not be as important as in a jv chinabio how long do you plan to stay invested before making an exit dr wang we are longterm investors typically we remain with a company somewhere between two and seven years our asia private equity funds are structured with a tenyear life span with the possibility to extend twice one year each most chinese rmb funds’ life spans are shorter typically three to five years and eight years is the longest i directly know orbimed asia can afford to stay with portfolio companies for a longer period of time chinabio how close is the relationship what kind of contact do you have dr wang we are on the boards of most of our companies we play active roles to help and support the management but we are not involved in daily operations we take roles on important subcommittees such as compensation and audit committees occasionally i have been chairman under special circumstances usually we are minority shareholders and we generally do not seek majority ownership chinabio what does orbimed bring to the relationship dr wang first as mentioned earlier using our global industry network we often look for overseas partners and products to help our companies in asia secondly using our domain knowledge we offer strategic support entrepreneurs are usually deeply involved in their own business so they sometimes lack a broad view of the industry we often see many companies in their sector across different developmental stages so we can help our portfolio companies with their strategic decision making by better understanding the competitive landscape thirdly we help our portfolio companies on ipo or ma exits orbimed has several billion dollars invested in healthcare public equity across many stock markets we often use our brand name knowledge and relationships to help our companies in the ipo process fourthly we often use our industry network to help recruit talented people to enhance the management team we also help our companies on many other issues such as ip protection corporate governance and accounting we may introduce reputable service firms such as accounting and ip law firms with which we have longterm relationships to our portfolio companies chinabio what are orbimed asia’s investment focus areas dr wang we are trying to reach a balance among products such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices services such as hospitals and lab services and cost advantagebased opportunities such as cros and cmos out of the  portfolio companies in asia five of them develop or make drugs chinabio how sophisticated is china science is it the equal of the west dr wang it’s amazing how fast china science has been improving china’s basic research and innovation started from a low point but is growing rapidly according to a recent article in the new england journal of medicine china’s biomedical rd expenditure more than quadrupled in five years from  billion in  to  billion in  many excellent scientists trained at leading western institutes have returned to china so the best science in china is very good but the overall quality is still lagging behind the west chinabio what brought you back to china dr wang investment opportunity in china was one of the most important reasons as an investment firm we are looking for growth in china the healthcare sector has been doubling every four years or so driven by an aging population urbanization and economic growth the country is catching up with japan to become the number two worldwide in terms of market size there has been tremendous growth i am attracted to good businesses which depend on good people and many good people have moved to china the huge influx of overseas returnees has brought back talented people in both management and research let me use bayhelix as an example to show you how many good people have migrated twelve years ago steve yang and i cofounded bayhelix a byinvitationonly nonprofit organization of executives in china’s healthcare and life sciences sector the largest number of our members was from the san francisco bay area then but today the city with the most bayhelix members approximately  is shanghai because many of us have moved in addition to good people other success factors important for good businesses have matured rapidly in the recent years as a result we are experiencing a strong deal flow in china thank you for your time and insight dr wang
