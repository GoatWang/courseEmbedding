debt typically consists of commercial loans senior to other loans and debt in a companys capital structure and may also include certain floating rate preferred debt securities floating rate senior

investmentgrade securities in the event of liquidation investors in these types of loans are given the highest priority for repayment – before holders of preferred and common stock and subordinated bondholders floating rate debt income typically rises as shortterm interest rates rise as the loans are structured to pay interest based on short term rates plus some additional percentage known as a spread this means they tend to have low or negative correlation with most bond indexes since floating rate funds usually carry lower credit ratings or no credit rating at all income is expected to be higher in market environments when higher rates are demanded from poor or unrated credits vs highly rated or governmentguaranteed securities wide credit spreads the types of collateral used to secure floating rate senior loans include accounts receivable inventory equipment and machinery real estate companies typically targeted by portfolio managers may include hotelrestaurantentertainment and

interest rates rise as the loans are structured to pay interest based on short term rates plus some additional percentage known as a spread this means they tend to have low or negative correlation with most bond indexes since floating rate funds usually carry lower credit ratings or no credit rating at all income is expected to be higher in market environments when higher rates are demanded from poor or unrated credits vs highly rated or governmentguaranteed securities wide credit spreads the types of collateral used to secure floating rate senior loans include accounts receivable

factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
