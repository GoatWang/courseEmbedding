debtits time to stop borrowing pay off debt and regain control of where your money goes without car student loan credit card and installment loan payments that likely total  per month it would be easy to save for purchases and a secure retirement start now it wont happen overnight but you can be debtfree and financially secure  regardless of your current income and debt levelsif you have adequate equity in your home you may want to consider refinancing your mortgage and using the equity to eliminate the other debt the interest rate is likely much lower and mortgage interest is tax deductible if this is not a viable option for you the following debt elimination strategy is effective first save  in an emergency fund so you have a small safetynet during the debtelimination process second tackle debt using the snowball approach as follows  list all debts in ascending order from smallest balance to largest you may also order them by highest to lowest interest rate if you prefercommit to pay the minimum payment due on every debtdetermine how much extra can be applied towards the smallest debt the more you can commit the faster you will be out of debtpay the minimum payment on the smallest debt plus the extra amount until it is paid offonce a smallest debt is paid in full add the amount you were paying on the first debt to the minimum of the second smallest debt plus any extra you can affordrepeat until all debts are paid in fullby the time the final debts are reached the extra amount paid toward the larger debts will grow quickly similar to a snowball rolling downhill gathering more snow  michelle jacoby february   portfolio diversification what are the elements of a healthy financial plan michelle jacoby february   portfolio diversification one of the most important things you can do for yourself and your family is to develop and stick to a financial plan in doing so it is strongly recommended that you consult an experienced financial planner who can help you understand your current situation identify your goals and put strategies in place to reach those goals regardless of your individual goalswhether to live a comfortable retirement educate your children travel the world live a debtfree life or leave your loved ones a significant inheritancethe foundation of any healthy financial plan must encompass strategies for building wealth and strategies for protecting your wealth strategies to save and build wealth there are two distinctive types of savings to which a healthy financial plan gives considerationcash reserve  establish a cash reserve for larger purchases vacations and emergency situations eg job loss carhouse repairs etc your cash reserve is the money by which you live a fullyfunded cash reserveapproximately three months salarygives you the ability to handle unforeseen expenses and plan for the things you want to buy and do without threatening your monthly expenses or investments a financial planner can help you establish a cash management plan to maximize your discretionary income after bills prepare for emergencies and save for the things you wantinvestment portfolio  the second type of savings plan is an investment portfoliothe money by which you grow an investment portfolio is absolutely essential to your meeting your longterm financial security goals there are many factors that should be considered when establishing an investment portfolio including how much you will need to retire how much you expect your pension andor social security to contribute how many years until your retirement and so on with this information your financial planner will help you make the right kind of investments strategies to protect savings and investments a new transmission for your car or having to replace a leaky roof will probably not put you into financial ruin especially if you have a fullyfunded cash reserve however disability and death have the potential to wipe out your entire savings and retirement income very quickly in addition to the standard insurances that most people carry eg health auto homeowners etc the following types of insurances are critical to a healthy financial planlife insurance  life insurance protects those who depend on your income  your spouse children etc upon your death your life insurance policy will pay your beneficiary a lump sum that can replace your lost income pay off outstanding expenses house car cover funeral expenses andor provide an education for your children the various types of life insurances will be explored in a future article disability insurance  disability insurance is often one of the most overlooked forms of insurance but is extremely beneficial when needed disability insurance replaces a portion of your lost income if you become unable to perform your job because of injury or illness many companies offer disability insurance as an employee benefit but typically it only covers  percent of base salary minus taxes discuss whether you may need additional coverage with your financial planner long term care insurance  seven in  people will need some type of long term care there are two ways to pay for long term care  either out of your own pocket or with long term care insurance neither personal health insurance nor medicare will cover many long term care expenses as many of the needed services bathing dressing and eating are not medically necessary in nature medicaid is the government program that covers long term care expenses but as the payer of last resort you will not be eligible for medicaid until you have nearly depleted all of your income and savings michelle jacoby january   savings lets think outside the box ways to save in  michelle jacoby january   savings tip change your tax withholdingsare you giving the federal government an interestfree loan every year if you get an annual refund from the irs the answer is yes your employer deducts federal income taxes from each of your paychecks based on the number of “allowances” you claim on your w the form you filled out when you were hired many people claim zero allowances—having the maximum amount of taxes taken—and then file their return with exemptions and other deductions to receive a tax refund essentially they are overpaying their income taxes why not pay an amount closer to your actual taxes and increase your weekly discretionary income and have more to save and investpeople love getting a tax refund who wouldn’t love having   or even  deposited into their checking account each spring many even argue that their tax refund is their savings account they use their annual refund for larger purchases vacation to pay off holiday debt etcbut here’s the brutal truth it’s not smart savings and if you are not in a position to handle an unforeseen circumstance you don’t need to be going on a vacation or buying a big screen tv above and to the right is an actual example of how one person began investing over  per year without feeling a strain on her daytoday living or monthly budgetby simply changing the allowances on her w from zero to two she was able to start investing  of her income  bimonthly but her takehome pay only decreased by  plus her company—like many companies—matches her contribution up to five percent hence her actual annual investment is  this example is intended as an illustration only and does

insurance you often think of something that you ‘should’ have and you may not have fully taken part of this level of peace of mind  life insurance can help you as you approach retirement and prepare your estate it will allow you to maximize your defined benefit qualified pension plan  while some employers are moving away from using pensions many people who are approaching retirement age may still be contributing to a pension planthis method of using life insurance while coupled with a pension plan is known as pension maximization this strategy of maximizing a pension payout is specifically for those who are married pension maximization allows the holder of the pension plan to maximize pension payouts while gaining the death benefit protection for their spousesteps for taking advantage of pension maximization read the parameters of the pension plan and discover what it includes  does it include health insurance or other similar benefits are you healthy enough to take out a life insurance policy make the decision that you will use the “life only benefit” payout option take out a life insurance policy to supplement the “life only benefit” payout before the time of retirement list your spouse as beneficiary of the life insurance planpension maximization strategy will allow the holder of the pension plan control protection and peace of mind that their spouse will be secure after their passing  upon the passing of the plan holder the spouse will receive death benefit from the life insurance policy which is generally income taxfree but will not receive any more

ability of the insurance company   michelle jacoby december   maximizing your pension michelle jacoby december   when you’re approaching retirement age you not only worry about replacing your income but also ensuring that your spouse is taken care of should you pass  for those people who have a traditional pension plan also known as a defined benefit plan they have a difficult decision to make as they approach retirement  should an individual receive the maximum payout of the pension plan known as a “life only benefit” or should you receive a joint pension payout known as a” joint and survivor benefit” so that the payments will continue beyond the passing of the primary personwhile it is important to understand what type of provisions your pension plan has it is also important to determine your family’s budget needs at the time of retirement  if you believe that you may need a higher income and you are in good health then you may want to make the most of your pension plan while you are livingone way people maximize their pension payout is to accept the singlelife pension payout or “life only benefit” generally this would give the owner a larger pension amount every month while foregoing the payout to their spouse after their death  if the primary owner chooses the “life only benefit” they should obtain a life insurance policy naming their spouse as the beneficiary  their spouse would receive the death benefit from the life insurance policy taxfree essentially replacing the pension payments that will stop at the time of the primary owner’s death  their spouse can then invest the lump sum of money to provide income for later yearsprior to making any pension decision the primary owner should determine if they can qualify for a life insurance policy and that the life insurance policy it is an appropriate amount to cover expenses as well as investquestions to ask yourself prior to taking part in pension maximization do you need a larger monthly payout amount at the time of retirement is your retirement health insurance coupled with your pension  if so will health insurance carry over to your spouse once you pass are you healthy enough to take out a life insurance plan on your own what is your tax bracket  pension payouts are considered fully taxable will your spouse be financial stable when you pass how long is your spouse projected to live past you how much life insurance would your spouse need to ensure that your spouse is taken care for the rest of their lifebenefits of selecting the pension maximization strategy are should your spouse predecease you then your heirs will receive the remaining life insurance benefits upon your death  with a pension often heirs will not receive any funding upon your death you have financial control of how much benefit your spouse will receive upon your death by selecting the appropriate amount of death benefit from the life insurance plan if you select the “life only benefit” you have the potential of accessing any accumulated cash values of the pension plan such as accepting the funds as a lump sum sourceshttpwwwinvestopediacomaskanswerswhatispensionmaximizationasphttpwwwinvestopediacomarticlespersonalfinanceprosandconspensionmaximizationasphttpswwwnorthamericancompanycomdocumentsnampdfcccfdabccd

to your social security and medicare benefits michelle jacoby december   retirement social security is economic security for retired disabled people or families of retired disabled or diseased workers many people today are engulfed with promotions and invitation of benefits and security system seminars on how to maximize their social security income on november nd  the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of  which has put an end to loopholes used in the past while filing forbenefits and made significant changes to the benefits system now what has changed according to new budget actthe biggest change for claiming social security benefits is that the “file and suspend” strategy has been abolished previously married couples could maximize their social security benefits by having one spouse file for retirement benefits then suspending the benefits shortly after filing typically the person who is suspending the benefits is the individual who has had a higher earnings record this strategy allowed married couples to file spousal benefits and receive higher benefits based on the lower income of the spouseunder the bipartisan budget act when a person files for suspension of benefits not only does the individual not receive any benefits during the suspension period but his or her spouse also does not receive any spousal benefits any current retirement benefits claims will not be affected however the bipartisan budget act will apply towards new file and suspend benefit claimsanother benefit strategy that has been eliminated is using the process of restricted applications this strategy is mainly used to increase the overall longevity of one’s social security benefits when an individual reaches full retirement age and is eligible for both the spousal benefits and his or her own benefits they can file a restricted application to only receive the spousal benefits by doing so they delay receiving their own retirement benefits in order to earn the delayed retirement credits these delayed credits increase social security benefits by  a yearunder the rules of the bipartisan budget act when you file for social security benefits you are simultaneously filing for both your spousal benefits and your individual benefits for those people who turn  after  they will have two options for claiming their social security benefits either they can start claiming benefits anytime at or after turning  and receive a lower total amount of benefits or they can delay receiving benefits until they are older as late as  in order to maximize their benefit amount but not receive any benefits until that timean additional benefit of the bipartisan budget act is that it sets the premium rates for people who receive medicare part b coverage and there will not be an increase for most people in  people who have their medicare premiums deducted out of their social security benefits will not see an increase in rates for  this is roughly  of americans who are covered with medicare part b however the other  of people will see their premium rates rise from  to approximately  per month this is due to the fact that there was no costofliving increase the premium increase is considered a relief for those people who fallunder the  category otherwise they would have had to incur the full load of the medicare increase which would have been

borrowing pay off debt and regain control of where your money goes without car student loan credit card and installment loan payments that likely total  per month it would be easy to save for purchases and a secure retirement start now it wont happen overnight but you can be debtfree and financially secure  regardless of your current income and debt levelsif you have adequate equity in your home you may want to consider refinancing your mortgage and using the equity to eliminate the other debt the interest rate is likely much lower and mortgage interest is tax deductible if this is not a viable option for you the following debt elimination strategy is effective first save  in an emergency fund so you have a small safetynet during the debtelimination process second tackle debt using the snowball approach as follows  list all debts in ascending order from smallest balance to largest you may also order them by highest to lowest interest rate if you prefercommit to pay the minimum payment due on every debtdetermine how much extra can be applied towards the smallest debt the more you can commit the faster you will be out of debtpay the minimum payment on the smallest debt plus the extra amount until it is paid offonce a smallest debt is paid in full add the amount you were paying on the first debt to the minimum of the second smallest debt plus any extra you can affordrepeat until all debts are paid in fullby the time the final debts are reached the extra amount paid toward the larger debts will grow quickly similar to a snowball rolling downhill gathering more snow  michelle jacoby january   savings lets think outside the box ways to save in  michelle jacoby january   savings tip change your tax withholdingsare you giving the federal government an interestfree loan every year if you get an annual refund from the irs the answer is yes your employer deducts federal income taxes from each of your paychecks based on the number of “allowances” you claim on your w the form you filled out when you were hired many people claim zero allowances—having the maximum amount of taxes taken—and then file their return with exemptions and other deductions to receive a tax refund essentially they are overpaying their income taxes why not pay an amount closer to your actual taxes and increase your weekly discretionary income and have more to save and investpeople love getting a tax refund who wouldn’t love having   or even  deposited into their checking account each spring many even argue that their tax refund is their savings account they use their annual refund for larger purchases vacation to pay off holiday debt etcbut here’s the brutal truth it’s not smart savings and if you are not in a position to handle an unforeseen circumstance you don’t need to be going on a vacation or buying a big screen tv above and to the right is an actual example of how one person began investing over  per year without feeling a strain on her daytoday living or monthly budgetby simply changing the allowances on her w from zero to two she was able to start investing  of her income  bimonthly but her takehome pay only decreased by  plus her company—like many companies—matches her contribution up to five percent hence her actual annual investment is  this example is intended as an illustration only and does not reflect the performance of any specific investment and should not be considered financial advice michelle jacoby october   savings how much do i need in cash reserves michelle jacoby october   savings industry experts say that

clients i am writing you today to share a situation that has been brewing on capital hill for some time and is getting very close to becoming a reality  the department of labor wants to change the way an american works with their financial advisors regarding ira accounts  we at beacon financial group are able to do both fee based and commission based programs and currently there is freedom of choice for the product a client and advisor can choose  some clients feel it is appropriate to have a fee based relationship and others feel the commission program is more suitable  most likely this will end soon as a ruling is currently being finalized by the department of labor to change this structure  it is very likely that advisors and clients may be limited to products and may need to change the current relationship that exists with an advisor helping you with a retirement account  i have always believed that there was democracy in this country and a very thorough process with checks and balances for a ruling or a law to be passed  it was my understanding that thoughtful debate and hearing opinions from all sides would determine the proper outcome  additionally  our leaders would have the ability to listen to their constituents and share those opinions with the rule makers before a final decision was made  the current status of the proposed regulation feels like it has been done very quickly the proposal was filed with the office of management and budget omb on january   and the omb is expected to respond in less than the  days permitted under the law it will then be posted in the federal register with an effective date that is no less than  days after publication to allow for congressional review   ironically the majority of advisors i speak to as well as almost every client who has an ira account is totally unaware of the potential game changer being proposed by the us department of labor  they are proposing that all ira accounts need to fall under the dols fiduciary standard for retirement plans under the erisa act of   what that means to you is any ira account that you have whether it is managed at beacon financial group or somewhere else may need to change  it may even go so far to say that the advisor or firm that you are working with cannot continue to provide advice to you on specific existing products or programs there is also a chance that some investments will never get an exemption or be an approved investment according to dol and may need to be liquidated or removed from the ira it has always been our philosophy at beacon financial group to support the clients right to choose their investment options and how to pay for it   as of now the final ruling is expected later this month or early april and it is premature to predict exactly what will happen with client accounts regardless of what comes out from the dol in the next month or so bfg is working hard with our current product sponsors and npc to come up with solutions to help make our relationship with you seamless click here for more informationclick here to read more on this topic stevestephen c locker cfpchief executive officerbeacon financial
