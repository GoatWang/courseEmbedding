per unit by the number of units outstanding the estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge the actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities trustcom  products home › products  bluetooth  adapter  high precision stylus pen  black
