you out thats told you to settle divided us you believe we can be one people reaching for whats possible supporting each other and building a stronger more perfect union in december with the help of our partners at technori we launched ellison on republic an online platform where everyone can invest in innovative missiondriven startups after just  short days after we launched ellison hit our goal and was named the fastest equity crowdfunding campaign in chicago  now its considered one of the largest on the platform exceeding our goal by over   republiccoellison this is important for more than just ellison  it’s a big step forward in the third wave of democratizing startup financing the first wave began with rewardbased crowdfunding portals like indiegogo and kickstarter where people everywhere could help fund product development with a donation the next wave known as title ii crowdfunding sparked a breakthrough change enabling angel investors to fund startups through online fundraising platforms like angellist yet that second wave harnesses only a fraction of equity crowdfunding’s potential available to wealthy “accredited investors” only it leaves out  of the us population thereby limiting the opportunity for a fuller range of startups founders and investors to engage with one another republic addresses that limitation and gives companies like ellison a chance to succeed on republic entrepreneurs can access a vast new source of capital investments from the general public and everyone — from main street to wall street — can share in the potential success of innovative startups they choose to back this is a big step and it hasn’t come easily after years of lobbying effort angel investing became legally accessible to main street for the first time this year thanks to the approval of title iii legislation it will take partnership and perseverance to convert this policy shift into a market reality at scale from main street to wall street now everyone can participate in the journey of a new startup why ellison has taken on this challenge as a team we believe passionately in the power of entrepreneurship and that today is only a glimmer of the real opportunity ahead it takes money to help grow a kernel of idea into an impactful business yet the flow of venture capital only benefits a selected few our experience and research shows a startup financing system that is localized focused on software startups and biased against women and minority groups consider these facts although some  of us small businesses which generates nearly half of privatesector employment and a significant share of ongoing gdp are founded by women “female founded” startups account for only  of vc fundingfewer than  of venture funded businesses are run by female ceos while the proportion of female partners in us venture firms currently hovers at around venture investments totaled  billion in  with more than  percent of that funding going to app startups and  percent to companies based in californiablack americans represent more than  of our population yet only  of vc investment professionals are black the saying “talent is equally distributed but opportunity is not” may be true — but that can change innovations are gender neutral and good businesses exist in all parts of our country financing sources too should be equally distributed opportunities await in gaps and this gap is huge for startups equity crowdfunding is a gateway to a vast source of capital but that’s not all investment crowdfunding also presents a tremendous marketing opportunity through which a startup can convert casual customers and supporters into loyal brand ambassadors indeed angel investing is about building a support network as much as it’s about operating capital imagine if you converted your casual customers and supporters into loyal brand ambassadors republic’s vision for investors like you for main street investors investing is a powerful way to join an entrepreneur’s journey starting a company is one way to create impact and the potential for high returns but not everyone can make that leap with equity crowdfunding anyone can invest and share in the success of businesses they find compelling our goal is to ensure that investors understand the risks and rewards associated with angel investing and to present them with innovative companies that meet our criteriastarting a company like ellison is one way to drive impact you want to see in the world being an investor backing a startup you believe in is another investing in startups is risky but it’s more productive than minimal return gambles such as lotteries which drained some  billion from main street america’s pockets in  alone if americans directed a portion of the staggering  billion in annual gambling losses toward funding entrepreneurship and innovation what change — and economic value — might be achieved each and every time a new generation has risen up and done whats needed to be done today we are called once more and it is time for our generation to answer that call lets be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we

company to compete and grow it must attract recruit retain and develop the necessary personnel who have the needed experience recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel is critical to our success these demands may require us to hire additional personnel and will require our existing management personnel to develop additional expertise we face intense competition for personnel the failure to attract and retain personnel or to develop such expertise could delay or halt the development and commercialization of our product candidates if we experience difficulties in hiring and retaining personnel in key positions we could suffer from delays in product development loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources which could adversely affect operating results our consultants and advisors may be employed by third parties and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that may limit their availability to us the development and commercialization of our products is highly competitive we face competition in the eyewear industry with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future our competitors include major companies worldwide one company in particular luxottica group spa luxottica holds a virtual monopoly in the industry holding a controlling stake in major eyewear brands such as lenscrafters sunglass hut and target optical and producing sunglasses and prescription frames for major designer brands such as chanel and prada luxottica and other of our competitors such as jand inc dba warby parker warby parker have significantly greater financial technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in research and development and marketing approved products and thus may be better equipped than us to develop and commercialize products these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and acquiring technologies smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies accordingly our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we are able to which would adversely affect our competitive position the likelihood that our products will achieve initial market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful additional revenues from our products we rely on other companies to provide the raw materials and major components of our products we outsource production of our eyewear frames to manufacturers in greece and italy and we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and costeffective manner likewise the quality of our products may be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of raw materials or major components for our products or from whom we acquire such items do not provide the raw materials or major components which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers expectations our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations the risk of these adverse effects may be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular component we depend on thirdparty service providers and outsource providers for a variety of services and we outsource a number of our noncore functions and operations in certain instances we rely on single or limited service providers and outsourcing vendors around the world because the relationship is advantageous due to quality price and lack of alternative sources if production or service were interrupted and we were not able to find alternate thirdparty providers we could experience disruptions in manufacturing and operations including product shortages higher freight costs and reengineering costs if outsourcing services are interrupted or not performed or the performance is poor this could impact our ability to process record and report transactions with our customers and other constituents such interruptions in the provision of supplies andor services could result in our inability to meet customer demand damage our reputation and customer relationships and adversely affect our business we depend on third party providers suppliers and licensors to supply some of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services we obtain these materials from a limited number of vendors some of which do not have a long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire some of our hardware software and operational support vendors represent our sole source of supply or have either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights a position of some exclusivity if demand exceeds these vendors capacity or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner at our specifications and at reasonable prices our ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our customers these events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and have a material negative impact on our operations business financial results and financial condition we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and contractors in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of our products in other circumstances we may be required to obtain additional export licenses before exporting our products compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory the companys success depends on the experience and skill of the board of directors its executive officers and key employees in particular the company is dependent on john roa ravi patel and aristotle loumis who are respectively an advisor cofounder and cofounder and chief executive officer of the company the company has or intends to enter into employment agreements with aristotle loumis and other key personnel although there can be no assurance that it will do so or that such persons will continue to be employed or engaged by the company for a particular period of time the loss of any of john roa ravi patel or aristotle loumis could harm the companys business financial condition cash flow and results of operations we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the materials used in the manufacturing of our products in  the following suppliers provided the following percentage of the listed services inputs or raw materials nea optiki sa  of our gross manufacturing carl zeiss ag of our eyewear lenses and mazzucchelli  spa  of acetate needed for our eyewear frames if any of these suppliers changed its sales strategy to reduce its reliance on distribution channels or decided to terminate its business relationship with us sales and earnings could be adversely affected until we are able to establish relationships with suppliers of comparable products any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers could materially adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations most of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on short notice for any reason although we believe our relationships with these key suppliers are good they could change their strategies as a result of a change in control expansion of their direct sales force changes in the marketplace or other factors beyond our control including a key supplier becoming financially distressed we rely on various intellectual property rights including trademarks in order to operate our business such intellectual property rights however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage in addition the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights as we expand our business protecting our intellectual property will become increasingly important the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter our competitors from using our proprietary information in order to protect or enforce our patent rights we may be required to initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement lawsuits also these third parties may assert claims against us with or without provocation these lawsuits could be expensive take significant time and could divert managements attention from other business concerns the law relating to the scope and validity of claims in the technology field in which we operate is still evolving and consequently intellectual property positions in our industry are generally uncertain we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these potential suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded if any would be commercially valuable although dependent on certain key personnel the company does not have any key man life insurance policies on any such people the company is dependent on john roa ravi patel and aristotle loumis in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan however the company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to those individuals in the event of their death or disability therefore in any of john roa ravi patel and aristotle loumis die or become disabled the company will not receive any compensation to assist with such persons absence the loss of such person could negatively affect the company and its operations we have not prepared any audited financial statements while the company has prepared reviewed financial statements in connection with this offering we have not prepared any audited financial statements to date therefore you have no audited financial information regarding the companys capitalization or assets or liabilities on which to make your investment decision if you feel the information provided is insufficient you should not invest in the company we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable i there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our income tax provisions expense amounts for nonincome based taxes and accruals and ii any material differences could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made we are not subject to sarbanesoxley regulations and lack the financial controls and safeguards required of public companies we do not have the internal infrastructure necessary and are not required to complete an attestation about our financial controls that would be required under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  there can be no assurance that there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of our financial controls we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of managements time if and when it becomes necessary to perform the system and process evaluation testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements the company has indicated that it has engaged in certain transactions with related persons please see the section of this memorandum entitled transactions with related persons and conflicts of interest for further details changes in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs these laws include minimum wage requirements overtime pay healthcare reform and the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements union membership and sales taxes a number of factors could adversely affect our operating results including additional governmentimposed increases in minimum wages overtime pay paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits mandated training for employees increased tax reporting and tax payments changing regulations from the national labor relations board and increased employee litigation including claims relating to the fair labor standards act maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation increasing attention on marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not establish maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand offer new products to meet those changes and respond to competitive innovation consumer preferences our products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease we must distinguish between shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied customer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations in addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our business we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the price and supply of ingredients packaging materials and freight the prices of the components of our products packaging materials and freight are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to among other things changes in supply and demand of raw materials and fuel prices the sales prices to our customers are a delivered price therefore changes in our input costs could impact our gross margins our ability to pass along higher costs through price increases to our customers is dependent upon competitive conditions and pricing methodologies employed in the various markets in which we compete to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to lowerpriced private label or other value offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations we use significant quantities of raw materials as well as packaging materials provided by thirdparty suppliers we buy from a variety of producers and manufacturers and alternate sources of supply are generally available however the supply and price are subject to market conditions and are influenced by other factors beyond our control we do not have longterm contracts with many of our suppliers and as a result they could increase prices or fail to deliver the occurrence of any of the foregoing could increase our costs and disrupt our operations substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur a disruption in production at our thirdparty manufacturing facilities could have an adverse effect on our business in addition a disruption could occur at the facilities of our suppliers or distributors the disruption could occur for many reasons including fire natural disasters weather water scarcity manufacturing problems disease strikes transportation or supply interruption government regulation cybersecurity attacks or terrorism alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production each of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations future product recalls could adversely impact our results of operations we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled tampered with or damaged a product recall could have an adverse effect on our business depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image we also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the quality of our products changes in raw material and manufacturing input prices could adversely affect our business and results of operations because pricing for the majority of our cellulose specialty fibers customers is set annually we typically have very limited ability to pass along fluctuations in costs to customers after pricing has been established raw material costs and energy are a significant operating expense the cost of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions political unrest instability in energyproducing nations and supply and demand considerations price increases and general volatility could adversely affect our business and results of operations any disruption in our information systems could disrupt our operations and would be adverse to our business and results of operations we depend on various information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business including managing orders supplies accounting controls and payroll any inability to successfully manage the procurement development implementation or execution of our information systems and backup systems including matters related to system security reliability performance and access as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations such disruptions may not be covered by our business interruption insurance the potential impact of failing to deliver products on time could increase the cost of our products in most instances we guarantee that we will deliver a product by a scheduled date if we subsequently fail to deliver the product as scheduled we may be held responsible for cost impacts andor other damages resulting from any delay to the extent that these failures to deliver occur the total damages for which we could be liable could significantly increase the cost of the products as such we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that contract additionally failure to deliver products on time could result in damage to customer relationships the potential loss of customers and reputational damage which could impair our ability to attract new customers many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules which makes it difficult for us to schedule production accurately and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity many of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules and we continue to experience reduced leadtimes in customer orders additionally customers may change production quantities or delay production with little leadtime or advance notice therefore we rely on and plan our production and inventory levels based on our customers advance orders commitments or forecasts as well as our internal assessments and forecasts of customer demand the variations in volume and timing of sales make it difficult to schedule production and optimize utilization of manufacturing capacity this uncertainty may require us to increase staffing and incur other expenses in order to meet an unexpected increase in customer demand potentially placing a significant burden on our resources additionally an inability to respond to such increases may cause customer dissatisfaction which may negatively affect our customers relationships further in order to secure sufficient production scale we may make capital investments in advance of anticipated customer demand such investments may lead to low utilization levels if customer demand forecasts change and we are unable to utilize the additional capacity additionally we order materials and components based on customer forecasts and orders and suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum quantities that exceed customer requirements which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations such order fluctuations and deferrals may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations failure to execute our opportunistic buying could adversely affect our business we purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing close to need while opportunistic buying provides our buyers the ability to buy at desirable times and prices in the quantities we need and into market trends it places considerable discretion in our buyers subjecting us to risks related to the pricing quantity nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores if we are unable to provide frequent replenishment of fresh high quality attractively priced merchandise in our stores it could adversely affect traffic to our stores as well as our sales and margins we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to markdown excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance we need to purchase inventory sufficiently below conventional retail to maintain our pricing differential to regular department and specialty store prices and to attract customers and sustain our margins which we may not achieve at various times and which could adversely affect our results our business may be adversely affected by catastrophic events and extreme or unseasonable weather conditions unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts public health issues and natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes or tornadoes whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our supply chain operations international trade or result in political or economic instability any of the foregoing events could result in property losses reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to obtain merchandise from our suppliers decreases in discretionary consumer spending may have an adverse effect on us our eyewear products are products that consumers may view as discretionary items rather than necessities as a result our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending difficult macroeconomic conditions particularly high levels of unemployment also impact our customers ability to obtain consumer credit other factors including consumer confidence employment levels interest rates tax rates consumer debt levels and fuel and energy costs could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits slowdowns in the us or global economy or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits and our results of operations if we do not continue to source new products our ability to compete will be undermined and we may be unable to implement our business plan our ability to compete in the direct marketing industry and to expand into the traditional retail environment depends to a great extent on our ability to develop or acquire new innovative products under particular brands and to complement these products with related families of products under those brandsif we do not source new products as our existing products mature through their product life cycles or if we do not develop related families of products under our brands we will not be able to implement our business plan and the value of your investment may decrease our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our customer experience or provide high quality customer service the success of our business largely depends on our ability to provide superior customer experience and high quality customer service which in turn depends on a variety of factors such as our ability to continue to provide a reliable and userfriendly website interface for our customers to browse and purchase our products reliable and timely delivery of our products and superior after sales services our sales may decrease if our website services are severely interrupted or otherwise fail to meet our customer requests should we or our thirdparty delivery companies fail to provide our product delivery and return services in a convenient or reliable manner or if our customers are not satisfied with our product quality our reputation and customer loyalty could be negatively affected in addition we also depend on our call center and online customer service representatives to provide live assistance to our customers if our call center or online customer service representatives fail to satisfy the individual needs of customers our reputation and customer loyalty could be negatively affected and we may lose potential or existing customers and experience a decrease in sales as a result if we are unable to continue to maintain our customer experience and provide high quality customer service we may not be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we depend upon designers vendors and other sources of merchandise goods and services our business could be affected by disruptions in or other legal regulatory political or economic issues associated with our supply network our relationships with established and emerging designers have been a significant contributor to our past success our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is often challenging particularly with respect to goods sourced outside the united states our procurement of goods and services from outside the united states is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade in addition our procurement of all our goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers all of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business and results of operations our advertising and marketing efforts may be costly and may not achieve desired results we incur substantial expense in connection with our advertising and marketing efforts although we target our advertising and marketing efforts on current and potential customers who we believe are likely to be in the market for the products we sell we cannot assure you that our advertising and marketing efforts will achieve our desired results in addition we periodically adjust our advertising expenditures in an effort to optimize the return on such expenditures any decrease in the level of our advertising expenditures which may be made to optimize such return could adversely affect our sales we may be required to collect sales tax on our direct marketing operations with respect to the direct sales sales or other similar taxes are collected primarily in states where we have retail stores another physical presence or personal property however various states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on outofstate direct mail companies a successful assertion by one or more states that we should have collected or should be collecting sales taxes on the direct sale of our merchandise could have an adverse effect on our business government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce electronic devices and

purchase date although the safe may be tradable under federal securities law state securities regulations may apply and each purchaser shou you should be aware of the longterm nature of this investment there is not now and likely will not be a public market for the safe simple agreement for future equity because the safe has not been registered under the securities act or under the securities laws of any state or nonus jurisdiction the safe has transfer restrictions and cannot be resold in the united states except pursuant to rule  of regulation cf it is not currently contemplated that registration under the securities act or other securities laws will be effected limitations on the transfer of the safe may also adversely affect the price that you might be able to obtain for the safe in a private sale purchasers should be aware of the longterm nature of their investment in the company each purchaser in this offering will be required to represent that it is purchasing the securities for its own account for investment purposes and not with a view to resale or distribution thereof neither the offering nor the securities have been registered under federal or state securities laws leading to an absence of certain regulation applicable to the company no governmental agency has reviewed or passed upon this offering the company or any securities of the company the company also has relied on exemptions from securities registration requirements under applicable state securities laws investors in the company therefore will not receive any of the benefits that such registration would otherwise provide prospective investors must therefore assess the adequacy of disclosure and the fairness of the terms of this offering on their own or in conjunction with their personal advisors no guarantee of return on investment there is no assurance that a purchaser will realize a return on its investment or that it will not lose its entire investment for this reason each purchaser should read the form c and all exhibits carefully and should consult with its own attorney and business advisor prior to making any investment decision a majority of the company is owned by a small number of owners prior to the offering the companys current owners of  or more beneficially own  of the company subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other owners or purchasers under delaware law these owners may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring owner approval including the election of directors and approval of significant company transactions and will have significant control over the companys management and policies some of these persons may have interests that are different from those of the purchasers for example these owners may support proposals and actions that the purchasers may disagree with the concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of the company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the company which in turn could reduce the price potential purchasers are willing to pay for the company in addition these owners could use their voting influence to maintain the companys existing management delay or prevent changes in control of the company or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to owner approval the company has the right to extend the offering deadline the company may extend the offering deadline beyond what is currently stated herein this means that your investment may continue to be held in escrow while the company attempts to raise the minimum amount even after the offering deadline stated herein is reached your investment will not be accruing interest during this time and will simply be held until such time as the new offering deadline is reached without the company receiving the minimum amount at which time it will be returned to you without interest or deduction or the the company receives the minimum amount at which time it will be released to the company to be used as set forth herein upon or shortly after release of such funds to the company the securities will be issued and distributed to you purchasers will not become equity holders until the company decides to convert the securities into cf shadow securities or until an ipo or sale of the company purchasers will not have an ownership claim to the company or to any of its assets or revenues for an indefinite amount of time and depending on when and how the securities are converted the purchasers may never become equity holders of the company purchasers will not become equity holders of the company unless the company receives a future round of financing great enough to trigger a conversion and the company elects to convert the securities except for certain major investors purchasers will have no say in whether their securities are converted in any equity financing the company is under no obligation to convert the securities into cf shadow securities the type of equity securities purchasers are entitled to receive upon such conversion in certain instances such as a sale of the company an ipo or a dissolution or bankruptcy the purchasers may only have a right to receive cash to the extent available rather than equity in the company purchasers will not have voting rights even upon conversion of the securities into cf shadow securities purchasers will not have the right to vote upon matters of the company even if and when their securities are converted into cf shadow securities upon such conversion cf shadow securities will have no voting rights and even in circumstances where a statutory right to vote is provided by state law the cf shadow security holders are required to vote with the majority of the security holders in the new round of equity financing upon which the securities were converted for example if the securities are converted upon a round offering series b preferred shares the series bcf shadow security holders will be required to vote the same way as a majority of the series b preferred share holders vote thus purchasers will never be able to freely vote upon any director or other matters of the company purchasers will not be entitled to any inspection or information rights other than those required by regulation cf purchasers will not have the right to inspect the books and records of the company or to receive financial or other information from the company other than as required by regulation cf other security holders may have such rights regulation cf requires only the provision of an annual report on form car and no additional information this lack of information could put purchasers at a disadvantage in general and with respect to other security holders in a dissolution or bankruptcy of the company purchasers will be treated the same as common equity holders in a dissolution or bankruptcy of the company purchasers of securities which have not been converted will be entitled to distributions as if they were common stock holders this means that such purchasers will be at the lowest level of priority and will only receive distributions once all creditors as well as holders of more senior securities including any preferred stock holders have been paid in full if the securities have been converted into cf shadow securities the purchasers will have the same rights and preferences other than the ability to vote as the holders of the securities issued in the equity financing upon which the securities were converted purchasers will be unable to declare the security in default and demand repayment unlike convertible notes and some other securities the securities do not have any default provisions upon which the purchasers will be able to demand repayment of their investment the company has ultimate discretion as to whether or not to convert the securities upon a future equity financing and purchasers have no right to demand such conversion only in limited circumstances such as a liquidity event may the purchasers demand payment and even then such payments will be limited to the amount of cash available to the company the company may never elect to convert the securities or undergo a liquidity event the company may never receive a future equity financing or elect to convert the securities upon such future financing in addition the company may never undergo a liquidity event such as a sale of the company or an ipo if neither the conversion of the securities nor a liquidity event occurs the purchasers could be left holding the securities in perpetuity the securities have numerous transfer restrictions and will likely be highly illiquid with no secondary market on which to sell them the securities are not equity interests have no ownership rights have no rights to the companys assets or profits and have no voting rights or ability to direct the company or its actions in addition to the risks listed above businesses are often subject to risks not foreseen or fully appreciated by the management it is not possible to foresee all risks that may affect us moreover the company cannot predict whether the company will successfully effectuate the companys current business plan each prospective purchaser is encouraged to carefully analyze the risks and merits of an investment in the securities and should take into consideration when making such analysis among other the risk factors discussed above show all risks discussion   loading ellison eyewear follow
