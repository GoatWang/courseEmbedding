biogasworld fr menu close close partnership of duke energy with carbon cycle energy for renewable energy in north carolina share by simon lefebvre   political incentives such as mandatory compliances are one of the strongest catalyzers for transition and this is also true for renewable energy even if the environmental benefits are obvious it must be said that the economic return of renewable energy especially in the short term is not as interesting as with fossil fuels considering their higher energy potential fortunately as the population concerns for the environment and its sustainability has led to greater interest in this field by the public sector big corporations are becoming increasingly green in order to ease their social recognition and satisfy political mandatory compliances a good example is the renewable energy and energy portfolio standard reps which mainly explains the partnership of duke energy with carbon cycle energy for renewable energy in north carolina the reps dates back to  when north carolina officialised it on august th to become the first southeastern state of the us to adopt such a measure this law requires corporations producing and selling utilities such as electricity that renewable energy accounts for  of their energy needs specifically concerning electricity power suppliers can comply with the reps by various ways like producing or purchasing for new or existing facilities electricity coming from all types of renewable energy resources such as solar wind hydropower geothermic ocean current wave energy or any biomass resource like organic residual waste animal waste agricultural waste etc therefore north carolina’s reps is behind the partnership between duke energy de the biggest electricity provider in the us with  million customers and carbon cycle energy ce a renewable energy project development company specialized in biogas their joint project consists of a year term during which ce who will build and own the anaerobic digestion plant is expected to generate over  million mmbtus approximately  million cubic meters per year of highquality biomethane refined biogas ce’s biomethane production will then be purchased by de in order to supply about  megawatthours of electricity to four of its energy production plants for the record this is enough to fulfill  households in electricity for a year in this area also the plant which is expected to start running by mid will generate  to  jobs for its operations it follows that biogas has an obvious sustainable energy potential based on its economic viability environmental benefits as well as the social involvement it induces related to the revaluation of organic residual waste though in order to develop biogas as a major part of the global sustainability solution a push emanating from the political sphere will be necessary for every country as we can see with the de and ce partnership in north carolina the compliances required by the reps are one of the main motivations behind the project elsewhere comparable patterns are making their way through such as in the province of quebec canada indeed their recently launched oriented energy policy is aimed towards sustainability notably by fossil fuels reduction as well as renewable energy production and transition the province will be devoted to encouraging this transition by setting inter alia mandatory compliances to certain types of energy in short it is evident that the public sector has the power to regulate in order to reach global objectives in terms of sustainable development renewable energy and climate change governments should as a duty be using more this power because it works even if there is a powerful lobby by the fossil industry by simon lefebvre

cheryl mcmullen  apr   new technologies are fueling innovation in the wastetoenergy field two recent developments are set to bring projects online in north carolina and oregon based on taking agricultural waste and turning it into different kinds of energy in north carolina charlottebased electric power holding company duke energy recently signed a deal with carbon cycle energy ce to buy swine and poultry waste output from its facility planned for eastern north carolina using the captured methane gas to generate renewable electricity at four power stations ce headquartered in boulder colo will build and own the facility ce will deliver more than  million mmbtus of pipelinequality methane a year duke energy should yield about  megawatthours of renewable energy a year—enough to power about  homes for a year the renewable energy credits recs generated annually will help satisfy state mandates for electricity produced from swine and poultry waste “one of the goals of the swinederived biogas requirement in renewable energy portfolio standard reps is to assists the north carolina pork industry with development of ways to manage animal wastes” says thomas mulholland executive vice president of energy trading and risk management for ce “we are delighted that this project will do that and in turn serve not only duke energy but also the pork industry and the state of north carolina” according to north carolinas reps duke energy companies must meet specific compliance targets for swine and poultry waste duke energy is already buying electricity generated from other facilities in the state “under north carolina’s renewable energy mandate duke energy must generate  percent of its electricity from swine waste by the year  this helps us along to comply with the goal” says randy wheeless corporate communications manager for duke energy mulholland says ce produces methane gas through a technique that mimics nature’s way of breaking down organic matter “naturally occurring microbes present within digestive tracts of animals perform a biological decomposition process that converts biomass into methane other gases and residual fibers” he says “ce harnesses this process by installing digesters to do the same function—to convert biomass on a large scale into biogas downstream of the digester system we purify crude biogas to meet to customer quality specifications and inject it into a pipeline for delivery to duke energy” mulholland says this approach can be utilized in many areas of the us “some areas of the country have high concentrations of animal production which can create large volumes of animal waste” he says “our north carolina project will use animal waste as feedstock for our digesters making beneficial use of a resource out of place we believe this approach could be applied widely” duke energy views this process as carbonfree energy according to wheeless “the air emissions from using the fuel at our plants are no greater than if the waste was left to decay naturally that’s a good story he says “however this process is more expensive than traditional sources it’s even more expensive than renewable sources like solar power hopefully new projects will bring the costs down” mulholland says he sees the project as a winwinwin “the big benefit is to take a waste product which we view as a resource out of place and convert it into a useable fuel by doing this we’ll reduce harmful fugitive methane emissions reduce odors and reduce a part of duke energy’s fossil fuel consumption” he says farm waste into fuel in oregon meanwhile with support from the us department of agriculture usda minneapolisbased novus energy llc will build a  million biorefinery in boardman ore to process agricultural waste into fuels fertilizer and clean water using waste from onion and potato processing plants dairy manure seasonal plant byproducts and other waste supplied by local growers and processors as the primary feedstock novus energy plans to turn the waste into fuel natural gas organic fertilizer and other biobased products the biorefinery will be built on land owned by the port of morrow one of the largest ports in oregon novus energy’s proprietary technology novus biocatalytic conversion nbc system is an integrated biocatalytic process that converts organic feedstocks to a variety of highvalue products in one location the process converts waste into valuable “green” products and recovers clean water while eliminating pollution caused by the burning and dumping of agricultural and organic waste the nbc process separates digestion products into clean biogas hydrocarbons and organic fertilizer nonhydrocarbons and micro nutrients the highenergy content biogas can be used as a fuel on site in lieu of fossil fuels or be further processed into renewable liquid fuels the biogas is free from contaminants and does not require extensive cleaning and the company already has a buyer for the biogas “we are working with bp” says burke “they are in the market for renewable natural gas we generate biogas we compress it and clean it and convert it into renewable natural gas we have an agreement with cascade natural gas so we’ll put into their pipeline and at the injection point bp buys it from them and transports it to their customers” novus energy’s nbc gas production services use solid feedstocks such as potato peels straw corn stover and sugar beet pulp and forest products which while abundant and inexpensive are difficult to digest through standard anaerobic digestion many months are typically required to thoroughly digest these substrates burke says the nbc process digests these materials more completely and in much less time than traditional methods the process enables a plant to realize significantly higher conversions in smaller volumes this is of great interest to potential buyers says burke following blind studies and a white paper on the technology burke says the reaction of potential customers was the same “while it sounds great where can i go see that” novus then built a trailer that allowed it to take the technology to interested customers “not only can you go see it but we’ll bring it to you where we can operate it on your waste stream” burke says “so that was the first demonstration plant on a mobile platform and it was pretty unique” with the new plant things will change the oregon plant will be the company’s first fullscale commercial plant not only will it produce the biogas but it also will use the digestate a waste product of the process itself to make a mineralrich liquid natural fertilizer the initial buyer for the fertilizer is a raymond washbased company called pacific gro which sells its own fertilizer products and distributes others “so they’ll use our fertilizer to enhance some of their products and sell it stand alone” says burke the new plant will act as an intercept plant for the port of morrow where it will take a couple of waste streams from the port and giving them back cleaner water he says “today water as a commodity is cheap some day that will change and there will be more economic value for clean water” burke says usda is supporting the project with an  million loan guarantee through the biorefinery renewable chemical and biobased product manufacturing assistance program says burke which gives novus energy little risk on the loan novus is working with an oregon lender old west federal credit union to finance the project usda hopes to finalize loan terms with novus and old west by summer “so depending on your equity to debt ratio it establishes how much usda will back and in our instance they’ll back  percent of the loan” usda has put its stamp of approval on the project “usda is proud to support innovative biobased projects such as this one” rural development under secretary lisa mensah said in a press release “this biorefinery will spur economic development create new jobs and provide new markets for farm commodities in rural oregon” on a daily basis the plant is expected to generate  million cubic feet of renewable natural gas  gallons of liquid fertilizer and  tons of material that can improve soil physically or chemically to make it more suitable for plant growth the facility also is expected to return approximately  gallons of treated water to the port of morrow daily  novus energy expects to hire up to  people to operate and maintain the plant and indirectly create another  to  support jobs burke says the company could break ground on the new plant

our  step process why incorporate general faqs our guaranteethe benefits of incorporatingincorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate today  or call  want to
