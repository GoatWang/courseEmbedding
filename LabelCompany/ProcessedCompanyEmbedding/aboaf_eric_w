q  slide presentation under the heading forwardlooking statements and in our sec filings including the risk factors section of our  form k our forwardlooking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change now let me turn it over to jay joseph l hooley  state street corp thanks anthony and good morning everyone our first quarter  results reflect our business momentum across asset servicing and asset management strong fee revenue growth coupled with expense control and good progress against our strategic priorities drove significant positive fee operating leverage on an operatingbasis we increased return on equity by  basis points and our earnings per share by  from the first quarter last year our new business traction is solid as we continue to invest in our technology and systems benefiting customers and investors and our pipeline remained strong we continue to see strong trends for asset managers to consolidate providers as a way to create efficiencies and improve information needs recent mandates would support this trend we believe state street has the unique advantage of being able to service complex and global assets on an integrated service platform this coupled with our investment in technology and digitizing our processes enables us to extract meaningful data and insights for our clients that they would be hardpressed to obtain anywhere else we see two other secular growth trends that play to our strengths the shift towards passive investing is increasing business given our  plus share of etf servicing and the expansion of international asset managers with multijurisdictional offshore funds is buoying our international growth given our global capabilities these advantages are illustrated by our  increase in assets under custody and administration versus the first quarter of  reflecting strengthening markets improved client flows and the contribution of our new business wins over the past year as eric will lay out for you in more detail based on the strong start to  our outlook has improved modestly from our january  outlook and remains within our previously disclosed ranges turning to slide number four ill now review our progress on our strategic priorities and some key achievements this year we continue to drive growth from our core franchise with new asset servicing wins of approximately  billion for the quarter reflecting mandates from clients around the world in our total new business yet to be installed at quarterend was approximately  billion which is above typical levels over the past two years we also saw continued momentum in ssgas etfs driven by flows and improving equity markets state street beacon continues to progress with further investments and adoption of our technologies were also engaging with our clients to cocreate and prototype solutions to meet their needs examples include some of our key clients global adoption of accounting technologies enabling a  to minute improvement in the endofday delivery of net asset valuations to clients distributors we also continue to make investments in innovative solutions to address client needs across regulatory requirements risk and analytics some examples include our solutions to meet the sec modernization reporting and liquidity risk management rules our datagx solution that provides tools and analytics on client and thirdparty data continues to gain traction from asset owners globally to support their evolving needs we launched the distribution of the gx private equity index to approximately  global asset management clients to enable them to improve benchmark analysis of private equity performance were developing and launching new analytical tools to enable clients to better manage environmental social and governance exposures as these investment strategies continue to gain traction and importance and lastly as we showed at an investor conference in february we have launched a pilot mobile app for chief risk officers to manage their exposures realtime now let me talk about ssga ssga finished the quarter with  trillion in assets under management a  increase from fourth quarter  and a  increase from q  the majority of the growth from q  was driven by market appreciation with an additional  of growth in the acquired ge asset management business which is performing very well ssga achieved strong revenue gains during the quarter driven in part by the momentum of our etf strategies which are benefiting from investments in distribution and product development such as the ssga she etf launched last year to help increase visibility of the importance of gender diversity across corporate boards and management and were delighted by the overwhelming response to fearless girl which demonstrates the power of fulfilling this objective we continue to make good progress in the integration of the acquired ge asset management business notably for the first nine months weve achieved accretive operatingbasis earnings in closing we remain committed to expense control as reflected by our q  positive fee operating leverage of approximately  basis points and total operating leverage of approximately  basis points from q  and in q  through share repurchase and common share dividends we returned approximately  million of capital to common shareholders which was  million ahead of schedule now ill turn the call over to eric aboaf who moved into the cfo role at the end of february eric will review our financial performance for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of  after which well take your questions eric eric w aboaf  state street corp thank you jay and good morning everyone please turn to slide  where ill start my review of our first quarter  operatingbasis results which supplement our gaap results as you can see we have made a conscious effort this quarter to narrow the differences operatingbasis eps for q  increased to  per share up  from q  reflecting higher equity markets new business wins continued expense discipline and fewer shares outstanding q  results reflect strong fee revenue growth over q  in both asset servicing and asset management at the same time we carefully managed the expenses with the help of state street beacon delivering over a  percentage points of positive fee operating leverage over q  this includes  percentage points from the sale of bfdsifds and the ge asset management acquisition slide  also highlights a few notable items that impacted both gaap and operatingbasis results this quarter first we recorded an aftertax gain related to the sale of bfdsifds of  million or  per share as we continue to focus increasingly on our core business second we took the opportunity to tactically reposition a portion of the investment portfolio for the current rate environment which will improve nii going forward that cost  million aftertax or  per share third our first quarter results in both  and  included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive compensation for retirementeligible employees allinall pretax margin was up  percentage points and roe was up  percentage points to  as compared to q  now let me turn to slide  to briefly review growth of two key drivers of our businesses auca increased  from q  driven by market appreciation higher inflows in the us from asset managers and etfs partially offset by the continued rotation out of hedge funds notably we also experienced strong growth in europe relating to both onshore and offshore markets as compared to q  auca also saw a good stepup which positions us well for the rest of the year turning to state street global advisors aum increased  from q  driven by market appreciation and the impact of the acquired ge asset management operations partially offset by some net outflows we did see strong etf inflows again but we continued to expand our products array please turn to slide  where ill review q  revenue compared to q  youll also find detail in the appendix with a comparison to q  servicing fees increased  primarily due to higher equity markets and strong growth in net new business across the globe and across multiple client segments partially offset by continued hedge fund outflows as compared to q  we saw this momentum continuing management fees increased  driven by the contribution of the acquired ge asset management business higher equity markets and higher yielding etf inflows as compared to q  performance was strong as well trading services increased slightly relative to q  as a result of higher volumes in foreign exchange trading securities finance revenue decreased slightly from q  reflecting lower shortinterest in equity markets during the quarter processing fees and other revenue increased primarily due to the bfds sale and the absence of some fx swap costs please note that these fx swap costs are now in net interest income this quarter as they qualified for hedge accounting moving to slide  nim was up  basis points from q  nii increased primarily reflecting higher market interest rates in the us and disciplined liability pricing partially offset by lower interestearning asset and lower nondollar investment portfolio yields as compared to q  nim was up  basis points also due to higher rates and disciplined liability pricing even after considering the additional fx swap costs now in interest expense now ill turn to slide  to review expenses q  expenses increased  in total from q  but half or  of that came from  million of ge asset management expenses compensation employee benefits is impacted in the first quarter of each year by seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirementeligible employees compared to q  the seasonal impact increased by  million driven by a higher number of employees who fell within the retirement age window aside from this increase we saw expected headwinds like annual merit increases new business onboarding costs and technology investments which were offset by savings from state street beacon as compared to q  expenses were up only slightly excluding this q  seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and the q  acceleration of deferred cash awards let me now move to slide  to review our progress on state street beacon beacon remains on track to achieve  million in targeted program savings including at least  million in  but beacon is also designed to enhance client solutions reduce operational risk and engage our teams throughout the enterprise as jay mentioned we are striving towards a highly digitized environment which has already been delivering tangible client benefits notably beacon is now driving innovation such as our recently launched sec modernization products which we expect can contribute to our top line revenue growth in the future were also mitigating risk and gaining efficiencies by automating controls and improving monitoring technology and lastly our beacon program is now addressing opportunities across our enterprise our ssga beacon effort is focused on client experience frontoffice optimization and operational effectiveness and we are tackling our corporate function costs as well now lets turn to slide  to review our balance sheet and capital position we continue to maintain a highquality balance sheet including an investment portfolio with a wellconstructed and diversified mix of securities as i mentioned earlier during q  we had the opportunities to make some tactical adjustments given market trends on the capital front our position remains strong and it remains a key priority to return capital through share repurchases and dividends we retired  million of common stock this quarter which includes our quarterly plan plus consideration received as part of the bfdsifds sale we have  million remaining under our june  common stock purchase program as expected our supplementary leverage ratio increased as we tighten the size of our balance sheet moving to slide  ill update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook with a strong start to  in hand we remain focused on achieving our  outlook which has improved modestly from our january projection our priorities continue to be driving top line growth in our core franchise by delivering solutions to our clients prudently managing expenses as we execute on state street beacon and returning capital to shareholders there are three areas that i would like to highlight in the outlook first we now expect our  operatingbasis fee revenue to be at the middle to higher end of the  to  growth range assuming the favorable market conditions continue to prevail second our nii outlook now assumes a rising rate scenario which anticipates that the fed increases again in september we now expect full year  operatingbasis nii to be at the upper end of our original  billion to  billion range that said we are carefully watching long rates and third we now expect our operatingbasis tax rate to be at the lower end of the  to  target we communicated in january let me briefly touch on the second quarter of  before turning the call back to jay we expect momentum in servicing fees to continue in q  driven by client flows and net new business we expect trading services activity to continue to be muted while expecting a seasonal uptick in securities finance neither the bfds gain in fees nor the securities repositioning are expected to repeat nim should be up in the mid singledigits with the balance sheet down slightly resulting in an increase in nii of several percent in summary we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve our full year  financial objectives now let me turn the call back to jay joseph l hooley  state street corp thanks eric our longterm growth is being fueled by state street beacon and the way ahead and after  years we can step back and see what has made us successful its been our people technology insights and experience combining to create enhanced asset intelligence for our clients our future success will be driven by these strengths and our ability to further differentiate ourselves by transforming the way data is utilized to provide additional capabilities to our global client base now hope id like to open the call to investor questions questionandanswer session operator certainly your first question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin  jefferies llc thanks good morning guys i wanted to see if you could help us understand some of that push and pull between nii and the processing other eric you didnt mention it in your forward commentary so can you just walk us through does that elevated processing and other result ex the  million gain now stay and then we see the direction change in nii or maybe you could just help us through understand that dynamic and what happens from here thanks eric w aboaf  state street corp sure ken its eric let me just take you through it so that youve got a good visibility i think what youve seen us do this quarter as we designated the bulk of the fx swap activity that weve been doing for a number of quarters and years as economic hedges against the deposits and as a result those fx swap costs now sit in nii as opposed to in processing fees i think thats a kind of – its a natural way to report our nii and nim and our expectation is well continue to do that going forward and reflect them along those lines i think if youre just looking for the numbers im happy to share those with you on a yearoveryear basis the swing was about  bps on a quarteroverquarter it was about  bps and now i think weve got a good path going forward ken usdin  jefferies llc and just to confirm then how do we think about that processing and other line given – i think you mentioned lower energy credits and thats got some seasonality in it so if we start at  million  is that now where we go from here eric w aboaf  state street corp i think the – you really have to do two things on the processing and other line which always have some volatility in it right one is youve got to take out the bfdsifds gain right and then secondly youve got to remove the  basis points worth of swap costs that was about  million on the science  of our balance sheet and use that as the new baseline i will remind you theres always some volatility in that line plusminus some so just keep an eye on that and look back over the past i think it will give you a bit of an indication ken usdin  jefferies llc okay and if i could just ask one more just on the blackrock you had – jay had mentioned last quarter that hed expected it to start to roll out in the second half can you just update us on timing of that is that still incorporated in your guidance and if its changed at all thanks joseph l hooley  state street corp sure ken this is jay happy to do that the blackrock transition will occur beginning in  not  and is likely to take several quarters to be completed operator your next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr  evercore isi hi how are you joseph l hooley  state street corp good morning glenn schorr  evercore isi question on deposit beta i mean it looks a little higher than what weve seen at some of the other companies im just curious is that just a function of client franchise and how you want to roll or is there anything contractual that goes towards how the higher rates flow through on the liability side eric w aboaf  state street corp glenn its eric let me take that the client beta is you have to actually – you have to look carefully at the average interestearning schedule to decipher this quarter they were in the  to  range which is i think what weve seen towards the start of a rate cycle in the past what we saw a year ago the way to extract them from that average earning schedule is to take a look at the us deposit costs us interestbearing costs you saw those nudge up about  basis points quarteroverquarter right relative to a  basis point hike by the fed if you also look down at the total interestbearing or the nonus interestbearing deposit costs just remember the swap costs affect that line and so therell be some noise there that you just have to account for glenn schorr  evercore isi i got that okay and i guess this is an ongoing question the revenue growth targets are obviously still in the  to  range i think they were maybe  exge but the fees were better its more like  but any way slice it i think fees grow a little less than assets do you think of that as just like thats the world we live in theres some fee compression theres some mix shift and we make it up on volume and give the operating leverage theyll be happy eric w aboaf  state street corp i think there is a fair number of themes you just covered in a short sentence but i think youve got the gist of it i think what youll find is as asset values increase right – they were up asset values yearoveryear against our mix of equity and fixed income and all were up about  for example – youll naturally see just because of the denominator effect the fee rate flowed down so i think thats just part of the dynamic of the math and then thats further impacted by mix i think you are right though if you think about the buildup of revenue growth in an asset servicing business it starts from how much asset appreciation do you expect yearoveryear right and weve got the last    years to look at you think about flows right are you servicing asset managers who are bringing inflows as opposed to seeing net outflows so that matters you then add net new business right are you gaining a point of market share or  points like what the – how effective are you doing that and obviously one of the reasons for that beacon investment and the technology and the sophistication in the global offering we add is to push that in the right direction there is always a little bit of pricing headwind i think there is a little bit of pricing headwind in this business and every business that one operates in but thats got to be made up and then there is foreign exchange swings up and down so those are kind of the – thats the algebra that i think we think about and obviously a number of those we can control and thats how were focused glenn schorr  evercore isi awesome thanks eric appreciate it eric w aboaf  state street corp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken  ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking the questions just wanted to follow up on the question on deposit beta so i appreciate what weve seen here so far how are you feeling though on a goforward basis whats your sense for the gamma on the beta so to speak in other words how should we think about trajectory of beta from here eric w aboaf  state street corp i still remember that you asked about the gamma on beta i think thats the second derivative if i remember properly from my calculus days i think its a fair question betas have been relatively low by past historical standards we saw  to  this quarter we saw about that a year ago though its hard to always calibrate the very first uptick we expect this level again in second quarter right at least within that range given what we see so far i think what happens after that is the broader question – what happens if there is a hike in september what happens with hikes next year – because we all know that betas for past cycles are in the   range and the question is – will those repeat themselves and if so when obviously the environment has changed right the money market fund and offering is weaker than its been before so that could be a positive for banks when you think about betas on the other hand there are always pressures the other way so well see but so far weve seen i think healthy betas and kind of a good balance and we expect that to play out for the next hike or two brennan hawken  ubs securities llc and sorry about the gamma there im certainly – i talk too much to derivative traders i guess so to paraphrase you dont think there is going to be a significant change in the beta albeit maybe a natural ramp is that fair eric w aboaf  state street corp yeah thats fair given what we know today i think thats our current expectation brennan hawken  ubs securities llc terrific terrific thank you very much and then just curious if you could give some color on the outflows with the institutional business what is it that you think is driving that and maybe what adjustments you guys are looking to make to slow that trend and your thoughts on the etf flows versus maybe some of the large competitors that showed really pretty remarkable flow trends on the back of some price reductions joseph l hooley  state street corp yeah let me start that one brennan and ill invite eric to jump in a twoparter  question on the institutional outflows this quarter it kind of continues the trend of mostly passive largely equity a little bit of sovereign wealth but just general repositioning as well as a little bit of currency overlay also affected that institutional outflow so thats a story that is an ongoing story i think probably the better part of the story is the etf flows which were  billion net in the first quarter and were largely made up of sector funds spy which is the sp  and we had good growth from emea and id just remind you a quarter is a quarter but if you look over the past three quarters our net flows were  billion in the first quarter  billion in the fourth quarter and  billion in the third quarter so i think trends are important here and we feel pretty good about the investments that weve made in the etf franchise both in product and distribution and i would suggest that those investments are paying off and were seeing that so we feel pretty good about the etf positioning do you want to add anything eric w aboaf  state street corp yeah brennan id just add that from a financial standpoint the outflows here were in very thin margin passive strategies i think our overall fee rate in ssga is about  basis points or so these were a good bit below those so theres always a bit of question when you have competitive bidding and so forth as you want to keep low fee low margin business and you can imagine we also need to be a little bit disciplined there i think the important news is that the inflows that came in with that etf franchise are above those rates and so in a way we had a revenue uptick and if you want to step back asset under management – assets under management in the business were up  sequentially revenue was up  why because were actually trading up as part of our business expansion here brennan hawken  ubs securities llc perfect thanks for the color operator your next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein  goldman sachs  co hey jay good morning eric good morning a question for you guys – well eric really for you on the balance sheet strategy so the leverage ratio is in a pretty good place now the size of the balance sheet came down quite meaningfully sequentially and i think it kind of jives with your earlier comments that you kind of expect ish percent i think decline for the full year so i guess a should we take that as the balance sheet should be stable from now on and b as you think about any other repositioning or securities remix  that you guys are thinking about on the balance sheet side just between the securities portfolio eric w aboaf  state street corp sure let me start with the balance sheet side i think you did see us bring it down consciously the background there is as you know as a company we began to tackle the size of the balance sheet almost two years ago now i think weve done quite good work there second half last year with some of the large inflows that we had disclosed  on the asset servicing side those came with deposits right and so deposits started to float up it took the size of our balance sheet up and what you saw us do is effectively make sure that we digested those some of those we cap and then under the surface you saw us do some optimization right we rolled down some of our treasury cd portfolio thats down over two quarters by about  billion  billion so were taking out some of the higher cost deposits as we manage and keep the balance sheet tight going forward i think youre right i think its going to be flattish maybe down a little bit maybe flat you never really know with our client inflows and outflows so i want to be careful there but i think were comfortable with the step reduction that we took and going forward it will be a little more on the businessasusual side on the securities portfolio thats exactly right i think we saw an opportunity we moved just a few billion out of our  billion of securities and we feel pretty confident where we are so we dont expect further adjustments in the near future alexander blostein  goldman sachs  co got it and then the second question jay i think this ones for you just on the  billion of new business thats yet to be installed any  fees associated with that or at least kind of how does the fee rate on that book of business yet to be installed compares to your sort of overall blended fee rate on the installed business joseph l hooley  state street corp yes let me pick that one up alex what i can tell you is that it is a little bit elevated and its elevated because the deals that weve been booking the last couple of quarters tend to be meatier more complex deals which you can infer from that higherish fee rates because its back office middle office and therefore the chunkiness causes extended implementation lifecycle so i guess thats what id say about that alexander blostein  goldman sachs  co got it all right thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc great thanks morning folks eric can you just talk about the assumptions that you have for the  to  fee growth in terms of market returns from lets say the end of the first quarter and also fx volatility i think that was still getting pressured here in april eric w aboaf  state street corp yeah i think the assumptions are in line with what we disclosed back in january were expecting several percentage point increase in underlying equity markets i think in line with general economic forecast fx was kind of at the level of where we were in january the only large swing weve seen so far is the british pound so just – but thats a piece not a large piece but obviously a piece of our european revenues so not a large swing there so id sort of summarize as basic economic assumptions that you or we or others would have out there brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then just to focus back on the balance sheet you did mention youre keeping your eye on yield curve flattening can you give us a sense of some sensitivity to your  net interest revenue outlook on that and then also if you can talk about the repurchase strategy that i think helped it looks like to me the repo line was up about  million sequentially im not sure if it was all due to that how recurring do you think that could be and then any premium amortization decline in the quarter as well eric w aboaf  state street corp all right let me just try to take through those – all fair questions the backend sensitivity i think the best way to frame it is we have that interest rate nii disclosure for  basis points updown in our k we also have the ramp but the shock is probably the easiest one to talk through if you remember about  of our interest rate sensitivity is in the dollar book the balance is in europe and then of the dollar book sensitivity impact the overall – about  of our sensitivity is at the frontend about  at the backend of the curve so i think its the frontend rate hikes from the fed that matter the most but i think what you will see is had rates stayed up in the     range in the us and us markets then that would have created a tailwind of nii for most bank portfolios just given where they have been purchased at in the last few years i think without that you wont have a natural tailwind and so you cant count on that and so its not a huge mover but its the kind of thing that we want to keep an eye on as we estimate and give outlooks on nii repurchase strategy – oh the repo the repo line is just the earnings on the repo book some of that – its a pretty typical repo book some of that includes some repos that are designated under fin  with netting all that is i think well laid out in terms of balances and size in our k in the footnotes i think its footnotes   or  you can find them but thats recurring earnings because its effectively a matchbook of repos and reverses and so that line will now as rates have flowed up will tend to recur brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc and then premium amortization eric w aboaf  state street corp premium amortization is not significant at this point in our book i think it was down just slightly but not enough to call out as a movement of nii or nim this quarter brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research james mitchell  the buckingham research group inc hey good morning first question just theres been a lot of chatter on amending the slr perhaps removing some of the denominator central bank cash or other things like that how much – i mean obviously that would free you up to expand your balance sheet in deposits is there a lot of do you think pentup i guess volume out there that you could put on because i would think the incremental profitability with no slr impact could be pretty significant just trying to get a sense of what that deposit opportunity could be if they were to alter the slr joseph l hooley  state street corp jim let me start and then ill let eric quickly jump in i think that i agree with your point which is there is a lot of discussion – even public discussion i thought it was notable that when governor tarullo gave his ending speech a few weeks ago that he spiked out  custody bank excess depositslr issue as something that was probably an unintended consequence so i probably never felt better about the uniform view that excess deposits  leverage ratio was unintended and probably should be corrected over time not sure when it will be corrected in what form whether they exclude the excess deposits or whether they ladder  adjust the leverage ratio but i think the outlook is pretty good from the standpoint of getting some relief to be determined when and in what form eric w aboaf  state street corp yeah and let me – its eric let me just add to the tactical question for the leverage ratio to be adjusted therere obviously a number of different scenarios in which that could happen i mean we dont know if it does get relaxed certainly there is an opportunity to accept more deposits i think theres certainly a lot of liquidity floating around the system both here in the us and in europe obviously the question is at what rate and so wed want to be judicious about that theres also an ability to lighten our preferred level in the capital stack we have call options on most of those tranches and so could adjust there i think what i would point out though is certainly theres a question as to whether the rules get – to get adjusted but also how because remember the leverage ratio it affects us as a bank on an slr basis right under the slr rules but also the spot current leverage ratio impacts us in terms of ccar and the ccar ask so therere kind of two different parts to the leverage ratio that matter and then ill also remind you just to be careful that if leverage is not a binding constraint for a bank then at some point rwa and cet is and so theres a lot of moving parts here that wed have the consider if there are some changes james mitchell  the buckingham research group inc right absolutely thats why i think deposit growth would probably be the better outcome versus cet running up against cet and maybe jay a question on middleoffice outsourcing outlook it seems like your mutual fund clients have faced some pressure do you see those discussions picking up and whats your kind of outlook on the pipeline for that since it is a little bit higher margin joseph l hooley  state street corp yeah jim there is enormous pressure as has become very visible in the last year or so on the traditional longonly fund companies and so theyre doing everything they can to get more efficient and it has created an uptick – a significant uptick in not only deal flow but the complexity of deal flow meaning the middleoffice gosh i would get to at least an half of the mutual fund related activity today thats got a middleoffice component and even probably more interestingly it also has a data component to it so theres datagx which is a fairly new offering for us where we act as the data integrator taking the middleoffice not only the data that we have but data from other custodians that product is surging too so i think its a natural consequence of more downward pressure on the investment management business generally and were in a pretty good place given the product offering and the things that were continuing to do not only to help solve the middleoffice issue but edge our way into the front office with datagx and other analytics products james mitchell  the buckingham research group inc okay so you feel good about the pipeline joseph l hooley  state street corp i do james mitchell  the buckingham research group inc okay great thank you very much operator your next question is from the line of geoffrey elliott with autonomous geoffrey elliott  autonomous research llp hello thank you for taking the question eric you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks efforts to bring gaap and operating earnings closer together and clearly youve made the change around discount accretion but is there anything else youve done there or anything else youre thinking about doing eric w aboaf  state street corp jeff its a good question weve certainly had a history of the disclosures with gaap and operating i think theres some benefit to that right because they provide you a sense for the underlying business especially the big program like beacon their restructuring charges that are important to note i do think though that theres investor interest theres analyst interest and making sure were as simple to understand as possible i met with a number of you down in new york here in boston over the last couple of months and that came through as some of the feedback that i picked up so i think you saw us narrow down the number of lines discount accretion was all of  million and so to kind of call it out as a separate line id rather just tell you how much it is and incorporated in both results just to make all of our work easier so i think you saw us take a step change this quarter i think well continue to reevaluate during the course of the year and obviously yearends are a more natural time to make – to potentially make some more changes but ill be out there listening and seeing if there is some feedback one way or the other and well take it from there geoffrey elliott  autonomous research llp great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley elizabeth lynn graseck  morgan stanley  co llc hi good morning eric w aboaf  state street corp hi betsy joseph l hooley  state street corp good morning elizabeth lynn graseck  morgan stanley  co llc hi a couple of questions one a bit of a tickytacky one just on operating deposits versus nonoperating deposits when were talking about deposit beta highlighting therere some things that are different this time around thats one of them and just wanted to understand how far along you are in shrinking the nonoperating deposits that you have eric w aboaf  state street corp yeah betsy its eric i think part of the optimization that you saw us do over the course of the last quarter is obviously focused on the excess deposits or the nonoperating deposits i think those come in a couple of flavors right some deposits by virtue of coming from financial institutions and there is a very broad definition under the us and basel rules all count as nonoperating i think you saw us a couple years back reduce those amounts and we want to stay in a comfortable zone because those financial institutions hedge funds private equity funds those are our natural clients were servicing and even though those dont count as sticky deposits we may think they should but they dont under the rules we need to accommodate those and well continue to do that so i think weve made some step changes there a yearandahalf ago and are comfortable with the level i think what we find is in the balance of our business what happens is you have deposits and up to a point they count as operating and over that point when they are above the kind of natural flows that you would expect them to cover the rules require you to do some calculations or statistical analysis designate a kind of a level for different types of clients based on their activities and the levels above that tend to be excess those are the ones that weve obviously spent more time trying to calibrate and adjust its not a science but thats what were focused and thats been the effort i think going forward as i said i think the balance sheet size is comfortable where its at wed like to keep it flattish from here im an extreasurer so i always say down a tick just to keep things tight but we like where we are well always do work though under the surface and so we still have a wholesale cd book in the  billion to  billion range if some good client deposits come in i can bring that down that would improve nim because of the interest rate cost differential and youll see us take those kinds of actions if we can elizabeth lynn graseck  morgan stanley  co llc okay thats great eric and then just second thing we talked a little bit about the slr and the cet how do you think about the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio if you didnt have these other constraints to consider what do you think a good range is for running the bank on that measure eric w aboaf  state street corp thats a good question betsy and ive not actually spent a lot of time with that historic measure probably because we have so many measures whether its slr fully phasedin slr we have cet we have tier  we have advanced and standardized and so to be honest my perspective is i expect some refinements on the current capital rules but not so much that we could go back to some of those historic measures like te to ta i think that will just be an outgrowth of what the current rules are to be honest elizabeth lynn graseck  morgan stanley  co llc right got it okay hey thanks a lot eric w aboaf  state street corp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja  jpmorgan securities llc hi eric the first question for you can we talk a little about other operating costs normally they seem to come down a little bit in the first quarter did not see as much of a decline linked quarter in fact year on year and i recognize there is the ge acquisition partly but its up very sharply so could you tell us whats going on with that line and why its running a little higher than it has previously eric w aboaf  state street corp sure other operating expense – and i think other folks on the call can find it on the supplement or the earnings report its up yearonyear really for two reasons one is the ge subadvisory fees actually get booked in that line and that was about – i think about half a third to half of the uptick the other is that there is some regulatory and insurance costs right theres fdic there is some of that equivalent in europe and i think there might even been some of those vat taxes  and so forth that come through on the expense line quarteronquarter what you did see is a reduction the quarteronquarter reduction is down about  and that was professional fees coming down some of that is weve insourced more of regulatory activities so you see that in a different line as an example but that was down sequentially vivek juneja  jpmorgan securities llc so looking forward any color on how we should think about that given that thats clearly running on a yearonyear basis much higher presuming the subadvisory fees are going to  regulatory obviously down from the fourth quarter and same with the insurance eric w aboaf  state street corp yeah i think thats fair i think you can think of that line as flattish – within a range i think theres some volatility weve got some of our regulatory costs but those at least – unless we hear more right from some of the supervisors we expect those to continue and some of those are good runthebank kind of activities so i think relatively flattish going forward vivek juneja  jpmorgan securities llc a question for jay jay there was a comment in the release about hedge fund outflows having some impact can you give us an update on where you stand on that what youre seeing in – since thats obviously an important client base for you folks and youve been a leader in that one joseph l hooley  state street corp sure happy to do that vivek as you know over the past probably  years we have moved into the alternative administration space both hedge private equity and real estate and in fact are a leader in that marketplace and you also are well aware that the hedge fund industry has suffered many sequential quarters of outflows due to performance and other reasons and so we would reflect some of that movement and in the quarter we continue to see outflows in hedge funds and i would just suggest that we hope that turns but were not fully in control of that but id also mention that thats just one dimension of our servicing complex i could also point to a few other things just to provide some balance the longonly business – the traditional longonly business in the us actually looked a little bit better youve seen outflows for a long time that kind of went to neutral in the past quarter which we view as constructive and then just to give you a couple of other dimensions outside of the us the offshore markets continue to run very fast and were the market leader in the offshore services most of which are centered in luxembourg and dublin and then just final point to that just to give you kind of the highlights of the big movers as money has moved out of hedge funds weve seen it flow into private equity and real estate and so weve seen our private equity administration business pick up and even real estate more recently as the complexity of doing backoffice for real estate assets is overwhelming some of the asset managers so i would say i wouldnt focus overtly on just hedge funds i think its always a portfolio where some things are in favor some things are out of favor and id say for now hedge funds continue to look to be out of favor which reflects on our – that component of our servicing fees vivek juneja  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and where are you on asset management since ge seems to have been well absorbed any color on what youre thinking on that front now and particularly from an acquisition standpoint joseph l hooley  state street corp yeah i would say – my broad comment about asset management is we feel we focused our strategy more in etfs and solutions and weve been making investments and i think the performance that youve seen this quarter and the last couple quarters is a reflection of that so we feel good about the space that weve decided to compete in and the ge asset management acquisition has exceeded expectations from a standpoint of getting everybody onboard and even having a little bit of – its early days but some uptick in new business its given us much more variety in our asset classes in order to fulfill our solutions business and from an acquisition standpoint vivek i would say theres probably some gaps smaller gaps in our asset offering that if we could fill them with a team or a small acquisition we would entertain but nothing more significant than that vivek juneja  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks jay operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets steven duong  rbc capital markets llc hi this is actually steve duong in for gerards team thanks for taking our questions just regarding the blackrock business that is being transferred to jpmorgan are there any deposits with that business and if so how much is going joseph l hooley  state street corp yeah – go ahead eric w aboaf  state street corp steve its eric theres a bit of deposits with every client that we have and well certainly factor that in and thats factored in our view of this year and next year i will say though there are more deposits that tend to come our way than go our treasurer and our businesses do quite a bit of balancing between price and just active discussions with our servicing counterparties about how much they can leave with us and so if a little deposits flow out let me tell you therell be other clients who want to leave deposits with us in a pretty simple exchange steven duong  rbc capital markets llc understood thank you and just a second question regarding your dividend what are you guys thinking about just as far as a longterm dividend payout is something like a  fair eric w aboaf  state street corp steve its eric i think thats a good question and id kind of answer it in two ways i think were comfortable with the current level of dividends versus buyback it gives us a good amount of flexibility in terms of the capital structure we like the opportunity to have the mix that we have and obviously thats all part of our ccar ask that we submitted back in april i think id also say that as said has  become clear that there isnt really a  dividend cap as a way to return capital to shareholders well consider over time whether we want to make some adjustments but that will be something we consider but no no new news to report at this point steven duong  rbc capital markets llc great thanks for taking our questions eric w aboaf  state street corp yes operator your final question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl  keefe bruyette  woods inc yeah thanks so just two quick questions really you did mention on the new business yet to be installed that was coming in with higher fee rates than what you currently see across the company is that also the same for the blackrock business thats going away is that a higher fee rate business as well joseph l hooley  state street corp yeah let me just clarify that brian what i described is that its a higher – the  billion is a higher level of backlog to be installed than we have traditionally had and connected to that i mentioned that the reason for that is that theyre bigger meatier more complex deals therefore they have a longer implementation timeframe you can infer from that that theres more middleoffice and complexity and so a higher fee rate the blackrock business is kind of standard kind of  actish straightforward common trust fund business so a little simpler brian kleinhanzl  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay and then was there any impact from the run rates from the sale of the bfds business eric w aboaf  state street corp there was not in this quarter its eric brian theres not in this quarter just because it was done at the end of the quarter therell be a small one but its fairly minor in the scheme of our revenues and certainly incorporated in our fee and revenue guidance that weve provided brian kleinhanzl  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay great thanks operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing remarks joseph l hooley  state street corp thanks hope and i just want to thank everybody for their participation today and we look forward to speaking with you in july with the second quarter results thank you operator thank you this does conclude todays
