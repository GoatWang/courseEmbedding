review   sw deckscapes review sherwin williams deckscapes advanced waterborne transparent stain offers  way uv protection for wood by absorbing blocking and stabilizing the wood fibers deskscapes enhances the natural wood grain while preventing mold and mildew note we used sw’s deckscapes in their waterbased toner formula for our test and review sherwin williams deckscapes stain scores  appearance after initial stain application  – sherwin williams deckscapes is a water based acrylic formula that created a film on top of the wood after drying the overall appearance of the redwood color was poor and the stain dried unevenly even though it was applied properly preventing uv graying at  year mark  – after  years the sherwin williams deckscapes lost about  of its original color weartear and peeling  – the sherwin williams deckscapes did not hold up well on our full sun test deck after the second winter about  of the stain had peeled from the floor this did not happen in just the high traffic areas but throughout the entire deck cost per square foot  – we used  gallons of stain for our  foot test deck  coats of the sherwin williams deckscapes was applied the cost to stain was around  a foot preventing moldmildewalgae  – the deckscapes tested very well on preventing mold and mildew no mold was growing in or on top of the stain very small amounts of mold were visible in the wood where the stain had peeled ease of application  – this stain is not easy to apply we found that the deckscapes dried incredibly fast this made it very difficult to apply the stain as we worried about overlaps we used a brush and roller with the application and found that the stain did not apply anywhere near the manufacturer coverage rates we found that the sherwin williams deckscapes closer to  feet per gallon color shifting darkening after  years  – sherwin williams deckscapes does not darken in color but fades and peels ease of reapplication  – reapplication of the deckscapes would not be easy since the stain had peeled badly you would need to use a heavy stain stripper followed by sanding to remove the stain from the rest of the deck a light cleaning and recoat would not work overall score defy extreme stain at  year period  – we were very disappointed in the sherwin williams deckscapes having used sw paints in the past with excellent results we expected better for their exterior decking stain the deckscapes does not apply very well has a poor appearance when finished and peels buyer beware product information where to buy sherwin williams cost  per

these issues occur with wood that has retained too much moisture prior to staining i live in michigan with harsh winters and the stain did not start to wear down until  years i had exposed wood in a few areas and faded color…but no peeling after  years i think this is normal wear and tear not a product defect reply month  days agodarreni literally just finished my deck with sherwin williams stain and ran into all the same issues had a nice wood deck and now i have a brown painted deck very unhappy with the product wish i had found this review prior to using it it looked horrible after one coat and had to use two on everything i did waste of money time and effort cannot wait until it starts peeling in  year reply month  days agolarrypealed after  yearof application had to use almost twice as much to cover my deck and this is not a stain it’s a deck paint……now i am stuck with a painted deck don’t waste your money reply month  days agostudont go near this stuff scuffing and peeling off after  months i did everything as instructed including deck wash before staining does not penetrate the wood at all reply months  hours agomcsi have a large deck approx  square feet that has been stained with multiple coats of sherwin williams deckscapes solid waterborne stain the horizontal surfaces are stained gray and are bubbling and peeling sherwin williams has discontinued their deckscapes product and replaced it with the superdeck product what is the best way to remove the layers of old stain so i can put a fresh coat of stain on the wood do you recommend the superdeck product i expect that i will need to stay with a solid stain in a dark color thank you reply months  hours agodeck stain helpthe only way to remove multiple layers of a solid stain is to sand it all off if going with another solid stain there is no reason to sand it all off just pressure wash to remove any “loose” stain leaving the stain that is intact apply the new coating over top of this reply months  hours agomcsso you recommend sanding off the loose stain then pressure washing to remove any loose remnants for a pressure treated deck with  ″ wide boards do you recommend a floor drum sander or a random orbital floor sander thank you reply months  hours agodeck stain helpjust pressure wash is needed reply months  hours agomcsi have already pressure washed and i keep finding more sections that lift off please see the attached photos they are all of the same area with a little bit of lifting of loose stain power washing just seems to drive more water under the stain causing it to bubble up further …not wanting to make this a lifelong endeavor… i appreciate your experienced insights mcs reply months  hours agodeck stain helpunfortunately you have an issue all that solid stain is not attached to the wood and it needs to come off sanding as you mentioned will be required use a drum sander for the floors and a belt or orbital for the verticals reply months  hours agokathhow about updating your research give me a break  reply months  days agodeck stain helphmm no reason to be rude this product label is discontinued and relabeled under the sw super deck name which by the way has been updated thanks reply months  day agotjswe used this product on a new deck that we let weather for one year one year after applying the stain the full sun floor had  peeling now after  years almost  peeled don’t know what to do will be a lot of work to sand or remove unpeeled stain reply months  days agod pappaswe also used this product last year on our deck this spring almost all the stain has come off the stairs the rails which should look like new have also started to chip we are trying to find a product that will do what it says it will do does anyone know of such a product reply months  days agodeck stain helpyou will need to remove the sw before swiching brands see here for our suggestions on the stain the  best deck stain reviews and ratings reply months  days agodangi’m looking for feedback on sherwin williams reformulated superdeck waterborne semitransparent stain the  deckstainhelp review for superdeck states “the current sherwin labels super deck that is water based would be comparable to our review of the sherwin williams deckscapes” but it is not clear if any of these reviews reflect the new  product reformulation for the superdeck waterborne semitransparent stain reply months  days agodeck stain helpdoes not say what the so called “enhancements” actually are in the article meaning what did they do or add to make it better they just talk about improving it reply months  days agorosehelp  the sherwin williams deckscape treated deck began to peal almost immediately after the university painters sara williams of fairfax va manager completed the job i reported this to them and their manager sara williams came and saw all the pealing i have asked repeatedly for this to be fixed all my friends and neighbors are shocked at how bad the deck looks the deck looked way better before your product was applied how can my deck be restored to its former beautiful self thanks reply months  days agomarilyni used sw deck scapes and it peeled after  years before that i used the olympic stains that product lasted  up years i should have stayed with olympic stains in my opinion olympic stains are a better product reply months  days agodonna burnsbuyer beware after a few years our deck is peeling not supposed to peel it is now needing to be stripped and will require a great amount of time and hard work to get it looking good again reply months  days agodeborah macwe put this on our pool deck and stairs and shed platform last year we used hawthorne semisolid with the cost and following all prep instructions and application instructions i am so very disappointed the deck is spotted and already chipping and peeling it also has a white haze on all surfaces painted i would never recommend this product to anyone to use i read reviews and asked questions before choosing it…today i realize i made a huge expensive mistake i questioned the need to seal it after application and was told i didnt need to something sure went wrong reply months  days agojeanthis stain did not even last to the next year i had to wait due ti expense until two years had to have someone out again to prepare wood for stain but due to cost stained it myself would not recomend this product reply months  hours agok mageri painted  coats originally over older stain on deck approximately  years old in  exactly as required first year paint was bubbling up in spots scraped the bubbles and went right down to bare wood each year keep scraping bubbles and paint just peels off it appears to be wet underneath shoveled the snow off in winter with plastic shovel thought this could help now there are spots that are starting to rot the wood where chairs are attached to deck will have to replace the deck as it is peeling worse as time goes on i have sanded the areas and painted each year pressure washing is a night mare as lifts up some but not all not a good product sorry i ever used it thought i could get the very best product at sherwin williams but not so reply months  days agotraceim a finish carpenter i mostly do casework cabinetry and furniture but still take on rough and outdoor jobs at times i tested and used each of the versions transparent semitransparent and solid of this stain in two different colors recently applied with a brush the transparent and semitransparent appeared very light – like a colored wash on aged wood the color was all but lost rolled on both versions looked horrible spraying produced the most even coverage but the transparency of the product was lost the solid version applied with a brush was noticeably better but still had an inconsistent appearance when dry a second coat also yielded subpar results in both application and appearance my best results came by spraying on the solid color however the finished product looked painted rather than stained this may be okay for a pine deck but if the deck was of something more exotic id go back to an untinted transparent sealant rather than taking a chance with this stuff the only time it impressed me was how easily it cleaned up as for peeling it is almost always preventable by properly preparing the surface before applying ive preferred sw paints for over  years but will go back to cabot or sikkens for my future outdoor staining projects reply months  days agomaryclairehi i have a composite deck correctdeck its made out of  wood fiber and  polypropylene would you let me know what cabot or sikkens product you liked best thanks reply months  days agokathryn rhinehartafter applying this product in  it started peeling put another coat on the following year it again peeled now  it hasnt completely peeled off however im now researching different ways to resolve this problem one chemically remove remaining deckscape finish and cover with something compatible or flip the deck boards and start over again flipping the decking seems easiest next ill have to research the market to learn what is a worthy finish for my deck any suggestions reply months  days agodeck stain helpyou have to remove it all if you do not flip flipping is harder than you think and sometimes shows water stains where the joists touched the wood and they may not come out after you flip or remove use a penetrating semitrans stain like twp reply months  days agojancontinuously peels off in spots – i must scrape  repaint every year there must be something better than this out there reply months  days agocarlaterrible stain peels cracks i now will have to have deck professionally sanded and start over of course with a different product no more sherwin williams reply year  days agolindaits only been about  months and my redwood deck is already looking bleached out i have to resand it and find another product very disappointed in this product reply year  month agojay watsonwill never use again does not hold up  of deck peeling after  months reply year  months agocynthia cornwellafter less than  year entire deck was peeling stain was applied by a professional hoping that there is some sort of refund on this product… reply year  months agosuzanne silvahorrible horrible wear so sorry we used it sherman williams says it its wonderful buy them after they will say its wont last reply year  months agojo daughertystain is peeling down to the bare wood even in low traffic areas peeling started at the end of year one i too thought i could rely on a sherwin williams product not so reply year  months agojimabsolute rubbishsherwin is a good product been using it now for  yrsif it peels it may not have been applied properly the temperature plays a big part in the finishharsh winter conditions can wear down the horizontal surfaces obviouslyi know this im a professional deck restorergreat solid and semi stainsgreat pigment not all colours are so greatbut the ones i tecomend are nd to nonea bad tradesman blames his tools if you know wat your doing there should rarely be a problem reply year  months agochristerrible product does not last only one year old and needs to be redone when i used olympic stain lasted  years in the hot texas sun do north use this product unless you only want it to last a year what a waste of time and money reply year  months agocartronwhich olympic stain did you use reply year  months agoanthony whismani applied this product to a deck sept  it looks like it did when i started it did not last but a year reply year  months agoshawn gwaltneyreview of sherwin williams deckscape is exactly as my results were with professional application…very disappointing reply year  months agosue mi have a front porch that we built with composite decking it is approximately  years old it is very faded and warped i would like to paint or stain it but after reading all of the horrible reviews for the sherwin williams and behr deck stains i am hesitant to use any of these or similar products how do you think a regular porch paint would work or do you think its the nature of the composite material reply year  months agodeck stain helpnot sure on this never painted a composite before we have stain a composite many years ago a few times that was with the messmers composite stain it looked pretty good reply year  months agojoe mcchristiani used sherman williams deck stain on a project it was the water based i have had nothing but a headache my customer noticed it was staining were ever water sat on it also it was still soft to the touch two days after application sherman williams said that it was particular leaching and it would be okay in a few days that was a week ago its not looking okay reply year  months agocarole ewith deckscapes being sherwin williams new improved product for exterior use i had high hopes for improvement applied at the start of summer and in the areas where the deck has the most amount of sun exposure paintstain started bubbling up by august the issue was so widespread and noticeable i once again started scraping the boards which were dry underneath and found that removing this product was so simply – it came up in sheets some pieces of the peeled paint were  long and when i say this product came up in sheets all it took was scraping one end and i could pull off the rest with little or no effort its like having a winter coat and unzipping to remove so very disappointed in the wearability durability and cost of this product sw needs to go back to their original product and leave this one by the wayside reply year  months agodougthis stuff wasnt cheap cost wise but it ruined our deck after a year pealing cant clean it to reapply garbage sherwin williams should make this right somehow  reply year  months agomary ti hate this new product sherwin williams short changed their deck customers when they completely changed the product and the colors with no cross reference as to what to buy for your pervious applications i used cedar for  years and my deck always looked brand new when i redid it i was sold a redwood when i took in a sample of what i had been using they insisted it would match because i only wanted to do the deck floor well it is way too red and when it drys one the deck it is many different colors depending on how much sun it got over the years under the awing it is not covering the cedar and it looks bad all those hours of labor and expense for what looks like a really bad job i am  and still do my own painting of the deck and this is the first time i have been totally unhappy with the results would not recommend this product to anyone wish i would have gone to lowes or somewhere else to buy a product that would have been worth all of my labor never thought to look at comments before i tried it just spend another two hours trying to do a second coat and i sitll will have about  different shades on my deck who in the  at sherwin williams decided this was to be a better product than the one i was totally happy with for  years gee would sherwin williams send someone over to redo it for me i just am too tired to even finish it right now reply year  months agopaulathis product went on fairly easy and dried extremely fast once dried color was streaky and uneven we followed all instructions after the first winter over  of the finish was gone even on the vertical surfaces would not recommend to anyone reply year  months agosandracleaned fence property of mold and mildew with power wash spayed on dry fence however live in south florida and now reading that this should not be applied in sun thought sherwin williams would have told us that second coat uneven inconsistent shading allot of dripping that unfortunately the painter missed as well nightmare after two coats and  reply years  days agolaimathe stain started peeling before it was even  year old if you spray off the deck it just peels off the painters had to restain it with a different product horrible product we will never use this companys paint or stain again our painters recommended it what a mistake and waste of a lot of money reply years  days agomikescapethe key is in prepping the surface once you have removed all loose prior stain it lasts a few years mine is starting to show wear after  years reply years  months agoowen morgani stained my house using this stain and in two years it was covered with mold on the north and east sides prior to that it had olympic stain for over twenty years with no mold reply years  months agoandrewas a professional painteri personally use the deckscapes oil based natural toneri operate on the east coast beachall of the results are on how you prepi power wash all wood to the original new condition after you achieve thatapply the oil generously at least  years reply years  months agosheilasorry buddy but we power washed our new deck and did everything we were suppose to last year and it looks like crap this year will never use deckscapes again reply years  month agokenthis by far is the worst deck stain i have ever used if you are looking at this product put it down and run from it as fast as you can reply years  months agocaroli have put it on twice in one year and looks horrible after a few months going to try something else for sure reply years  months agocmbugh this is why i have waited  years to stain  paint the deck nothing is consistent we pressure washed it last weekend i have been painting the railings and was getting ready to paint the floor with the deckscapes semitransparent in chestnut the duration white i have been using on the railings was okay but the damn green whatever it is algae in the wood keeps seeping through the paint i even used a coat of kilz on it all before hand… oy home ownership is overrated reply years  months agojenniferwe bought the deck scapes toner in natural  years ago i go in in last week buy another  gallon on the natural toner thinking nothing of it i take it home open it  and it doesnt look like the same color take it back in  and they proceed to tell me that since ive bought it they have reformulated it due to government regulations proceed to tell me that this toner named natural is the closest replacement color my question is why would they keep the same name…when its not the same color very misleading we are now having a hard time matching another color to what we have already restaindwe had some old left over that we used    which now has been reformulated any suggestions reply years  months agodeck stain helpstrip off the current stain and switch to a different brand that is oil based with a similar color reply years  months agodennissome of the comments on here are really off base i am a manager at a sherwin williams store the rule of thumb with any semitransparent stain is that it will last  years tops due to sunlight solid stains will last  years if you want the grain to show through then you need to restain every  years as far as chipping and peeling goes prep work is vital make sure you strip any existing stain powerwash and ensure the surface is clean dry and dull prior to staining dennis reply years  days agosusani just bought solid stain to cover my deck power washed all of it floor came out great  spindles still are holding some of the remainder of the flood stain i used last year please tell me i dont have to put remover on it and power wash all my spindles  reply years  days agodeck stain helpyou do not have to remove all previous stain when applying a new coat of a solid stain make sure that you remove all that is loose reply years  days agodawnused and wont purchase again it doesnt hold up have you actually used it reply years  days agoowen morgani had olympic stain for twenty years and it still looked good reply years  months agoed bdennis you are right on i am not a professional but i have done many of my own decks no matter what transparent you use and i have used the supposed best the sun will destroy them and you have to redo every  yrs i have been using the sherwin williams deckscape solid water bourn the best i have ever used and will not use any other i am going on my third yr no peeling no mold some color fading but great i think some of the people who have comment whether a professional or not have not prepped properly or as one mentioned they applied in direct sunlight or high temps the skin of the stain drys too fast not allowing for the vehicle to bleed off and properly dry by the way i live in nw michigan deck faces directly south lot of sun and about  of snow on it last year with  below zero any one in my area is welcome to come and see ed reply years  months agocarol speeled and blistered in less than a year on all flat surfaces and i have the same weather conditions as ed b would not let the people who guaranteed the job reapply the same product reply years  days agollltimelllhave you tried wood rx ultra if so whad you think reply years  months agoclatyonwe have used this product several times as we are a professional painting company  it works great if the surface is properly prepped typical reasons why paint is peeling etc your newly installed deckfence is pressure treated and must be left to dry outweather for  year you have recently had a new deckfence installed  its not pressure treated so you go ahead  paint it but new lumber needs to weather for approxmately  months…we prefer to let it weather for  months your deckfence that has been weathering for years and you decide its time to seal it with stain but you didnt do the following treat it with deckwash then pressure wash to remove all the dirt dust  grease that has accumulated over the past few years you decided to use a high grit palm sander to open up the woodgrain on your new deck so you could stain now instead of waiting for it to weather but after sanding you didnt give it an extremely good rinse to remove the dust wood was to damp you applied in direct sun high heat…stain wont properly bond to the surface if it dries instantly… ottawa if you have any questions or concerns about your project please let us know as we are more than happy to offer our advice reply years  days agoirenehello clayton we have just finished sanding and scraping x which i spent a month  years ago prepping and applying to our  year old red cedar deck following the instructions to the letter other than over the joist the wood was fine i put nailers in and replaced the rotten or soft areas i want to be sure we dont make another mistake whatever we put on next has to last we are both seniors and it is no small project for me to do projects like this i am totally confused about what to use that will cover the pieces and stay on the surface what do you suggest i have found the names of sw arborcoat solid body acrylic stain solid hide deckscape and gulf synthetics deck revive by gemini coatings i would so appreciate any input you might have i need to get this done before our guests start arriving thank you for your attention irene —– reply year  days agodeck stain helpgulf deck revive but you must use their permabond reply year  days agojim mi aplied sw deckscapes stain on a newly installed treated wood deck first coat looked ok but after a week or so it started to show sploches so  week later i applied a heavy second coat and after  weeks the stain has not thourly dried there are area that can be peeled off with a putty knife what can i do to fix this reply years  months agodeck stain helpi do not think you can fix this most likely you will need to remove it all and start over probably will need to sand it off as a stripper will not work sorry reply years  months agomonahi i live in mi constructed a new deck the floors are composite  its  feet above the ground called someone to stain it she primed the rods bout not the railings and put  coat using sw deckscape water based and the painter disappeared i have an enclosed area which i wanted screened now with all the reviews i dont know if i should go ahead and paint it or just let it be for yr will the area that is painted peel off by next yr or do i need to strip it now itself pl advice thanks reply years  months agobethim a painting contractor with  years in the business – and i have used sherwin williams products for many of those years i will stand by most of their products and still do however three years ago i had  deck jobs lined up in early summer and given michigans frequently rainy weather having  dry days to wait for applying oil stains was a scheduling challenge so i used the waterbased deckscapes for most of them the following year i had to completely strip and redo at my cost because i will stand behind my work several decks that had utterly failed luckily my sales rep comped me quite a lot of sherwin williams deck stain remover which works quite well leave it on for longer than recommended but i was still not a happy camper i went back to twp which my sherwin williams store now orders for me  i have never had a call back or complaint about twp i have previously used the oilbased sw deckscapes with no problems it seems that the main issue is poor penetrationadhesion with the waterbased stain especially when applied on a lowtotheground deck with no moisture barrier underneath reply years  month agomonahi beth can you pl reply to my query thanks reply years  months agog wensinkvery disappointed – last october i stained my deck – the wood was old as it had been built several years ago but the staff at sherwin williams told me it would be fine it was a lot of back breaking work as i am a senior but i was happy with the way it looked until this spring as soon as the snow melted i noticed that it was peeling everywhere some areas are bare and others are peeling – mostly down the centre of each board i was advised at the store to just brush the loose flakes off and apply a new even more expensive product over top i was going to try that but it is like a rubbery coating and will not brush off – it just pulls back in strips so i think i will have to try a stripper – as was suggested by a competitive store what a waste of time and money reply years  month agomike pettitapplied the waterborne semitransparent stain very difficult to apply which yielded very poor results any suggestions on how to remove this stain reply years  month agodeck stain helpstrip off what you can with restore a deck stripper and sand the rest off apply brightener when done reply years  month agonancywe decided to use sw semi transparent stain on our deck which is approximately  sq ft two years ago we pressure washed and prepared the deck after one year the main deck and top of the railings started to peel we went to our local store to complain and the manager told us this was normal and gave us one gallon of stain which we did not use i wrote to the company last year and explained the situation telling them that we used sw semi transparent because we wanted a quality product this year our store manager came and did an assessment of the deck he said he would provide more stain no thanks or a full refund we opted for the refund as we are older and i have stage  cancer we were hoping they would offer to strip or pressure wash the deck and railing tops and we would find a compatible color of a different product to redo no such luck we started stripping the deck today with behrs deck stripper which is not very good either and pressure washing it by the time it is finished i will probably be dead i will never use another sw product or visit their establishments again very unsatisfied even with the refund reply years  month agotammy duranhelp i cannot get waterborne stain off my deck sherwin has provided with the two stripping products they offer and nothing is coming off but peeled stain…and we
