directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not

center home » press center » press releases » testimony of under secretary for domestic finance peter r fisher before senate commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs and product safety  testimony of under secretary for domestic finance peter r fisher before senate commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs and product safety  page contentfrom the office of public affairs js hearing promoting corporate responsibility through the elimination of dividend tax chairman fitzgerald ranking member wyden and distinguished members of the subcommittee i am honored to testify before you in support of the president’s proposal to eliminate the double taxation of dividends this proposal would strengthen our economy and create jobs by improving corporate governance and retargeting investment to its most productive ventures  corporate governance would improve because the proposal would better align executives’ interests with shareholders’ and encourage companies to disclose more clearly their cash earnings and taxes paid  investment efficiency would rise because the proposal would reduce tax distortions to fundamental corporate decisions such as whether to repay shareholders or how much debt to raise  the result would be more investment higher productivity more new jobs and faster economic growth  at a time when too many people who want jobs can’t find them and when economic growth around the world is slower than we should accept the president’s proposal would be a welcome shot in the arm in the past year under chairman oxley’s and senator sarbanes’ leadership congress took a major step toward improving corporate governance in america  investors have matched that with their own call for improved governance  corporate executives directors auditors and lawyers are already hearing and heeding the call for greater accountability  betterrun corporations make for more efficient capital markets and a healthier economy but there is more to be done in encouraging the best conduct from corporate executives  think of the headlines of the past couple years  jobs destroyed by bankrupt firms that took on too much debt  executives that “managed” earnings inflating their companies’ stock prices and pumping up the value of their own stock options  “corporate inversions” where companies moved to tax havens abroad there are many forces responsible for these problems but our tax code shares some of the blame  by taxing dividends twice our tax code encourages companies to retain earnings instead of paying them to shareholders to raise excessive levels of debt to repurchase shares often on a oneoff basis instead of issuing dividend checks to dedicate some of america’s leading minds to tax minimization instead of job creation  there’s nothing wrong with debt or retained earnings or share repurchases  but there’s no reason our tax code should favor them either eliminating the double taxation of dividends would reduce these biases against investing and creating jobs  a shareholder would no longer pay a second layer of taxes on dividends if the corporation had already paid tax on that income  if the company retained that income and invested it again the shareholder would get an equivalent credit   this is a ripe moment to improve corporate governance by removing the tax bias toward debt and retained earnings  ceos and capital markets are now acutely sensitive to the risks of managed earnings  yet today because of double taxation only half of nonfinancial firms pay dividends  without periodic dividends – unmistakable facts about cash flow – investors are basically left with earnings opinions  as secretary snow says you can fudge earnings but you can’t fudge cash  the president’s proposal would clear the barriers to companies that sought to mirror their earnings reports with dividend checks the president’s proposal is bad news too for the attractiveness of corporate tax shelters corporate inversions and other tax minimization devices  the rationale for creating these devices would lessen because an investor could only claim an exclusion on a dollar of dividends if the company had paid full tax on that dollar the proposal’s second benefit would be boosting investment efficiency and thus job creation  let’s be clear where jobs come from  new jobs come from investment – the willingness of investors and entrepreneurs to put capital at risk in a business venture  the president’s proposal is focused precisely on that point at sharpening the incentives for investors and entrepreneurs to invest in the most productive ventures  and higher productivity means higher wages and a stronger economy for everyone taxing dividends twice means that we tax investment more heavily than any other major industrial nation  if investment is the blood of new jobs and growth this is bad policy the double taxation of dividends also distorts companies’ decision to retain funds versus returning capital to shareholders  even if shareholders have more promising investment opportunities elsewhere the tax code locks those funds up inside the company  that’s not good for shareholders and it’s certainly not good for the economy each year american firms invest over  trillion in fresh capital and generate  billion in corporate profits  think of the gains in capital utilization and job creation for everyone if we accelerate and retarget this entire investment process  the council on economic advisors estimates that through  the dividend tax cut alone would generate more than  new jobs nearly a third of the total from the president’s jobs and growth package  the business roundtable says it’s even higher closer to half   taxing dividends once and only once would convert directly into higher share prices  private sector economists estimate that the president’s proposal could boost stock prices by  to  percent delivering immediate wealth to a confidenceshort market last some ask why the president has not proposed eliminating the corporate income tax instead  the main reason is that doing so would violate the president’s principle that the government tax dividends once and only once  if congress eliminated corporatelevel taxation many billions in profits headed to taxfree entities or abroad would escape any taxation at all  much more revenue would be foregone  and the way would be kept open for the same kind of tax minimization devices that today’s tax code fosters and which the president’s proposal would cut back  on behalf of the administration i urge you to take this opportunity  thank you   the
