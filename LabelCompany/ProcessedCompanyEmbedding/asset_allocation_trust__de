of the trusts shareholders for more information regarding the trust and its holdings please see the trusts most recent prospectus and annual report security valuation investments in the underlying openend mutual funds are valued at the net asset value per share as reported by the underlying funds as of the close of the regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day the exchange is open for trading securities are valued by brokers which use prices provided by market markers or estimates of market value obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics debt securities of sufficient credit quality with original maturities of  days or less generally are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value the amortized cost method involves valuing a security at its cost plus accretion of discount or minus amortization of premium over the period until maturity investments in openend mutual funds and nonregistered investment companies are generally valued at net asset value the valuation techniques used by the trust to measure fair value are consistent with the market approach income approach andor cost approach where applicable for each security type fair valuation measurements fair value measurements of investments are determined within a framework that has established a fair value hierarchy based upon the various data inputs utilized in determining the value of the funds investments the threelevel hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the trusts investments are classified within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the inputs are summarized into three broad levels as follows   level     quoted prices in active markets for identical securities     level     other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc     level     significant unobservable inputs including the funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
