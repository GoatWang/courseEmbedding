strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and

fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal

the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms despite the slowdown in onebay growth and lowsingledigit user growth on the ebay site a late  reorganization created a new business unit within paypal—merchant services—to provide payment solutions to small and large ecommerce merchants outside the ebay auction community starting in the second half of  paypal merchant services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants

for indian users to comply with reserve bank of india regulations the per transaction limit had been set to usd  since october   however on july   paypal has increased the per transaction limit to usd  this brings the per transaction limit for india in line with the restrictions imposed by paypal on most other countries paypal has disabled sending and receiving personal payments in india thus forcing all recipients to pay a transaction fee paypal plans to make india an incubation center for the companys employee engagement policies in  paypal hired  people for its offices in chennai and bangalore crimeaedit in january  paypal ceased operations in the crimea in compliance with international sanctions against russia and crimea turkeyedit eight years after the company first started operating in the country paypal ceased operations in turkey on  june  when turkish financial regulator bddk denied it a payments license the regulators had demanded that paypals data centers be located inside turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate tax revenue paypal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in turkey palestinian territoriesedit paypal is available in israel  but is not available in the palestinian territories nor can palestinians working in the west bank or gaza access it but israelis living in settlements in the west bank can use paypal this discrepancy has prompted tech companies to seek a policy change from paypal  paypal giving fundedit paypal giving fund is a registered charity supported by paypal that streamlines donations to nonprofit organizations paypal in pakistanedit commerce minister of pakistan khurram dastgir khan said that the government was making sincere efforts to bring paypal to pakistanwhile addressing the business community at pakistan sports goods manufacturers and exporters association in sialkot khan said the government was determined to digitalise the economy which can be proved by its effort to persuade paypal to begin operations in pakistan paypal authorities confirmed they will soon launching its services in pakistanthe ceo of resell pk web companay meets ceo of paypal to confirm this news regulationedit thiel a founder of paypal has stated that paypal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions if an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use paypal puts the limited access designation on the account paypal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as richard kyanka owner of the website something awful in september  cryptome in march  or april winchell the owner of regretsy in december  the account was reinstated paypal apologized and donated to her cause in september  paypal froze the account of markus persson developer of independent video game minecraft persson stated publicly that he had not received a clear explanation of why the account was frozen and that paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the electronic funds transfer act efta and california law most of the allegations concerned paypals dispute resolution procedures the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied any wrongdoing in june  stampscom filed a lawsuit against paypal and ebay claiming breach of contract breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing and interference with contract among other claims in a  license agreement stampscom and paypal agreed that stampscom technology would be made available to allow paypal users to buy and print postage online from their paypal accounts stampscom claimed that paypal did not live up to its contractual obligations and accused ebay of interfering with paypal and stampscoms agreement hence stampcoms reasoning for including ebay in the suit craig comb and two others filed a class action against paypal in craig comb et al v paypal inc they sued alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts and detailed their customer service experiences including freezing deposited funds for up to  days until disputes were resolved by paypal paypal argued that the plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their disputes under the

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple

in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal

the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms despite the slowdown in onebay growth and lowsingledigit user growth on the ebay site a late  reorganization created a new business unit within paypal—merchant services—to provide payment solutions to small and large ecommerce merchants outside the ebay auction community starting in the second half of  paypal merchant services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants

for indian users to comply with reserve bank of india regulations the per transaction limit had been set to usd  since october   however on july   paypal has increased the per transaction limit to usd  this brings the per transaction limit for india in line with the restrictions imposed by paypal on most other countries paypal has disabled sending and receiving personal payments in india thus forcing all recipients to pay a transaction fee paypal plans to make india an incubation center for the companys employee engagement policies in  paypal hired  people for its offices in chennai and bangalore crimeaedit in january  paypal ceased operations in the crimea in compliance with international sanctions against russia and crimea turkeyedit eight years after the company first started operating in the country paypal ceased operations in turkey on  june  when turkish financial regulator bddk denied it a payments license the regulators had demanded that paypals data centers be located inside turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate tax revenue paypal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in turkey palestinian territoriesedit paypal is available in israel  but is not available in the palestinian territories nor can palestinians working in the west bank or gaza access it but israelis living in settlements in the west bank can use paypal this discrepancy has prompted tech companies to seek a policy change from paypal  paypal giving fundedit paypal giving fund is a registered charity supported by paypal that streamlines donations to nonprofit organizations paypal in pakistanedit commerce minister of pakistan khurram dastgir khan said that the government was making sincere efforts to bring paypal to pakistanwhile addressing the business community at pakistan sports goods manufacturers and exporters association in sialkot khan said the government was determined to digitalise the economy which can be proved by its effort to persuade paypal to begin operations in pakistan paypal authorities confirmed they will soon launching its services in pakistanthe ceo of resell pk web companay meets ceo of paypal to confirm this news regulationedit thiel a founder of paypal has stated that paypal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions if an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use paypal puts the limited access designation on the account paypal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as richard kyanka owner of the website something awful in september  cryptome in march  or april winchell the owner of regretsy in december  the account was reinstated paypal apologized and donated to her cause in september  paypal froze the account of markus persson developer of independent video game minecraft persson stated publicly that he had not received a clear explanation of why the account was frozen and that paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the electronic funds transfer act efta and california law most of the allegations concerned paypals dispute resolution procedures the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied any wrongdoing in june  stampscom filed a lawsuit against paypal and ebay claiming breach of contract breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing and interference with contract among other claims in a  license agreement stampscom and paypal agreed that stampscom technology would be made available to allow paypal users to buy and print postage online from their paypal accounts stampscom claimed that paypal did not live up to its contractual obligations and accused ebay of interfering with paypal and stampscoms agreement hence stampcoms reasoning for including ebay in the suit craig comb and two others filed a class action against paypal in craig comb et al v paypal inc they sued alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts and detailed their customer service experiences including freezing deposited funds for up to  days until disputes were resolved by paypal paypal argued that the plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their disputes under the

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple

in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal

the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms despite the slowdown in onebay growth and lowsingledigit user growth on the ebay site a late  reorganization created a new business unit within paypal—merchant services—to provide payment solutions to small and large ecommerce merchants outside the ebay auction community starting in the second half of  paypal merchant services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants

for indian users to comply with reserve bank of india regulations the per transaction limit had been set to usd  since october   however on july   paypal has increased the per transaction limit to usd  this brings the per transaction limit for india in line with the restrictions imposed by paypal on most other countries paypal has disabled sending and receiving personal payments in india thus forcing all recipients to pay a transaction fee paypal plans to make india an incubation center for the companys employee engagement policies in  paypal hired  people for its offices in chennai and bangalore crimeaedit in january  paypal ceased operations in the crimea in compliance with international sanctions against russia and crimea turkeyedit eight years after the company first started operating in the country paypal ceased operations in turkey on  june  when turkish financial regulator bddk denied it a payments license the regulators had demanded that paypals data centers be located inside turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate tax revenue paypal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in turkey palestinian territoriesedit paypal is available in israel  but is not available in the palestinian territories nor can palestinians working in the west bank or gaza access it but israelis living in settlements in the west bank can use paypal this discrepancy has prompted tech companies to seek a policy change from paypal  paypal giving fundedit paypal giving fund is a registered charity supported by paypal that streamlines donations to nonprofit organizations paypal in pakistanedit commerce minister of pakistan khurram dastgir khan said that the government was making sincere efforts to bring paypal to pakistanwhile addressing the business community at pakistan sports goods manufacturers and exporters association in sialkot khan said the government was determined to digitalise the economy which can be proved by its effort to persuade paypal to begin operations in pakistan paypal authorities confirmed they will soon launching its services in pakistanthe ceo of resell pk web companay meets ceo of paypal to confirm this news regulationedit thiel a founder of paypal has stated that paypal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions if an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use paypal puts the limited access designation on the account paypal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as richard kyanka owner of the website something awful in september  cryptome in march  or april winchell the owner of regretsy in december  the account was reinstated paypal apologized and donated to her cause in september  paypal froze the account of markus persson developer of independent video game minecraft persson stated publicly that he had not received a clear explanation of why the account was frozen and that paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the electronic funds transfer act efta and california law most of the allegations concerned paypals dispute resolution procedures the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied any wrongdoing in june  stampscom filed a lawsuit against paypal and ebay claiming breach of contract breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing and interference with contract among other claims in a  license agreement stampscom and paypal agreed that stampscom technology would be made available to allow paypal users to buy and print postage online from their paypal accounts stampscom claimed that paypal did not live up to its contractual obligations and accused ebay of interfering with paypal and stampscoms agreement hence stampcoms reasoning for including ebay in the suit craig comb and two others filed a class action against paypal in craig comb et al v paypal inc they sued alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts and detailed their customer service experiences including freezing deposited funds for up to  days until disputes were resolved by paypal paypal argued that the plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their disputes under the

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple

in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal

the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied

its performance this year might be even better matthew cochrane cmfcochrane jan   at pm investors in paypal holdings inc nasdaqpypl didnt have much to be disappointed about in  paypals stock price opened the year at just a shade over  and closed  with a share price just below  for longterm investors who held the entire year this represented a tidy gain of about  pypl data by ycharts paypals business performance mirrored that of the stock price in the companys most recently reported quarter revenue was up  and nongaap earnings per share were up  both year over year perhaps more importantly the number of active accounts grew to  million up  from the year before and transactions per account increased to  up  of course all this is looking to the past what paypal investors really need to know is how the company will perform going forward with that in mind here are three possible catalysts for paypals stock in  pay with venmo venmo paypals peertopeer payment app is hugely popular with millennials who use it continually to split pizza among friends and share uber fares in s third quarter venmo processed  billion in payment volume up  year over year and up more than  from the prior quarter image source paypal holdings inc paypal obviously doesnt have a problem driving user growth on venmo the companys dilemma has been to find ways to make a profit through the app without jeopardizing its popularity paypal management believes the solution is pay with venmo a program that allows venmo account holders to make purchases from participating merchants at the beginning of  paypal reported approximately  venmo users were participating in the program by the end of the year it was available for all venmo users paypal management has said they are actively growing the merchant base for the program early data is encouraging ceo dan schulman said in the companys thirdquarter conference call that account holders who use pay with venmo are  more engaged than other venmo users given its popularity any method the company finds to monetize venmo could prove to be a financial boon paypal one touch paypals one touch allows account holders to authenticate their accounts the first time they use the platform to make an online purchase and then skip the log in process in subsequent uses consumers love the product because it saves them the time and hassle of retrieving their usernames and passwords and entering in all other pertinent information for every single purchase retailers love the product because it crushes the competition at online sales conversions according to a comscore study released last april paypals one touch converts an astounding  of all customers who enter a payment method during an online checkout process into an actual sale the closest competitor converted  its no wonder that one touch is the most rapidly adopted product in paypals history one touch is now available in over  markets in paypals thirdquarter conference call schulman stated that  million consumers and more than  million merchants were using the product by the end of  schulman projected that would increase to  million consumers and  million merchants ecommerce is paypals bread and butter with the rapid adoption and use of one touch paypal could well continue to dominate this arena for years to come stronger profits from xoom in november  paypal completed its acquisition of xoom the international remittance company in the thirdquarter earnings report paypal announced the addition of  new countries available for the xoom platform this means xooms domestic customers can now send money to friends or loved ones in over  countries in  of those countries xoom recipients can now send requests for money or bill payments image source paypal holdings inc consumers also can now link their paypal and xoom accounts a move that should drive account growth for both platforms in the  firstquarter conference call ceo schulman acknowledged xoom was currently margin dilutive and would likely remain so for the rest of  in the thirdquarter call he again admitted xoom had been a drag on our margins but he stated he fully expected xoom to start generating more significant profits in  given the additional countries available to the platform the new request feature and the integration of paypal and xoom accounts now available i wouldnt bet against that prediction this year matthew cochrane owns shares of paypal holdings the motley fool owns shares of and recommends paypal holdings the motley fool has a disclosure policy author

expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its

checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of

receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using

bangalore crimeaedit in january  paypal ceased operations in the crimea in compliance with international sanctions against russia and crimea turkeyedit eight years after the company first started operating in the country paypal ceased operations in turkey on  june  when turkish financial regulator bddk denied it a payments license the regulators had demanded that paypals data centers be located inside turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate tax revenue paypal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in turkey palestinian territoriesedit paypal is available in israel  but is not available in the palestinian territories nor can palestinians working in the west

services in pakistanthe ceo of resell pk web companay meets ceo of paypal to confirm this news regulationedit thiel a founder of paypal has stated that paypal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions if an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use paypal puts the limited access designation on the account paypal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as richard kyanka owner of

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the electronic funds transfer act efta and california law most of the allegations concerned paypals dispute resolution procedures the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied any wrongdoing in june  stampscom filed a lawsuit against paypal and ebay claiming breach of contract breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing and interference with contract among other claims in a  license agreement stampscom and paypal agreed that stampscom technology would be made available to allow paypal users to buy and print postage online from their paypal accounts stampscom claimed that paypal did not live up to its contractual obligations and accused ebay of interfering with paypal and stampscoms agreement hence stampcoms reasoning for including ebay in the suit craig comb and two others filed a class action against paypal in craig comb et al v paypal inc they sued alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts and detailed their customer service experiences including freezing deposited funds for up to  days until disputes were resolved by paypal paypal argued that the plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their disputes under the

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple

in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal

the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied

among other claims in a  license agreement stampscom and paypal agreed that stampscom technology would be made available to allow paypal users to buy and print postage online from their paypal

 this brings the per transaction limit for india in line with the restrictions imposed by paypal on most other countries paypal has disabled sending and receiving personal payments in india thus forcing all recipients to pay a transaction fee paypal plans to make india an incubation center for the companys employee engagement policies in  paypal hired  people for its offices in chennai and bangalore crimeaedit in january  paypal ceased operations in the crimea in compliance with international sanctions against russia and crimea turkeyedit eight years after the company first started operating in the country paypal ceased operations in turkey on  june  when turkish financial regulator bddk denied it a payments license the regulators had demanded that paypals data centers be located inside turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate tax revenue paypal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in turkey palestinian territoriesedit paypal is available in israel  but is not available in the palestinian territories nor can palestinians working in the west bank or gaza access it but israelis living in settlements in the west bank can use paypal this discrepancy has prompted tech companies to seek a policy change from paypal  paypal giving fundedit

the government was making sincere efforts to bring paypal to pakistanwhile addressing the business community at pakistan sports goods manufacturers and exporters association in sialkot khan said the government was determined to digitalise the economy which can be proved by its effort to persuade paypal to begin operations in pakistan paypal authorities confirmed they will soon launching its services in pakistanthe ceo of resell pk web companay meets ceo of paypal to confirm this news regulationedit thiel a founder of paypal has stated that paypal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions if an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use paypal puts the limited access designation on the account paypal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as richard kyanka owner of the website something awful in september  cryptome in march  or april winchell the owner of regretsy in december  the account was reinstated paypal apologized and donated to her cause in september

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the electronic funds transfer act efta and california law most of the allegations concerned paypals dispute resolution procedures the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied any wrongdoing in june  stampscom filed a lawsuit against paypal and ebay claiming breach of contract breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing and interference with contract among other claims in a  license agreement stampscom and paypal agreed that stampscom technology would be made available to allow paypal users to buy and print postage online from their paypal accounts stampscom claimed that paypal did not live up to its contractual obligations and accused ebay of interfering with paypal and stampscoms agreement hence stampcoms reasoning for including ebay in the suit craig comb and two others filed a class action against paypal in craig comb et al v paypal inc they sued alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts and detailed their customer service experiences including freezing deposited funds for up to  days until disputes were resolved by paypal paypal argued that the plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their disputes under the

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple

in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers

student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they

accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal

the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires

forcing all recipients to pay a transaction fee paypal plans to make india an incubation center for the companys employee engagement policies in  paypal hired  people for its offices in chennai and bangalore crimeaedit in january  paypal ceased operations in the crimea in compliance with international sanctions against russia and crimea turkeyedit eight years after the company first started operating in the country paypal ceased operations in turkey on  june  when turkish financial regulator bddk denied it a payments license the regulators had demanded that paypals data centers be located inside turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate tax revenue paypal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in turkey palestinian territoriesedit paypal is available in israel  but is not available in the palestinian territories nor can palestinians working in the west bank or gaza access it but israelis living in settlements in the west bank can use paypal this discrepancy has prompted tech companies to seek a policy change from paypal  paypal giving fundedit

services in pakistanthe ceo of resell pk web companay meets ceo of paypal to confirm this news regulationedit thiel a founder of paypal has stated that paypal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions if an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use paypal puts the limited access designation on the account paypal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as richard kyanka owner of the website something awful in september  cryptome in march  or april winchell the owner of regretsy in december  the account was reinstated paypal apologized and donated to her cause in september

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the electronic funds transfer act efta and california law most of the allegations concerned paypals dispute resolution procedures the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied any wrongdoing in june  stampscom filed a lawsuit against paypal and ebay claiming breach of contract breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing and interference with contract among other claims in a  license agreement stampscom and paypal agreed that stampscom technology would be made available to allow paypal users to buy and print postage online from their paypal accounts stampscom claimed that paypal did not live up to its contractual obligations and accused ebay of interfering with paypal and stampscoms agreement hence stampcoms reasoning for including ebay in the suit craig comb and two others filed a class action against paypal in craig comb et al v paypal inc they sued alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts and detailed their customer service experiences including freezing deposited funds for up to  days until disputes were resolved by paypal paypal argued that the plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their disputes under the

users and volumes was the product of a threephase strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business

in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed

later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several

student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they

paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal

strategy described by former ebay ceo meg whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms despite the slowdown in onebay growth and lowsingledigit user growth on the ebay site a late  reorganization created a new business unit within paypal—merchant services—to provide payment solutions to small and large ecommerce merchants outside the ebay auction community starting in the second half of  paypal merchant services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants outside the ebay auction

pay a transaction fee paypal plans to make india an incubation center for the companys employee engagement policies in  paypal hired  people for its offices in chennai and bangalore crimeaedit in january  paypal ceased operations in the crimea in compliance with international sanctions against russia and crimea turkeyedit eight years after the company first started operating in the country paypal ceased operations in turkey on  june  when turkish financial regulator bddk denied it a payments license the regulators had demanded that paypals data centers be located inside turkey to

of consumers in turkey palestinian territoriesedit paypal is available in israel  but is not available in the palestinian territories nor can palestinians working in the west bank or gaza access it

pakistanthe ceo of resell pk web companay meets ceo of paypal to confirm this news regulationedit thiel a founder of paypal has stated that paypal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions if an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use paypal puts the limited access designation on the account paypal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as richard kyanka owner of

paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the electronic funds transfer act efta and california law most of the allegations concerned paypals dispute resolution procedures the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied any wrongdoing in june  stampscom filed a lawsuit against paypal and ebay claiming breach of contract breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing and interference with contract among other claims in a  license agreement stampscom and paypal agreed that stampscom technology would be made available to allow paypal users to buy and print postage online from their paypal accounts stampscom claimed that paypal did not live up to its contractual obligations and accused ebay of interfering with paypal and stampscoms agreement hence stampcoms reasoning for including ebay in the suit craig comb and two others filed a class action against paypal in craig comb et al v paypal inc they sued alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts and detailed their customer service experiences including freezing deposited funds for up to  days until disputes were resolved by paypal paypal argued that the plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their disputes under the

whitman first paypal focused on expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem

relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal

payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged € to all its card users without authorization  users as of march  most funds have not been returned paypal mycash reloadable card embezzlementedit paypal mycash ppmc cards are purchased and loaded at retail and pharmacy stores in the us these cards are provided by the corporation incomm funds can only be loaded to paypal accounts and are done so by scratching off silvering on the rear of the card to reveal a secure pin it has been discovered that these secure pin numbers are stored plaintext in a database accessible to many incomm it employees employees have taken pins and loaded or traded them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim assisted fraud the extent of this situation is not yet known but a victim with a small blog was able to find  in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this a video reveals a pin number being known before silvering has been scratched off and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former incomm database administrator criticismedit see also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions if an account is subject to fraud or unauthorized use paypal puts the limited access designation on the account paypal has had several notable cases in which the company has frozen the account of users such as richard kyanka owner of the website something awful in september  cryptome in march  or april winchell the owner of regretsy in december  the account was reinstated paypal apologized and donated to her cause in september  paypal froze the account of markus persson developer of independent video game minecraft persson stated publicly that he had not received a clear explanation of why the account was frozen and that paypal was threatening to keep the money if they found anything wrong his account contained around € paypals partner mastercard ceased taking donations to wikileaks in  and paypal also suspended and later permanently restricted payments to the website after the us state department deemed wikileaks activities as illegal online supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined to pay a reward offered in its bug bounty program to a yearold german student who discovered a crosssite scripting flaw on its site the company took the position that because the student was under  years old he did not qualify to participate in the program in violation of the programs terms and conditions in august  entrepreneurs who had used paypal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january  a classaction lawsuit against paypal has been filed in israel claiming that they arbitrarily freeze accounts and hold funds for up to  days without paying interest and thereby directly profit from it the lawsuit requests that paypal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly in may  paypal blocked the account of a russian human rights organisation rosuznik which supported political prisoners arrested at bolotnaya square case in april  the guardian reported paypal blocking the account of londonbased human rights group justice for iran in may  paypal blocked an account intended to raise money for the distribution of boris nemtsovs report putin war the explanation by paypal was that paypal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in russia though paypals acceptable use policy does not mention financing for political goals nongovernmental organization freedom house issued a statement that paypal should immediately lift this ban to help rather than hinder press freedom in russia in  paypal generated controversy after it was discovered that one of its founders peter thiel had funded a lawsuit brought by hulk hogan against gawker thiel may have benefited from the  million lawsuit that was decided in favor of the former wrestler by  consumeraffairs had received over  consumer complaints relating to paypal policies consumers have also launched numerous antipaypal facebook sites and twitter accounts to air their complaints in february  paypal froze the account of news media canada a canadian trade association in response to a payment from the reminder a flin flon manitoba community newspaper intended to cover the fee for the reminders submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by news media canada including one discussing syrian refugees paypal cited united states regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between canadian entities litigationedit in march  two paypal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the electronic funds transfer act efta and california law most of the allegations concerned paypals dispute resolution procedures the two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit in re paypal litigation an informal settlement was reached in november  and a formal settlement was signed on june   the settlement requires that paypal change its business practices including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them eftacompliant as well as making a us million payment to members of the class paypal denied any wrongdoing in june  stampscom filed a lawsuit against paypal and ebay claiming breach of contract breach of the implied covenants

agreement hence stampcoms reasoning for including ebay in the suit craig comb and two others filed a class action against paypal in craig comb et al v paypal inc they sued alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts and detailed their customer service experiences including freezing deposited funds for up to  days until disputes were resolved by paypal paypal argued that the

expanding its service among ebay users in the us second we began expanding paypal to ebays international sites and third we started to build paypals business off ebay phase edit in the first phase payment volumes were coming mostly from the ebay auction website the system was very attractive to auction sellers most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards and for consumers as well in fact many sellers could not qualify for a credit card merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history the service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund paypal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers paypal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth depositing  in new users paypal accounts phase edit until  paypals strategy was to earn interest on funds in paypal accounts however most recipients of paypal credits withdrew funds immediately also a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards which cost paypal roughly  of payment value per transaction to solve this problem paypal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds paypal started relying on earnings from service charges they offered seller protection to paypal account holders provided that they comply with reimbursement policies for example paypal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over  phase edit after finetuning paypals business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on ebay paypal started its offebay strategy this was

founder of paypal has stated that paypal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractionalreserve banking rather paypals funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interestbearing checking accounts in the united states paypal is licensed as a money transmitter on a statebystate basis but state laws vary as do their definitions of banks narrow banks money services businesses and money transmitters although paypal is not classified as a bank the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry including regulation e consumer protections and the usa patriot act the most analogous regulatory source of law for paypal transactions comes from pp payments using credit and debit cards ordinarily a credit card transaction specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder is governed by the truth in lending act tila  usc §§ f as implemented by regulation z  cfr  tilaz tilaz requires specific procedures for billing errors dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges similarly the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the electronic funds transfer act efta  usc §§ r as implemented by regulation e  cfr  eftae eftae is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures however because paypal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly tilaz and eftae do not operate exactly as written once the creditdebit card transaction occurs via paypal basically unless a paypal transaction is funded with a credit card the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller in  paypal europe was granted a luxembourg banking license which under european union law allows it to conduct banking business throughout the eu it is therefore regulated as a bank by luxembourgs banking supervisory authority the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf all of the companys european accounts were transferred to paypals bank in luxembourg in july  prior to this move paypal had been registered in the united kingdom as paypal europe ltd an entity which was licensed as an electronic money issuer with the uks financial services authority fsa from  this ceased in  when the company moved to luxembourg in india as of january  paypal has no crossborder money transfer authorization in the new york times article indias central bank stops some paypal services reserve bank of india spokesman alpana killawalla stated providers of crossborder money transfer service need prior authorization from the reserve bank under the payment and settlement systems act paypal does not have our authorization paypal is not listed in the certificates of authorisation issued by the reserve bank of india under the payment and settlement systems act  for setting up and operating payment system in india paisapay is an indian sister service to paypal and is also owned by ebay paisapay makes possible payments from abroad by paypal account holders to indian sellers on ebayin in australia paypal is licensed as an authorised deposittaking institution adi and is thus subject to australian banking laws and regulations safety and protection policiesedit the paypal buyer protection policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described the customer can open a dispute within  days for registered uk residents  days changed  june  from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within  days from opening the dispute if the buyer used a credit card he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her creditcard company however in the uk where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation under section  consumer credit act  the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via paypal also the financial ombudsman service position is that section  protection does not apply where paypal or any emoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction this leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the financial ombudsman service they only have recourse with the courts however the key issues which determine the applicability of section  are identified very clearly in office of fair trading v lloyds tsb bank plc and others  ewca civ   and the bank of scotland v alfred truman a firm  ewhc  qb this is legal authority that section  protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product via an emoney service according to paypal it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the seller protection policy in general the seller protection policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer paypal states the seller protection policy is designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of nonreceipt of any merchandise the policy includes a list of exclusions which itself includes intangible goods claims for receipt of goods not as described and total reversals over the annual limit there are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the seller protection policy is in effect the paypal seller protection policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by uk consumer legislation eg sale of goods act and in addition it cannot be enforced in the courts because paypal operates from luxembourg outside all three of the uk legal jurisdictions securityedit security tokenedit main article security token in early  paypal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud a user account tied to a security key has a modified login process the account holder enters his or her login id and password as normal but is then prompted to enter a sixdigit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holders mobile phone for convenience the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen this way he or she is not prompted for it on another page this method is required for some services such as when using paypal through the ebay application on iphone this twofactor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key although it does not prevent socalled man in the browser mitb attacks however the user or malicious third party can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account thus the paypal implementation does not offer the security of true twofactor authentication mtanedit it is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mtan mobile transaction authentication number via sms use of a security code that is sent to the account holders mobile phone is currently free fraudedit as early as  paypal had substantial problems with online fraud especially international hackers who were hacking into paypal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters but with paypal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the fbi to pursue cases of international fraud paypal developed a private solution a fraud monitoring system that used artificial intelligence to detect potentially fraudulent transactions  rather than treating the problem of fraud as a legal problem the company treated it as a risk management one  paypal cards frozenedit in   spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a paypal service provider younique money which was the de facto administrator of the cards previously paypal had charged

them for their own purposes meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company itc financial licenses under incomm with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in victim

also criticism of ebay in  paypal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers at the time of this cessation it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions in  paypal resumed accepting such transactions but only in those countries where online gambling is legal and only for sites which are properly licensed to

supporters and activists retaliated by subjecting paypal and mastercard along with other companies to coordinated cyber attacks in february  paypal unbanned the account of a website that supports iraq war resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines the chelsea manning support network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account as of december  paypal is involved in several classaction lawsuits in a controversy over their policy of holding  of vendor transactions for  days for some merchants and sellers which paypal argues is intended to make funds available to customers in the event that a transaction is found to be fraudulent to provide paypal the funds to refund the seller in may  paypal declined

crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter and indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money most notable victims are ouya glassup a rival to google glass and mailpile as of january
