per share after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full we estimate that our net proceeds will be  million we currently anticipate that we will use approximately  million of the net proceeds received by us to support ongoing sales and marketing activities for vgo and to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure we anticipate we will use approximately  million of the net proceeds received by us to fund research development and engineering activities and manufacturing capabilities which we expect to include the further development of our vgo prefill and vgo link products although we expect that we will need to seek additional capital to complete their development and commercialization we expect that the remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of cash generated by our operations our cash needs the rate of adoption of our products by the medical community and efficiency of our product development we may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors we therefore cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net proceeds to be used for the purposes described above we may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes and we will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds pending the uses described above we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government the medical technology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products competition in the diabetes market is particularly intense due largely to the fact that products designed to treat diabetes currently compete with both traditional and new products we compete with these products based on efficacy price reimbursement ease of use and healthcare provider education within the diabetes market vgo is cleared by the fda for adult patients who require insulin with either type  or type  diabetes although we position vgo to compete primarily in the market for adult patients with type  diabetes requiring insulin particularly as part of a basalbolus insulin regimen our primary competitors in the basalbolus insulin therapy market are manufacturers of insulin and insulin pens such as novo nordisk sanofi sa and eli lilly and company in addition to basalbolus insulin therapy glucagonlike peptide or glp analog injection products are another potential competitor to vgo glp analog injection products are used in combination with oads or basal insulin injection some physicians when faced with a patient who is unable to reach or maintain glucose levels at his or her goal with oads will add a glp through twicedaily oncedaily or onceweekly injections as a result we also compete with pharmaceutical manufacturers of glp analog injection products such as astrazeneca novo nordisk and glaxosmithkline plc in addition we may compete with inhaled insulin products for bolus therapy which have been recently introduced to the market in the area of basalbolus device competition we do not consider programmable insulin pumps to be products that compete directly with vgo as those products although cleared for both type  and type  diabetes have been primarily designed and marketed for patients with type  diabetes we believe that the simple and discreet design and interface of vgo more directly addresses the needs of patients with type  diabetes patients with type  diabetes for example are often taking many drugs for multiple diseases including medications to treat high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol and as a result they desire a simple to use and discreet method to deliver their insulin we are not aware of any other singleuse disposable mechanical which means the device does not include any electronics batteries or audible alarms and does not require any recharging or programming basalbolus insulin delivery devices currently marketed or in development at this time company description we are a commercialstage medical technology company focused on improving health and simplifying life for people with diabetes by developing and commercializing innovative technologies we designed our first commercialized product the vgowearable insulin delivery device or vgo to help patients with type  diabetes who require insulin to achieve and maintain their target blood glucose goals vgo is indicated for continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin over  hours and ondemand bolus dosing in twounit increments in adult patients requiring insulin vgo is a small discreet and easytouse disposable insulin delivery device that a patient adheres to his or her skin vgo is not considered durable medical equipment because it is not intended for repeated use each vgo device is designed to be worn for  hours removed from the body and disposed vgo enables patients to closely mimic the body’s normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery throughout the day and to manage their diabetes with insulin without the need to plan a daily routine around multiple daily injections we currently focus on the treatment of patients with type  diabetes—a pervasive and costly disease that according to the  national diabetes statistics report released by the us centers for disease control and prevention or the cdc currently affects  to  of the approximately  million us adults diagnosed with diabetes the cdc estimated that the combined direct medical and drug costs and indirect lost productivity costs of diabetes in the united states was approximately  billion in  we believe the majority of the  million us adults treating their type  diabetes with more than one daily oral antidiabetic drug or oad or an injectable diabetes medicine can benefit from the innovative approach of vgo to manage type  diabetes our nearterm target market consists of the approximately  million of these patients who currently take injectable insulin of which up to  million may not be achieving their target blood glucose goal insulin therapies using syringes pens and programmable insulin pumps are often burdensome to a type  diabetes patient’s daily routine which can lead to poor adherence to prescribed insulin regimens and as a result ineffective diabetes management we developed vgo utilizing our core technology the hpatchplatform as a patientfocused solution to address the challenges of traditional insulin therapies our hpatch platform facilitates the simple and effective subcutaneous delivery of injectable medicines to patients across a broad range of therapeutic areas vgo enables patients to closely mimic the body’s normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery by releasing a single type of insulin at a continuous preset background or basal rate over a hour period and ondemand or bolus dosing around mealtime we believe vgo is an attractive management tool for patients with type  diabetes requiring insulin because it only requires a single fill of insulin prior to use and provides comprehensive basalbolus therapy without the burden and inconvenience associated with multiple daily injections vgo is available in three different dosages depending on the patient’s needs and is generally cost competitive for both patients and thirdparty payors when compared to insulin pens or programmable insulin pumps vgo was one of the first insulin delivery devices cleared by the us food and drug administration or fda under its infusion pump improvement initiative which established additional device manufacturing requirements designed to foster the development of safer more effective infusion pumps and is the only fdacleared mechanical basalbolus insulin delivery device in the united states all other fdacleared basalbolus insulin delivery products currently available in the united states are electronic and are classified as “durable medical equipment” and although cleared for both type  and type  diabetes were designed primarily for patients with type  diabetes vgo is a mechanical device and it does not include any electronics batteries or audible alarms and does not require any recharging or programming which allows for simple and discreet use unlike electronic insulin delivery devices vgo is not classified as durable medical equipment by the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms allowing for potential medicare reimbursement under medicare part d the medicare part d outpatient drug benefit defines vgo and certain other supplies used for injecting insulin as “drugs” which allows vgo to be available for coverage by part d plans under medicare part d in addition to medicare a majority of commercially insured patients are currently covered for vgo under their insurance plans we commenced commercial sales of vgo in the united states during  during the first half of  we initiated an early access program to provide a limited number of physicians with free vgo products for patients and began shipments to major wholesalers in anticipation of commercial launch in the second half of  we began hiring sales representatives in selected us markets at the end of  our sales team consisted of  sales representatives covering  territories primarily in the east south midwest and southwest regions of the united states in february  we underwent a reductioninforce to focus our resources on prioritized highervolume territories and we currently have  sales representatives in  territories generally speaking each sales professional covers one prioritized territory when we refer to our financial results in this prospectus for periods prior to the  merger discussed below we are referring to the financial results of valeritas inc the accounting acquirer in the  merger our net losses were  million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively our accumulated deficit as of december   and  was  million and  million respectively since launching vgo the total number of prescriptions for and the number of patients using vgo have increased each quarter based on prescription data we estimate that there were approximately  prescriptions reported for vgo filled during the year ended december   refill prescriptions account for nearly twothirds of our total prescriptions and generally move in parallel with our patient retention rates so can be used as a proxy to determine patient retention rates we estimate that as of december   over  million vgo’s had been dispensed to patients and used for over  million cumulative patient days  we were incorporated in the state of delaware on may   in connection with the  merger
