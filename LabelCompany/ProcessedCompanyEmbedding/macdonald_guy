to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance the fastfood chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk uk chief executive steve easterbrook said british consumers are increasingly interested in the quality sourcing and ethics of the food and drink they buy in a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market mcdonalds switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks

still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes and in all of its dairy products in the united states according to a report published by farmers weekly in  the quantity of milk used by mcdonalds could have accounted for as much as  percent of the uks organic milk output mcdonalds announced on may   that in the united states and canada it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats

collected by veolia environmental services and were used to produce energy at a power plant mcdonalds plans to expand this project although the lack of biomass power plants in the united states will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon in addition in europe mcdonalds has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks mcdonalds has been using a cornbased bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products the environmental benefits of this technology are controversial with critics noting that biodegradation is slow produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts in  mcdonalds worked with the environmental defense fund to stop using clam shell shaped styrofoam food containers to house its food products  years later mcdonalds announced they would try replacing styrofoam coffee cups with an alternative material the us environmental protection agency has recognized mcdonalds continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycledcontent materials mcdonalds reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant in an effort to reduce energy usage by  percent in its restaurants mcdonalds opened a prototype restaurant in chicago in  with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world building on past efforts specifically a restaurant it opened in sweden in  that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas mcdonalds designed the chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods when mcdonalds received criticism for its environmental policies in the s it began to make substantial progress in reducing its use of materials for instance an average meal in the s—a big mac fries and a drink—required  grams of packaging today it requires only  grams allowing a  percent reduction in addition mcdonalds eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers saving two million pounds  tonnes of packaging annually overall weight reductions in packaging and products as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by twentyfour million pounds  tonnes annually legal cases main article mcdonalds legal cases mcdonalds has been involved in a
