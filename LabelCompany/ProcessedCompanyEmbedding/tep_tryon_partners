bellissimo further commented “the weg is a very challenging and complicated event  with the exception of aachen germany most venues are forced to spend many years and tens of millions of dollars investing and developing the venue infrastructure developing the personnel attracting sponsors and managing logistics for the weg this takes a financial and operational toll by consuming scarce resources on the venue construction and team building efforts for a onetime event we have a fully functional equestrian venue the management team and operational staff and the sponsor pipeline in place so the bulk of our energy will be on operational execution and showcasing the event and the sport to the world” bellissimo added “we are uniquely and immediately positioned to hold all eight
