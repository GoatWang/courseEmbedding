helm in turbulent timesthe ceo of the worlds largest maker of marine engines and pleasure boats has done his best to keep a yearold company afloatjuly  by kathy bergen tribune reporterwith his flight delayed by wind and driving rain brunswick corp chief executive dustan mccoy stood just inside a hangar at waukegan regional airport and watched a tiny cessna trying to land the pilot finally touched down on his third try ive got to give him credit said mccoy a former army helicopter pilot familiar with distressing situations a lawyer by training he has spent the past several years steering the worlds largest maker of marine engines and pleasure boats — luxury items suited for boom times — through the worst economic decline since the great depression mccoy jettisoned  percent of its employees in a major downsizing to keep the yearold company afloat mccoy an expansionminded dealmaker had spent prerecession years adding boat companies to brunswicks roster only to be forced to reverse course and reduce boat brands from  to  lake forestbased brunswick which also makes bowling billiards and life fitness equipment closed or mothballed  of its  plants and is consolidating its two us marine engine plants the workforce stands at  the moves cut about  million in costs and dramatically reduced boatproduction levels in late  and early  there were some who questioned whether the company was going to make it said joe hovorka leisure analyst at raymond james  associates inc we werent one of them but it gives a backdrop of what dusty was dealing with mccoy  an asthma sufferer who rises before dawn to work out and is known throughout the industry by the nickname dusty is something of a worker bee on steroids its a trait he attributes to his upbringing on a dairy and tobacco farm in northeastern kentucky where he was expected to milk cows put up hay cut tobacco and hoe corn the way my mother used to describe it its not good enough to do your best its only good enough if you do it better than anyone else before you mccoy said my parents never told me i was smart or goodlooking nothing like that it was get up and get the work done it has served me well in many ways the boat business serves as a barometer of the economy when people feel flush they are more inclined to buy powerboats which retail on average for more than  brunswicks brands run the gamut from bayliner runabouts for weekend pleasure boating which start at  to searay sport boats and yachts from  to  million at the very high end a hatteras yacht can run  million at those prices boat sales are highly sensitive to the availability of credit its how dealers finance inventory its how customers finance purchases — so in the credit meltdown … this industry was like ground zero said edward aaron an analyst with rbc capital markets llc brunswick sold dealers  boats last year down from  in  its a staggering drop americans on average bought  powerboats a year from the s to the early s when the level dropped to about  since  the figure plunged falling to about  last year the sharp contraction forced an aboutface for mccoy before his rise to ceo in  he headed brunswicks boat group where he was the lead guy on virtually all the boat company acquisitions said pat mackey a senior brunswick executive until his retirement in  mccoy was a key part of the team that broadened brunswicks portfolio adding the luxury hatteras yachts at one end and reestablishing the aluminumboat division on the other mackey said today the moves are easy to secondguess particularly because the subsequent restructuring of the boat business cost the company more than  million but at the time it made a lot of sense mackey said mccoy was trying to make brunswicks marine business into a really integrated holistic powerhouse … he was astute in trying to fill the holes in the product line brunswick executives began to sense a slowdown in the economy as early as the fourth quarter of  in the aftermath of five big hurricanes including katrina rising prices for crude oil threw up red flags as well we began to feel a tightening mccoy recalls so mccoy new in his ceo role and his team quickly moved to replace failed dealerships in its network so it could transfer inventory rather than having to buy it all back and keep sales going mccoy also restructured brunswicks debt pushing back its next significant payment until  its net debt is now  million down from  million at the end of  he believes he and his team maneuvered brunswick into position to benefit from any economic upturn weve baked this wonderful cherry pie mccoy said but the rewards will only be tasted as the economy improves and as boat sales pick up he added so its sort of sitting in the refrigerator      next moreno
