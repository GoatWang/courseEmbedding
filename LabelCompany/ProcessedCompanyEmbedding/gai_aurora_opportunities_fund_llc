limited liability company has been registered as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” since january    the fund is a closedend management investment company  alternative strategies group inc the “adviser” a north carolina corporation is the investment adviser to the fund the fund’s investment objective is to generate consistent longterm capital appreciation with diversification of risk through the use of a “multimanager multistrategy” global investment strategy  the fund seeks to accomplish this objective by allocating its capital primarily among a select group of collective investment vehicles “investment funds” managed by experienced investment managers “investment managers” that implement a number of different alternative investment strategies and invest in a variety of worldwide markets  fair value measurements   the fund measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are ● level  – unadjusted quoted prices for identical securities in an active market since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readilyaccessible at the measurement date valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment ● level  – quoted prices in nonactive markets for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly level  inputs may also include pricing models whose inputs are observable or derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data ● level  – prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value and unobservable little if any market activity exists for level  securities           asgi aurora opportunities fund llc schedule of investments unaudited continued as of december     the adviser considers subscriptions and redemption rights including any restrictions on the disposition of the interest in its determination of fair value  investments in the investment funds are included in level  of the fair value hierarchy if the fund has the ability to redeem its investment within  days of fiscal period end by providing a redemption notice within  days of fiscal period end  all other investments in investment funds are classified as level  the fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at the end of the reporting period   the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities  a summary of the inputs used to value the funds members capital as of december   is as follows

investment funds still held as of december   was  accounting standards update “asu”  permits a reporting entity to measure the fair value of an investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value based on the net asset value per share the “nav” of the investment as a practical expedient without further adjustment unless it is probable that the investment will be sold at a value significantly different than the nav  if the practical expedient nav is not as of the reporting entity’s measurement date then the nav should be adjusted to reflect any significant events that may change the valuation  in using the nav as a practical expedient certain attributes of the investment that may impact the fair value of the investment are not considered in measuring fair value  attributes of those investments include the investment strategies of the investees and may also include but are not limited to restrictions on the investor’s ability to redeem its investments at the measurement date and any unfunded commitments  the fund is permitted to invest in alternative investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and as such has elected to use the nav as calculated on the reporting entity’s measurement date as the fair value of the investment             asgi aurora opportunities fund llc schedule of investments unaudited continued as of december     the following is a summary of the investment strategies of the investments in the investment funds held in the fund as of december   longshort equities strategies generally involve taking both long and short positions in equity securities that are deemed to be under or overvalued  although the combination of long and short investing can provide an element of protection against but not eliminate directional market exposure longshort equities investment managers generally do not attempt to neutralize the amount of long and short positions ie they will be net long or net short  investment managers may specialize in a particular industry or geographic region or they may diversify holdings across industries or geographic regions  investment managers in this strategy usually employ a low to moderate degree of leverage multistrategy opportunistic strategies generally involve investment managers exercising discretion in allocating capital among several types of arbitrage eventdriven and directional strategies eg longshort equities relative value longshort credit activist volatility trading and capital structure arbitrage  capital is opportunistically allocated as such investment managers perceive each strategy’s opportunity set changing with market conditions event driven strategies generally include investments in securities of companies involved in identifiable corporate actions such as mergers acquisitions restructurings spinoffs shareholder activism or other special situations which alter a company’s financial structure or operating strategy  risk management and hedging techniques may be employed to protect the portfolio from events that fail to materialize  in addition accurately forecasting the timing of an event is an important element impacting the realized return  the use of leverage varies considerably macro strategies generally involve fundamental discretionary directional trading in currencies commodities bonds and equities  investment managers utilizing macro strategies invest in a wide variety of strategies and instruments often assuming an aggressive risk posture  most investment managers rely on macroeconomic analyses to invest across countries markets sectors and companies and have the flexibility to invest in numerous financial instruments  futures options and other derivative instruments are often used for hedging and speculation and the use of leverage varies considerably longshort credit strategies generally involve investment managers taking both long and short positions in credit related instruments such as corporate bonds bank loans trade claims emerging market debt and credit derivatives eg credit default swaps  investment managers utilizing this strategy usually invest in companies in financial difficulty reorganization or bankruptcy and their portfolios often are concentrated in debt instruments  the use of leverage varies considerably  investment managers differ in their preference for actively participating in the workout and restructuring process and the extent to which they use leverage  although longshort credit strategies typically involve positions in debt instruments and credit derivatives the investment managers implementing this strategy generally perform extensive research on companies and may use this information to invest both long and short in the equity securities of such companies         item  controls and procedures   a the registrant’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions have
