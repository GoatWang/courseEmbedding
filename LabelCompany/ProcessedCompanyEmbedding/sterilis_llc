leader  conference awards dinner in denver other winners included samsung disney timberland and general motors gm the sterilis device is a safer more sustainable and proven alternative to the decadesold method of hauling dangerous regulated medical waste also known as infectious waste offsite by truck to be incinerated sterilis’ device uses steam sterilization and grinding technologies to transform infectious waste into a harmless confettilike material which can be disposed of in the general waste stream the sterilis method of disposal eliminates toxic air pollution created when rmw is incinerated which is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions “we created the sterilis device to address a burning need for more sustainable and safer disposal of medical waste and we are honored to see our efforts recognized by environmental leader” said jeff bell founder president chief financial officer and chairman of the board of directors at sterilis “the sterilis method for infectious waste disposal disrupts the rmw industry by allowing facilities to safely remediate waste onsite and at pointofcare using steam sterilization and grinding technologies which reduces the waste volume by about  percent not only does this create a smaller waste footprint but it protects the environment by preventing the need for waste incineration which has been cited by the epa as a major contributor to climate change” launched earlier this year the sterilis device is already being used by over  health facilities to reduce their dependence on the haul and burn method of waste disposal and improve sustainability the patented system is about the size of an office photocopier and is completely portable it plugs into a standard electrical outlet and requires no plumbing or drainage early adopters of the device include dialysis centers surgery centers dermatology and ophthalmology centers hospitals clinical labs needleexchange programs federally qualified health centers

and danger earlier in the medical waste lifecycle impact all downstream handling issues and costs by reducing the waste hauling cost and carbon emissions” the sterilis device is a proven method of safely disposing of harmful regulated medical waste a few key benefits also include improved hospital and waste worker safety by limiting multiple touch points associated with current waste disposal

medical waste the same way today as when i got into nursing  years ago  it’s about time someone used technology to protect healthcare professionals  lilian longo rn ma it’s much more economical it’s better for the environment it reduces risk by eliminating the need to store medical waste onsite  for me sterilis was a very easy decision  dr amy forman taub  advanced dermatology lincolnshire illinois “the healthcare industry is constantly being challenged to control costs while providing better care for patients sterilis has the product to lower patient and employee risk contain rising costs with a fixed cost solution and make facilities more sustainable” said sandy kurtz “sterilis has a unique technology whereby it can treat regulated medical waste at pointofcare that can be applied in many healthcare situations”  sandy kurtz md “i’m always on the lookout for new technologies that will improve patient care and improve our practice the sterilis system gives us a safe and effective way to treat regulated medical waste while reducing our risk and liability”  dr jeffrey dover  skincare physicians chestnut hill ma “sterilis is an industry disrupter that will profoundly change the way medical waste is managed no longer is it acceptable to package store and transport the massive quantities of medical waste generated by the united states medical system to a few processing plants scattered across the country”  dr seth yellin  marietta facial plastic surgery laser  aesthetics center “sterilis is a simple solution that allowed us to eliminate the storage of hazardous medical waste along with the record keeping it also greatly reduced the cost of disposing of our regulated materials it is a win win win for any practice or surgical center that generates medical waste ”  dr michael oats  ophthalmic consultants of boston “the inherent liability and risks of trucking contaminated waste across the country for disposal the fossil fuel consumed in the process and the greenhouse gases generated make this mode of medical waste disposal both outdated and expensive by treating contaminated medical waste of all kinds on site at the location where it is created and then disposing of the treated material as regular trash medical facilities will lower their costs our roads will be less crowded and safer and the environment will benefit everybody wins”
