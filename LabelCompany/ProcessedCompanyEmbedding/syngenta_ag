november  switzerland enacted a fiveyear ban on the farming of genetically modified crops underscoring the problems facing the european commission and biotech companies like syngenta bayer and

sought to acquire syngenta for a reported  billion but syngenta rejected the offer since april  monsanto and syngenta had been working with their investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs respectively on a deal the us treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion syngentas board of directors rejected an even better offer by monsanto during august  and monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on  august according to the swiss business weekly finanz und wirtschaft many syngenta shareholders were enraged both by the companys refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with monsanto and with the subsequent offer withdrawal this resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the alliance of critical syngenta shareholders which urged the board to evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice in a recent interview chairman michel demaré was asked whether syngenta could remain independent he responded if you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize then it would be possible but in these circumstances where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price what they think this company is worth it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months he thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold especially given industry consolidation which is creating larger competitors the failed monsanto buyout caused syngenta shares to increase by nearly  in february  chemchina a chinese stateowned enterprise offered to purchase syngenta for  billion  swiss francs per share a deal which the company unanimously recommended to shareholders” in april  the federal trade commission the committee on foreign investment in the united states and the european commissioner for competition approved of the acquisition allowing the largest foreign takeover in chinese history to proceed to secure approval chemchina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat abamectin and chlorothalonil as an

syngenta rejected the offer since april  monsanto and syngenta had been working with their investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs respectively on a deal the us treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion syngentas board of directors rejected an even better offer by monsanto during august  and monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on  august according to the swiss business weekly finanz und wirtschaft many syngenta shareholders were enraged both by the companys refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with monsanto and with the subsequent offer withdrawal this resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the alliance of critical syngenta shareholders which urged the board to evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice in a recent interview chairman michel demaré was asked whether syngenta could remain independent he responded if you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize then it would be possible but in these circumstances where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price what they think this company is worth it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months he thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold especially given industry consolidation which is creating larger competitors the failed monsanto buyout caused syngenta shares to increase by

syngenta opposed a swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms on  november  switzerland enacted a fiveyear ban on the farming of genetically modified crops underscoring the problems facing the european commission and biotech companies like syngenta bayer and monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety as of update syngentas main competitors are monsanto company basf dow agrosciences bayer cropscience and dupont pioneer in  monsanto sought to acquire syngenta for a reported  billion but syngenta rejected the offer since april  monsanto and syngenta had been working with their investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs respectively on a deal the us treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion syngentas board of directors rejected an even better offer by monsanto during august  and monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on  august according to the swiss business weekly finanz und wirtschaft many syngenta shareholders were enraged both by the companys refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with monsanto and with the subsequent offer withdrawal this resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the alliance of critical syngenta shareholders which urged the board to evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice in a recent interview chairman michel demaré was asked whether syngenta could remain independent he responded if you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize then it would be possible but in these circumstances where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price what they think this company is worth it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months he thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold especially given industry consolidation which is creating larger competitors the failed monsanto buyout caused syngenta shares to increase by nearly  in february  chemchina a chinese stateowned enterprise offered to purchase syngenta for  billion  swiss francs per share a deal which the company unanimously recommended to shareholders” in april  the federal trade commission the committee on foreign investment in the united

workers– cibageigy then applied for and was granted permission to market galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton however as further long term monitoring data was obtained regulators banned

court since  in the us syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding viptera genetically modified corn the plaintiffs in nearly  states contend that syngentas introduction of viptera drove down us grain market prices leading to financial harm and that syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports before vipteras  introduction syngenta secured all us and ncgarecommended export approvals but none from china china had imported little to no us grain prior to  and at the time was not considered a major partner but it became a major partner in  when it dramatically increased us grain imports for three years china imported us viptera grain without formal approval in november  chinese officials

agrosciences bayer cropscience and dupont pioneer in  monsanto sought to acquire syngenta for a reported  billion but syngenta rejected the offer since april  monsanto and syngenta had been working with their investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs respectively on a deal the us treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion syngentas board of directors rejected an even better offer by monsanto during august  and monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on  august according to the swiss business weekly finanz und wirtschaft many syngenta shareholders were enraged both by the companys refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with monsanto and with the subsequent offer withdrawal this resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the alliance of critical syngenta shareholders which urged the board to evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice in a recent interview chairman michel demaré was asked whether syngenta could remain independent he responded if you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize then it would be possible but in these circumstances where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price what they think this company is worth it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months he thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold especially given industry consolidation which is creating larger competitors the failed monsanto buyout caused syngenta shares to increase by nearly  in february  chemchina a chinese stateowned enterprise offered to purchase syngenta for  billion  swiss francs per share a deal which the company unanimously recommended to shareholders” in april  the federal trade commission the committee on foreign investment in the united

jealotts hill near bracknell in  syngenta seeds purchased garst the north american corn and soybean business of advanta as well as golden harvest seeds on  december  the european union ended a sixyear moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by monsanto and its swiss rival syngenta in  syngenta opposed a swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms on  november  switzerland enacted a fiveyear ban on the farming of genetically modified crops underscoring the problems facing the european commission and biotech companies like syngenta bayer and monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety as of update syngentas main competitors are monsanto company basf dow agrosciences bayer cropscience and dupont pioneer in  monsanto sought to acquire syngenta for a reported  billion but syngenta rejected the offer since april  monsanto and syngenta had been working with their investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs respectively on a deal the us treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion syngentas board of directors rejected an even better offer by monsanto during august  and monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on  august according to the swiss business weekly finanz und wirtschaft many syngenta shareholders were enraged both by the companys refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with monsanto and with the subsequent offer withdrawal this resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the alliance of critical syngenta shareholders which urged the board to evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice in a recent interview chairman michel demaré was asked whether syngenta could remain independent he responded if you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize then it would be possible but in these circumstances where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price what they think this company is worth it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months he thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold especially given industry consolidation which is creating larger competitors the failed monsanto buyout caused syngenta shares to increase by nearly  in february  chemchina a chinese stateowned enterprise offered to purchase syngenta for  billion  swiss francs per share a deal which the company unanimously recommended to shareholders” in april  the federal trade commission the committee on foreign investment in the united states and the european commissioner for competition approved of the acquisition allowing the largest foreign takeover in chinese history to proceed to secure approval chemchina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat abamectin and chlorothalonil as an additional condition for the acquisition  percent of the shareholders of syngenta had to offer their shares to chemchina according to a press release over  percent of shareholders agreed to the

in us and australian agriculture atrazine has been banned in the european union there has been controversy over atrazines effects on amphibians but the epa has concluded that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development the european commission decided to suspend use of the companys insecticide cruiser thiamethoxam tmx on crops pollinated by bees syngenta together with bayer is challenging this ban in court former productsedit syngentas predecessor cibageigy introduced the insecticide galecron chlordimeform in  and it was removed from the market in  in  cibageigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing longterm toxicology studies  particularly studies to determine if longterm exposure could cause cancer  showed that it was causing cancer and that it has already started to monitor its workers exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers– cibageigy then applied for and was granted permission to market galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton however as further long term monitoring data was obtained regulators banned chlordimeform in  in a  class action

greenville illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies the suit was settled for  million in may  a similar case involving six states has been in federal court since  in the us syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding viptera genetically modified corn the plaintiffs in nearly  states contend that syngentas introduction of viptera drove down us grain market prices leading to financial harm and that syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports before vipteras  introduction syngenta secured all us and ncgarecommended export approvals but none from china china had imported little to no us grain prior to  and at the time was not considered a major partner but it became a major partner in  when it dramatically increased us grain imports for three years china imported us viptera grain without formal approval in november  chinese officials destroyed a us grain shipment containing viptera grain started rejecting all us shipments with the gm grain but continued to accept it from all countries other than the us that same year us corn market prices

controversiesedit braziledit on  october  a brazilian peasant organization the landless workers movement portuguese movimento dos trabalhadores rurais sem terra  mst led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the companys seed research farms in protest against geneticallyengineered genetically modified vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate after the occupation had begun a team from nf security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued a protestor and a security guard were killed and some protesters and security guards were wounded the brazilian police investigation completed in november  blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of nf security the leader of mst was blamed for trespassing the inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg the security guard was shot in the head eight others were injured five of them landless the civil court of cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on  december  and on  june  the remaining mst members left the santa teresa site they had been occupying on  october  syngenta donated the

case in november  judge pedro ivo moreiro of the st civil court of cascavel ruled that syngenta must pay compensation to the family of valmir mota de oliveira keno who was killed in the attack and to isabel nascimento dos santos who was injured in his sentence the judge stated that to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality since … there is no doubt that in truth it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property the version of events put forward by syngenta was rejected by the court in may  syngenta was condemned by the iv permanent peoples tribunal for human rights violations in brazil conflict with tyrone hayesedit there has been a long running conflict between syngenta and university of california at berkeley biologist tyrone hayes according to an article in the  february  issue of the new yorker syngentas publicrelations team took steps to discredit hayes whose research is purported to suggest that the syngentaproduced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs the article states that the company paid thirdparty critics to write articles discrediting hayess work planned to have his wife investigated and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by hayes during a  february interview conducted on democracy now hayes reiterated the claims after the interview aired syngenta denied targeting hayes or making any threats calling those statements uncorroborated and intentionally damaging and demanding a retraction and public apology from hayes and democracy now in  syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the university of california berkeley complaining that hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing emails to syngenta scientists legal

jealotts hill near bracknell in  syngenta seeds purchased garst the north american corn and soybean business of advanta as well as golden harvest seeds on  december  the european union ended a sixyear moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by monsanto and its swiss rival syngenta in  syngenta opposed a swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms on  november  switzerland enacted a fiveyear ban on the farming of genetically modified crops underscoring the problems facing the european commission and biotech companies like syngenta bayer and monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety as of update syngentas main competitors are monsanto company basf dow agrosciences bayer cropscience and dupont pioneer in  monsanto sought to acquire syngenta for a reported  billion but syngenta rejected the offer since april  monsanto and syngenta had been working with their investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs respectively on a deal the us treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion syngentas board of directors rejected an even better offer by monsanto during august  and monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on  august according to the swiss business weekly finanz und wirtschaft many syngenta shareholders were enraged both by the companys refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with monsanto and with the subsequent offer withdrawal this resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the alliance of critical syngenta shareholders which urged the board to evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice in a recent interview chairman michel demaré was asked whether syngenta could remain independent he responded if you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize then it would be possible but in these circumstances where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price what they think this company is worth it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months he thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold especially given industry consolidation which is creating larger competitors the failed monsanto buyout caused syngenta shares to increase by nearly  in february  chemchina a chinese stateowned enterprise offered to purchase syngenta for  billion  swiss francs per share a deal which the company unanimously recommended to shareholders” in april  the federal trade commission the committee on foreign investment in the united states and the european commissioner for competition approved of the acquisition allowing the largest foreign takeover in chinese history to proceed to secure approval chemchina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat abamectin and chlorothalonil as an additional condition for the acquisition  percent of the shareholders of syngenta had to offer their shares to chemchina according to a press release over  percent of shareholders agreed to the

adversely affect amphibian gonadal development the european commission decided to suspend use of the companys insecticide cruiser thiamethoxam tmx on crops pollinated by bees syngenta together with bayer is challenging this ban in court former productsedit syngentas predecessor cibageigy introduced the insecticide galecron chlordimeform in  and it was removed from the market in  in  cibageigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing longterm toxicology studies  particularly studies to determine if longterm exposure could cause cancer  showed that it was causing cancer and that it has already started to monitor its workers exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers– cibageigy then applied for and was granted permission to market galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton however as further long term monitoring data was obtained regulators banned chlordimeform in  in a  class action

trademark office ruled in favor of syngenta which had filed a suit against bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides the following year syngenta filed suits against monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its us biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton in  it again filed a suit against monsanto claiming antitrust violations related to the us biotech corn seed market and monsanto countersued monsanto and syngenta settled all litigation in  syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of greenville illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies the suit was settled for  million in may  a similar case involving six states has been in federal court since  in the us syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding viptera genetically modified corn the plaintiffs in nearly  states contend that syngentas introduction of viptera drove down us grain market prices leading to financial harm and that syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports before vipteras  introduction syngenta secured all us and ncgarecommended export approvals but none from china china had imported little to no us grain prior to  and at the time was not considered a major partner but it became a major partner in  when it dramatically increased us grain imports for three years china imported us viptera grain without formal approval in november  chinese officials destroyed a us grain shipment containing viptera grain started rejecting all us shipments with the gm grain but continued to accept it from all countries other than the us that same year us corn market prices dropped  per bushel causing over b in losses with just over half of that loss occurring prior to chinas november rejection china later approved the gm corn in  but us corn grain market prices have not reboundedcitation needed syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial in kansas on june   and was ordered to pay the farmers  million however syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict controversiesedit braziledit on  october  a brazilian peasant organization the landless workers movement portuguese movimento dos trabalhadores rurais sem terra  mst led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the companys seed research farms in protest against geneticallyengineered genetically modified vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate after the occupation had begun a team from nf security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued a protestor and a security guard were killed and some protesters and security guards were wounded the brazilian police investigation completed in november  blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of nf security the leader of mst was blamed for trespassing the inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg the security guard was shot in the head eight others were injured five of them landless the civil court of cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on  december  and on  june  the remaining mst members left the santa teresa site they had been occupying on  october  syngenta donated the hectare station to the agronomy institute of paraná iapar for research into biodiversity recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems as well as environmental education programs court case in november  judge pedro ivo moreiro of the st civil court of cascavel ruled that syngenta must pay compensation to the family of valmir mota de oliveira keno who was killed in the attack and to isabel nascimento dos santos who was injured in his sentence the judge stated that to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality since … there is no doubt that in truth it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property the version of events put forward by syngenta was rejected by the court in may  syngenta was condemned by the iv permanent peoples tribunal for human rights violations in brazil conflict with tyrone hayesedit there has been a long running conflict between syngenta and university of california at berkeley biologist tyrone hayes according to an article in the  february  issue of the new yorker syngentas publicrelations team took steps to discredit hayes whose research is purported to suggest that the syngentaproduced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs the article states that the company paid thirdparty critics to write articles discrediting hayess work planned to have his wife investigated and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by hayes during a  february interview conducted on democracy now hayes reiterated the claims after the interview aired syngenta denied targeting hayes or making any threats calling those statements uncorroborated and intentionally damaging and demanding a retraction and public apology from hayes and democracy now in  syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the university of california berkeley complaining that hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing emails to syngenta scientists legal counsel from the university responded that hayes had acknowledged sending letters having unprofessional and offensive content and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future

syngentas main competitors are monsanto company basf dow agrosciences bayer cropscience and dupont pioneer in  monsanto sought to acquire syngenta for a reported  billion but syngenta rejected the offer since april  monsanto and syngenta had been working with their investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs respectively on a deal the us treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion syngentas board of directors rejected an even better offer by monsanto during august  and monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on  august according to the swiss business weekly finanz und wirtschaft many syngenta shareholders were enraged both by the companys refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with monsanto and with the subsequent offer withdrawal this resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the alliance of critical syngenta shareholders which urged the board to evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice in a recent interview chairman michel demaré was asked whether syngenta could remain independent he responded if you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize then it would be possible but in these circumstances where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price what they think this company is worth it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months he thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold especially given industry consolidation which is creating larger competitors the failed monsanto buyout caused syngenta shares to increase by nearly  in february  chemchina a chinese stateowned enterprise offered to purchase syngenta for  billion  swiss francs per share a deal which the company unanimously recommended to shareholders” in april  the federal

for  million in may  a similar case involving six states has been in federal court since  in the us syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding viptera genetically modified corn the plaintiffs in nearly  states contend that syngentas introduction of viptera drove down us grain market prices leading to financial harm and that syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports before vipteras  introduction syngenta secured all us and ncgarecommended export approvals but none from china china had
