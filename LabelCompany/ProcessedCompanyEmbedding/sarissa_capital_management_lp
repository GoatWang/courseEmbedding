weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

recommends that shareholders vote on sarissas gold proxy card for george bickerstaff and odysseas kostasglass lewis also recommends that shareholders vote against innovivas executive compensation news provided by sarissa capital management lp apr    et share this article greenwich conn april   prnewswire  sarissa capital management lp sarissa announced today that glass lewis an influential and leading independent proxy voting and corporate governance advisory firm announced its support for two of sarissas three nominees to the board of directors of innoviva inc nasdaq inva innoviva at its  annual meeting of stockholders to be held on april   at  am edt in philadelphia   glass lewis recommends that innoviva shareholders vote on the gold card for george bickerstaff and odysseas kostas glass lewis recommends that shareholders vote against innovivas executive compensation we urge all shareholders to read glass lewis thoughtful analysis which sheds light on many of the problems at innoviva in announcing its support for the sarissa nominees glass lewis concluded upon full review we believe sarissa has both provided a reasonable case for minority change to the incumbent board and submitted candidates who appear reasonably suited to address the concerns raised across sarissas materials  in turn we believe the board has offered a selectively structured unconvincing rebuke of material concerns surrounding innovivas climbing costs poor tsr performance dubious compensation practices and troubling corporate governance protocols in light of these considerable concerns we believe investors would benefit from a fresh shareholderfriendly perspective at the board level  emphasis added in discussing innovivas corporate governance issues including the nomgov committee process touted by innoviva that added patrick lepore and barbara duncan to the board glass lewis stated while we understand the board may view this framework as providing credibility to the process leading to the appointment of directors duncan and lepore we believe the overwhelming bulk of associated disclosure suggests a deeply flawed committee effort mired in among other things dubious meeting protocols poor member participation inclusion of nonmember directors and most disconcertingly the expansive involvement of the companys sitting ceo in short then we believe there is sufficient cause to suggest innovivas corporate governance architecture may be both faulty and reactive  emphasis added  glass lewis lists several problematic details of this process involving specific board members which we set forth later in this press release glass lewis described innoviva as a relatively simple enterprise revolving around gsk and stated in particular we find managements language supports the notion that the success or failure of innovivas products is effectively predicated on gsks marketing and sales programs which are in turn guided by committees over which gsk exerts de facto control thus we would argue the daytoday execution of an extant program heavily designed approved and exclusively implemented by gsk  rather than any active effort by innoviva management  is likely to be the axis around which innovivas growth and valuation turn  emphasis added glass lewis also expressed the following concerns regarding innovivas cost structure and benchmarking practices in short our considerable doubts about managements percentagebased methodology aside we are concerned innoviva  a firm with two principle products no research and development function and no sales staff  is benchmarking its expenses to firms with substantially more complex and diversified operational models  emphasis added glass lewis recommended that shareholders vote against innovivas executive compensation and stated given that the foregoing general and administrative cost architecture reflects among other things pay afforded to the companys senior executives it should arguably come as little surprise that we believe legitimate concerns exist with respect to innovivas compensation practices  emphasis added further troubling details of the nomgov process that added patrick lepore and barbara duncan to the board as accounted by glass lewis in discussing the nomgov committee process touted by innoviva that added patrick lepore and barbara duncan to the board glass lewis stated a closer look however raises additional questions around the effectiveness and independence of the committee  glass lewis then stated among other things we note the following notwithstanding a stated intention to identify candidates for review by the companys nominatingcorporate governance committee a substantial portion of the initial vetting appears to have been undertaken solely by former committee chair paul pepe in addition to mr pepes efforts key portions of the process are heavily marked by the participation of ceo michael aguiar as well as the bizarrely extensive inclusion of cathy friedman who is not a member of the nominating and corporate governance committee despite a process starting in may   the other two members of the committee  william waltrip and james tyree  were not expressly involved in the candidate evaluation and interview process until september   advice offered by external counsel regarding director appointments was not given to the full committee but instead only to mr pepe and ceo michael aguiar in the late stages of the process the chair of the committee  without any clear inclusion of messrs tyree or waltrip  reported to the full board regarding mr lepore on october   the committee held a nebulously defined concurrent meeting during a regularly scheduled board meeting leaving considerable ambiguity around the ability of all committee members  including members tyree and waltrip  to independently discuss thencandidate pepe in the subsequent process relating to ms duncan disclosure indicates that in lieu of full unambiguous support by all members of the nominating and corporate governance committee the plan to appoint ms duncan was instead supported by mr waltrip as a nonchair member of the committee cathy friedman a nonmember of the committee and michael aguiar innovivas ceo and on november   the committee held yet another concurrent meeting eventually resulting in among other things the appointment of ms duncan we believe glass lewis thorough and thoughtful analysis justifies its summation here we believe sarissa has presented a cogent case while much of innovivas materials attempt to frame the company as a lean enterprise critically and fruitfully involved in key aspects of the gsk collaboration agreements we consider a more detailed review indicates innoviva management has limited impact on the companys royalty streams in light of gsks marketing mandate and key veto authority  notwithstanding innovivas muted operational requirements the companys operational costs  which are principally comprised of executive compensation  have continually expanded in all cases while ordinary investors have suffered mediocre total returns relative to a benchmark index compounding our concern is a corporate governance framework that appears problematically malleable and largely ineffective in each case as an extension of the seemingly significant influence of current ceo michael aguiar as a result we are inclined to conclude sarissas current campaign represents an opportunity to replace a minority of the boards most culpable members with certain candidates we believe would bring suitable operational knowledge and financial discipline to innoviva sarissa strongly believes that innoviva must learn that shareholder capital must be optimized for the benefit of shareholders not management  we are gravely concerned about managements ability to be good stewards of future shareholder capital and its desires to build over time a recurring revenue business innoviva does not market or sell any drugs  it just collects royalties  so why is it spending so much money andwhy is it paying its management and directors so much  it is time for innoviva to be optimized for shareholders time is of the essence we urge you to vote the gold proxy card to help us deliver the necessary change to innoviva it is important that you submit your gold proxy card as soon as possible importantly if you receive a white card from innoviva do not return it just discard it if you want to follow glass lewis recommendation you must vote on the gold card and you cannot vote the white card  returning a white card even if you withhold on innovivas nominees will not be a vote for the sarissa nominees and it would revoke any vote you previously submitted on the gold card please vote now by signing dating and returning the gold proxy card  you may also vote by phone or internet by following the instructions on the gold proxy card  if you have any questions regarding your gold

of adding its own directors while itself flawed is very different than the perfunctory process that innoviva used to reject all sarissa nomineesinnoviva should release all documents requested by sarissas  letter to paint the true picture of their poor corporate governance news provided by sarissa capital management lp apr    et share this article greenwich conn april   prnewswire  sarissa capital management lp sarissa today made the following statement in connection with its intent to nominate a minority slate to the board of directors of innoviva inc nasdaq inva innoviva at its  annual meeting of stockholders to be held on april   at  am edt in philadelphia innovivas recent public statements reinforce our belief that innoviva misses the big picture – innoviva should be run for the benefit of shareholders not management  all shareholder money spent should be justified in order to maximize shareholder return innoviva recently boasted that it runs a lean structure that pays its employees nearly  million per year or  million per employee and has operating expenses of approximately  million per year or  million per employee  on this shoestring budget innovivas principal function is to staff two joint committees with gsk under an agreement that is structured in such a way to give innoviva no meaningful voice in its dealings with gsk  does innoviva therefore really believe that its joint committee tasks justify spending approximately  million per year or  million per employee and paying compensation of nearly  million per year or  million for each employee  we doubt gsk spends this much to staff these committees  sarissa asserts that innoviva too would spend much less but for one important fact – innoviva is not operated to maximize the return to shareholders  sarissa strongly believes that innoviva must learn that shareholder capital must be optimized for the benefit of shareholders not management  we are gravely concerned about managements ability to be good stewards of future shareholder capital innoviva is spending approximately  million per year or  million per employee to simply collect royalties  this sum is an outrageous amount of money for a company with such a simple business  innoviva claims that this level of spending which they consider lean is necessary due to its significant responsibilities on the joint committees and that innovivas help is critical to gsk for the commercial success of gsks respiratory products  these claims are simply not true innoviva has very little input and no control under the collaboration agreement  under the agreement gsk has overall responsibility for all development activities and has sole discretion with respect to all development decisions  the joint committee structure is nothing more than window dressing designed to ensure gsk remains in control  under the agreement if a committee has more than two disagreements in  months gsk thereafter controls all decisions for that committee for the life of the agreement other than to resolve commercial conflict issues if any arise  obviously this creates a huge disincentive to disagree with gsk  if innoviva disagrees with gsk more than twice in any year gsk gains a perpetual unilateral veto  innovivas involvement is not critical to gsks success  gsk has proven quite adept at selling respiratory products without innoviva  gsk successfully sold and marketed advair to peak sales of over  billion annually without innoviva  and even innoviva admits that it has no control over gsks marketing and sales efforts  so why is innoviva wasting all of this shareholder money without justifying each dollar spent innovivas purported process to add its own directors while itself flawed was very different than the perfunctory process undertaken by innoviva to summarily reject all sarissa nominees  innoviva proudly released a manufactured timeline showing all of the meetings and processes undertaken by the various board members in connection with their decision to add two director nominees sourced by a search firm engaged by the company  assuming the accuracy of this timeline it provides a stark contrast to the perfunctory process undertaken by the board when they summarily rejected all sarissa nominees  this timeline portrays a board interested in meeting and interviewing candidates sourced by the companys search firm at length before making an important decision  in contrast the nomgov committee had not even bothered to meet with sarissa or any of our nominees and the independent directors had scarcely interacted with any of us before it summarily rejected all sarissa nominees  it seems that nominees proposed by the company are taken much more seriously than nominees proposed by shareholders  how could chairman william waltrip and former nomgov chairman paul pepe reject our nominees without even meeting us innovivas process to add its own directors was itself terribly flawed  the search firm that found these candidates was engaged by the company instead of the nomgov committee members – william waltrip paul pepe and james tyree  this search firm reviewed candidates with the company instead of the nomgov committee and on that basis narrowed the choices for the board  the ceo instead of members of the nomgov committee reached out to patrick lepore who would later be added to the compensation committee about potential appointment to the board at the subsequent board meeting  bear in mind that innoviva has previously publicly disclosed that despite adding five new directors in the past three years the nomgov committee had only one meeting  of course after we pointed out this complete disregard for good corporate governance innoviva discovered three nomgov committee meetings  these facts reinforce our concerns about a poorly functioning nomgov committee and a company dominated by its ceo   innovivas practice of concurrent independent committee meetings raises several questions  the nomgov committee recommended directors to the board during concurrent board meetings  does this mean that during a full board meeting the nomgov committee took action required to be taken by independent directors only  we ask innoviva  was the ceo present during these concurrent meetings  if so do you think this is appropriate innoviva continues to withhold documents under our  request  in response to our  request under delaware law we were able to obtain documents from innoviva that while heavily redacted and only partially responsive reinforced our belief that innoviva is fraught with bad corporate governance and dominated by its ceo  unfortunately innoviva continues to prohibit us from freely sharing these documents with our fellow stockholders  as we do not believe innoviva has any legitimate basis to withhold these documents we are seeking court approval to share them with our fellow stockholders  we urge innoviva to provide us with all of the information we requested and to allow us to release what limited heavily redacted materials were provided innovivas criticism of sarissas nominees is misguided  our nominees have extensive financial healthcare and pharmaceutical experience having held senior executive andor director positions at numerous companies  most importantly our nominees understand that shareholder capital must be optimized for the benefit of shareholders not management  we are confident that our nominees will work hard to ensure that innoviva is no longer run for the benefit of management but for the benefit of shareholders george bickerstaff iii and jules haimovitz recently oversaw during their tenure on the board of ariad pharmaceuticals a stock price increase from  to  or   this dramatic increase in shareholder value was driven by smart capital allocation decisions and a focus on operational excellence which put the company in a position to be sold for a substantial premium  why does innoviva ignore the recent success of these nominees and the value that they can add to the board innovivas continued criticism of enzon during the board tenures of alex denner and odysseas kostas is a distortion of the facts  enzons revenue and expenses declined due to the sale of assets and the suspension of clinical development activities after failed clinical trials failed clinical trials are a common occurrence in biotech  enzon was left with royalty revenues that were expected to decline due to royalty expirations and changing dynamics in the hepatitis c market  enzon further reduced expenses to conserve capital and maximize value returned to stockholders  today as a public company enzon continues to collect royalty revenues returning capital to stockholders and spending less than  million annually including compensation to management and directors  we ask that innoviva stockholders reach out to large stockholders of enzon  sarissa believes that investors will appreciate the difference between a company run for the benefit of shareholders enzon versus one run for the benefit of management innoviva innoviva does not market or sell any drugs  it just collects royalties so why is it spending so much money andwhy is it paying its management and directors so much  it is time for innoviva to be optimized for shareholders time is of the essence we urge you to vote the gold proxy card to help us deliver the necessary change to innoviva it is important that you submit your gold proxy card as soon as possible importantly if you receive a white card

 prnewswire  sarissa capital management lp sarissa today made the following statement in connection with its intent to nominate a minority slate to the board of directors of innoviva inc inva innoviva at its  annual meeting of stockholders to be held on april   at  am edt in philadelphia pasarissa feels the need to respond to a few of innovivas untrue and misleading claims in its proxy materialsinnovivas claim that sarissa has not made a serious attempt to engage constructively with innovivas board and management team is not true in fact the opposite is true sarissa has been rebuffed in its attempts to have an active dialogue with independent directors at innoviva in fact in the middle of discussions with the company innoviva suddenly filed proxy materials rejecting all of our nominees and claiming incorrectly that we want to take control of the board innoviva later explained to sarissa that it filed those proxy materials to maintain its original timeline for the annual meeting a choice which is unnecessary under delaware lawsarissas interactions with innoviva over the last two weeks best exemplify the untrue nature of innovivas claims sarissa includes a timeline below of such communicationsinnovivas claim that sarissa wants to take effective control of the board is also not true as we disclosed in our preliminary proxy statement we are not seeking control of the board but much needed stockholder representation with a minority slate of three nominees the board is set at seven directors   for investors less familiar with nuances of delaware law according to innovivas bylaws we would not have been able to unilaterally add potential nominees after the february   deadline therefore our notice of nomination in advance of the february   deadline and prior to submitting our preliminary proxy included four potential nominees however in that notice sarissa expressly indicated that sarissa could nominate fewer than four nominees sarissa also informed innoviva of this fact and that sarissa may not seek to replace any innoviva incumbent directors on several occasions before innoviva filed its preliminary proxy innovivas claim that its marketing and executive leadership play a critical role in the growth of revenue for the respiratory products commercialized by gsk is not believable to sarisssa as innoviva has admitted in its k  we have no control over gsks marketing and sales efforts… we agree with innoviva that after a sluggish launch of products by gsk gsk has dramatically improved its commercial efforts sarissa however does not believe innovivas marketing and executive leadership play a critical role in the growth of the respiratory products given gsks success in selling and marketing respiratory products including advair without innovivainnoviva correctly reports that it provided sarissa with some records that sarissa requested in its demand letter pursuant to section  but neglects to share that what it provided is only a portion of what we requested and was heavily redacted and that the company has not let us freely share what we found with any other stockholders sarissa is troubled by what was found and will seek the full scope of what was initially requested and for the ability to share this information with other stockholdersinnovivas characterization of the history at enzon pharmaceuticals inc enzon is misleading revenue and expenses declined due to the sale of assets including research assets and the suspension of clinical development activities enzon was then left with royalty revenues much as innoviva is today enzon further reduced expenses to conserve capital and maximize value returned to stockholders and today manages royalties with a lean cost structure  royalty revenues have declined due to expirations of royalties and due to changing dynamics in the hepatitis c market today as a public company enzon continues to collect royalty revenues returning capital to stockholders and spending less than  million annually including compensation to management and directors sarissa strongly believes that innoviva must learn that shareholder capital must be optimized for the benefit of shareholders instead of managementinnoviva does not market or sell any drugs  it just collects royalty payments  so why is it spending so much money and why is management being paid so much  it is time for innoviva to be optimized for shareholdersbelow sarissa shares with fellow stockholders a detailed timeline of the communications between sarissa and innoviva to
