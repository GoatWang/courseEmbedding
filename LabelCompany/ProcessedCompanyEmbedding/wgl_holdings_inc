spokane tyler tjomsland  the spokesmanreview by chad sokol chadsospokesmancom  twitter facebook  email  reddit  sms it was perhaps only a matter of time before avista corp agreed to sell to a neighbor from the north large canadian power companies have been snapping up smaller american ones for several years paying tens of billions of dollars to expand their geographic footprint into a country that offers lighter regulations and higher returns on investment torontobased hydro one’s  billion pending purchase of avista announced wednesday follows major acquisitions by canadian companies enbridge inc transcanada corp fortis inc and algonquin power  utilities corp each of those deals catapulted the buyer into the leading ranks of north american utilities if the avista purchase passes regulatory muster – a process that may take up to a year – hydro one’s assets will total  billion with the industry consolidating a bloomberg report about a year ago placed avista on a list of a dozen us utilities that would be likely acquisition targets in terms of size avista is ranked th of  publicly traded utilities in the us said scott morris the company’s chairman president and chief executive officer also on that bloomberg list was wgl holdings inc a washington dcbased utility holding company that announced in january it’s being acquired by calgarybased altagas ltd for  billion like other canadian buyers seeking stable investments hydro one was willing to pay a premium for avista the allcash deal includes the assumption of avista’s  billion debt on wednesday bloomberg reported that the price was too high for some analysts with hydro one paying about  times avista’s earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization more than the  average multiple for comparable deals avista’s shareholders stand to receive  per share about  percent higher than wednesday’s closing rate “that would be the highest premium paid for any company in the electric space today so we think we did a nice job for shareholders” morris said in an interview thursday morris was vague when asked whether avista initiated the acquisition talks with hydro one or if there had been other offers on the table he said only that a number of companies had inquired about potential deals over the past year and a half “i wouldn’t say ‘offers’ because we were never for sale” he said “we never put ourselves up for sale” morris said even with rate increases it has been challenging to cover the cost of replacing decadesold power poles and transmission lines while developing new technology for a “st century grid” “for  years all of the investments that we made were pipes and wires and transmission lines and generation facilities” he said “very expensive capital projects but you could spread and depreciate the cost over    years so it worked really well you didn’t have to have quite the scale” now he said “most utilities are consolidating because it’s a lot easier to spread those costs” over a wider customer base hydro one has about  million customers in rural ontario and avista has about  customers in eastern washington north idaho and parts of oregon and alaska morris also said the combined companies could get “more bang for our buck” when purchasing materials in  ontario’s ombudsman called on hydro one to “overhaul its corporate culture” after his office received more than  complaints from ratepayers about overbilling and estimated bills the ombudsman andré marin said the company provided “outrageously bad customer service” as it scrambled to fix technical glitches in its billing system according to the cbc morris said he was unconcerned about the billing issue which arose months before mayo schmidt took over as hydro one’s ceo the problem also resulted in a  million class action lawsuit which is still being litigated and the company says the glitches were quickly fixed “they installed their new customer billing system much like we did” morris said “unfortunately for them – it was before mayo’s time – it didn’t go very well they made some mistakes it was tough technology … they are making it right with people” morris also stressed that the acquisition would have no effect on electricity rates or jobs and that it would more than double avista’s charitable giving “our intentions were to make sure that this gem of a company stayed a gem of a company with local control local management making local decisions for the right reasons for our customers” he said “in many ways we have locked in our values our culture” editor’s note this story

partially lighted with gas in citation needed in  when a gas company for washington remained only a proposal a us senate document argued for gas salutary effect on the local economy fancy and other stores would introduce this light and thus add to the cheerfulness of the public wayscitation needed among the early proponents of gas was james crutchett who bought a house north of the capitol grounds and lit it with gas this drew the attention of congress which voted him  to light up the capitol and helped encourage public support for wider use of gas a supporter of crutchetts ideas was benjamin b french chief clerk of the house of representatives who helped attract other important supporters including william a bradley the citys postmaster and mayor john f callan a druggist his brother michael p callan a post office clerk hardware merchant william h harrover william h english a treasury clerk who became a congressman from indiana and later a vicepresidential candidate and jacob bigelow an attorney and abolitionist who later helped escaped slave ann maria weems two petitions were sent to congress in april  and on july  of that year lawmakers issued the first congressional charter for a company that would extract gas from coalcitation needed at last the nations capital had its first gas company the washington gas light company the company was established on the tenth street of the foggy bottom neighborhood and eventually led to the areas urbanizationcitation needed edit george washington riggs became the president of the company in  two years later the company began to build a new more efficient factory the west station works between th and g streets nw meanwhile a new plant was constructed in foggy bottom in  at the intersection of new hampshire and virginia avenues nw this location at the head of the chesapeake and ohio canal gave it access to barges carrying coal from west virginia and pennsylvania these plants changed the neighborhood between  and  the percentage of skilled laborers in the foggy bottom neighborhood declined from  to  while the percentage of unskilled laborers rose to   during the american civil war coal and transportation grew scarce “the cost of making gas increased one hundred and twentyfive percent and another problem appeared when congress reduced the gas rate seventeen percent” the company sought help from the secretary of war and from president abraham lincoln who he wrote to john w garrett president of the baltimore and ohio railroad asking him to “bring coal to the city and afford the continuation of the necessary gas lighting” production levels for gas went down during the civil war they soon returned to normal in the s several large holding tanks gasometers were erected at the foggy bottom site in  thomas edison introduced the incandescent lamp a threat to the company in  one of the gasometers exploded the cause was attributed to a large storm th centuryedit gas
