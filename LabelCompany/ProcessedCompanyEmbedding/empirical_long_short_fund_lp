hedge funds chosen at random from those which applied the equity long only strategy in the examined periodjel classification g g g keywords hedge funds investmentsintroductiontraditional investments like stocks or bonds results are compared to certain benchmarks that are usually stock or bond indexes this kind of approach is not used by hedge funds managers in this case the aim of an investment is not to achieve the rate of income better than the market but an absolute and attractive rate of income no matter what the situation on the global financial market is these institutions should be characterized by the risk directly deriving from the strategy used by them not from the market situation the factor that differentiates a hedge fund from other hedge funds is the level of alpha coefficientsj brown wn goetzmann and rg ibbotson examined the offshore hedge fund industry over the period  through  using a database that includes both defunct and currently operating funds they come to the conclusion that the industry is characterized by high attrition rates and low covariance with the us stock market besides offshore funds as a group have positive riskadjusted performance when measured by sharpe ratios and by jensen’s alpha  interdisciplinary management research v they also point that little public information is available about the investment strategies and specialization of these mangers as it is shown beneath the author’s conclusions about hedge funds performance differ from this research they let assume that hedge funds are no longer as good tools for making money as they used to be a few years ago the aim and the scope of the research the research presented in the paper was done on the basis of  hedge funds that use equity long only strategies they were chosen at random from the data base prepared by barclayhedge and global fund technologies which comprises about  hedge funds applying different investment strategies the aim of the research is to measure the investments results of hedge funds in  and  that is during the bull and the bear market the sp index was used as a benchmark it was shown that the majority of institutions whose aim is to generate absolute rates of return and what refers to it generating better rates of return than traditional investments irrespective of the market situation thus also during the bear market broke this rule such measures were taken into consideration as rates of return risk measured by standard deviation risk measured by beta the level of alpha the correlation of the examined funds with traditional assets and the sharpe ratiogiven the fact that the paper was prepared at the end of  data from january  until november  were taken into consideration it let examine the results of hedge funds both during favorable market conditions and during the bear market on global financial markets in the first part of the paper the author gives the detailed characteristics of investment strategies used by the examined hedge funds hedge funds investment results measurement – focus on theory all hedge funds claim to do something highly exclusive and proprietary and anxiously guard their trading secrets although transparency has improved with the arrival of institutional investors hedge fund investors are seldom told what exactly goes on inside the black box as a result it can sometimes be very hard to properly assess the riskreturn characteristics of a fund apart from standard characteristics like rates of return standard deviation correlation hedge funds’ performance is usually measured by beta and alpha the overall measure used in this industry is the sharpe ratio which covers both risk and rates of return the paper does not concentrate on the idea of these measures however the  for details

school city of london november   p  interdisciplinary management research v author will give a brief point on the most important things concerning beta and alpha so as to make the empirical results more understandable in a nutshell beta is a measure of a fund’s amount of dependence on the return of the market the concept is rooted in portfolio theory pioneered by harry markowitz in the s which has evolved to express the relationship between risky assets such as stocks and the market tran   hedge funds offer three types of beta benefits gregoriou et al   •traditional beta benefits emanating from exposure to stock and bond returns•beta benefits emanating from exposure to other risk factors in equity markets such as smallcap versus largecap spread value versus growth spread or implied volatility and in bond markets such as term spread credit spread or bond returns volatility •other alternate beta benefits such as commodity price levels or currency rates the beta measure is connected with a risk premium that is a part of the capmhedge funds are supposed to be free from the market free from its vagaries and fluctuations and risks the values of their beta are supposed to be very low or near zero for a fund manager to achieve such a feat he or she must have exceptional skills or talent that is why alpha is often claimed to be synonymous with a portfolio manager’s talent or skills hedge funds assets and investment strategies the examined hedge funds have various amount of assets under management see chart  it is worth emphasizing at the beginning that one of the funds ie ramius value  opportunity fund ltd does not reveal the amount of assets under its management so it can not be taken into consideration in this analysis the biggest assets out of the

our buy disciplines the sell disciplines are designed to identify points in time when the riskreward relationship over an intermediate time frame becomes unfavorable changes in the riskreward
