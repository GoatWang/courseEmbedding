us understanding reits the history of reits congress created reits in  to enable small investors to make investments in largescale incomeproducing real estate equity reits and to participate in the financing of real estate mortgage reits for years commercial real estate was almost entirely owned by private investors including partnerships pension funds and wealthy individuals in addition most properties were financed primarily with debt which traditionally came from pension funds insurance companies commercial banks and savings and loan institutions congress decided that the only way for the average investor to access investments in significant commercial properties was through pooling arrangements as a result they designed reits to unite the capital of many into a single economic enterprise that enterprise is geared to the production of income through commercial real estate ownership or through the financing of real estate properties what can reits do a reit is a company dedicated to owning and in most cases operating incomeproducing real estate such as apartments shopping centers offices and warehouses some reits like united mortgage trust also are engaged in financing real estate most importantly to be a reit a company is legally required to pay virtually all of its taxable income  percent to its shareholders every year in short a reit may deduct the dividends paid to the shareholders from its corporate tax bill so long as the company’s assets are primarily composed of real estate held for the long term the company’s income is mainly derived from real estate and  the company pays out at least  percent of its taxable income to shareholders  benefits to shareholders property and loans are more liquid reits have helped turn real estate liquid through the public reit marketplace investors can buy and sell interests in diversified portfolios of properties or mortgages as well as the management associated with them – on an instantaneous basis illiquidity the bane of real estate investors is gone lower risk assets because real property and mortgage loans generally have a long life during which they have the potential to produce income investors always have viewed this as an investment option with security now through reits small investors have an added level of security never available before in real estate investment investors look to high dividend paying stocks both to provide income and to reduce the monthtomonth changes in the value of their investment portfolios that come from more volatile assets portfolio diversification investing in reits and other publicly traded real estate companies also provides diversification benefits because correlation of reit returns with returns of other market sectors is relatively low required distributions reits are required by law to distribute each year to their shareholders at least  percent of their taxable income putting reits among those companies paying the highest dividends individual investors that are retired or approaching retirement often seek investments that provide appreciable and dependable sources of income younger investors also may seek incomeproducing investments as part of their strategy for reducing the volatility and protecting the value of their portfolios reit dividends help to stabilize the value of individual stock portfolios because the contractual rental income or mortgage payment from their assets is similar to the interest payment on bonds for more info umt investor relations toll free   direct   fax   email
