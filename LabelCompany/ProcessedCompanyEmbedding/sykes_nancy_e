get under our skin like nancy we heart nancy shes complex sympathetic and totally tragic were not even going to mess around with silly fibs about cutting onions or being allergic to dust our cheeks were wet when nancy died because we were bawling our eyes outyoung girl old soulnancy might be the most complicated character of the novel despite being a relatively minor character she has a very important role to play—she’s the source of the information about the plot between monks and fagin to ensnare oliverwhy does she help oliver what’s the turning point for her well that’s what’s so complicated she seems to be reminded of her own lost innocence when she looks at oliver soon after oliver is stolen back from mr brownlow’s house she jumps to his defense for the first time and yells at fagin i thieved for you when i was a child not half as old as oliver i have been in the same trade and in the same service for twelve years since don’t you know it speak out dont you know it  it’s also important to note that dickens never – not once – uses the word prostitute or whore to describe either bet or nancy this is the closest he comes and it’s through sikes who asks nancy if she knows who and what she is the implication is pretty obvious – she’s a prostitute and therefore hardly a moral person to take oliver under her wing—but dickens never comes out and says it why is that dickens doesn’t shy away from showing the grisly murder in all its gory detail or from describing thefts and frauds and other crimes is it just victorian sexual repression that keeps him from saying that nancy is a prostitute that could be part of it after all dickens wants his audience to feel sympathy for nancy by the end and a victorian reader might object to feeling sympathy for a whorepride love and fate the triple threatwhen nancy meets with rose alone and then with rose and mr brownlow at the bridge she has to make a difficult choice they offer her a safe passage to a foreign country where she could live in peace and solitude far from her old life and secure from fagin sikes and the others she’s terrified of sikes and loathes fagin so why does she say no is it pride does she not want to take handouts from them maybe earlier in the novel before her first conversation with rose we’re told that pride is the vice of the lowest and most debased creature no less than of the high and selfassured  so okay—it could be prideor is it love she tells rose that it is at the end of their first meeting she explainswhen such as me who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place that parents home and friends filled once or that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to cure us sounds like a pretty appalling version of love but sure—that could be it or is it fate with a capital f nancy seems to think so at their final meeting—she says i am chained to my old life i loathe and hate it now but i cannot leave it i must have gone too far to turn back … 7 this idea of having gone too far to turn back seems pretty much in keeping with the rest of the novel—once you turn down the wrong path there’s no turning back even if it means returning to your violent and menacing lover only to be brutally murdered this novel seems to take a pretty bleak view of forgiveness and redemption despite the apparent hopefulness of the final lines and well never really forgive dickens for killing nancy offnancy timeline  back next   cite this page logging out…

lit glossary table of contents shmoop premium oliver twist introduction or browse other shmoopers questions in a nutshell please sir i want some morethese are words etched in our imagination if we want just a little teensy bit more of something—coffee chicken tenders cash—we tend to remember the superpathetic plea of a little orphan in englandwait why are we as sophisticated st century citizens still using a line penned in the s when we want a second helping the short answer charles dickens is awesomeoliver twist is one of the most famous novels charles dickens ever wrote which is impressive given that he wrote fifteen superpopular novels during his life it’s a classic ragstoriches story about an orphan who has to find his way through a city full of criminals and avoid being corrupted people read oliver twist in dickenss day—and are still reading it now—for the gritty realism with which dickens portrays working class people and the horrible living conditions of the london slumsoliver twist is also the second novel dickens ever wrote and it was published in installments between 7 and  many novels at the time were published serially meaning that each chapter was issued separately once a month over the space of a year or two and this only upped the hype of his novelsthe publishing of novels in magazines is similar to tv today each magazine was like a different channel the victorians had magazines with different specialties  bentley’s miscellany was like an early victorian hbo—it pushed the envelope in terms of the type of content that could be published and a lot of prominent novelists and essayists started out writing for bentley’s including our man charles dickens—he started writing the monthly installments of oliver twist before he’d even finished writing his first novel the pickwick papers     but while the pickwick papers was all fun and games twist was dark and gritty oliver twist is an example of a style of novel that was incredibly popular but widely criticized from the s to the s the newgate novel the newgate novel takes its name from the newgate prison the main prison for felons pickpockets thieves prostitutes murderers in london those newgate novels sold like hotcakes it seemed like folks couldn’t get enough of them but the critics of the newgate novels thought they were damaging english morals because the newgate novels didn’t shy away from depicting criminal stuff—prostitution stealing and even murder—critics said that reading those novels would desensitize people to violence hmm sounds an awful lot like the arguments you hear today against firstperson shooter video games or games like grand theft auto doesn’t it the next time someone criticizes your taste in videogames you can try suggesting that if dickens were alive today he might have tried his hand at writing a shooteroliver twist is dickens’s only novel that qualifies as a newgate novel though so it seems like he just wanted to try his hand at the popular style of writing before turning to other loftier pursuits we’re certainly happy that he experimented with the newgate genre because we’re left with the totally entertaining fruits of that experiment  as well as the catchphrase please sir i want some more   why should i care psst hey hey shmooper over hereyou look like the kind of person who enjoys literary journeys into the underbelly of society you look like kind of person who gets a thrill from texts about the mob or from nefarious deeds committed in dark alleys by men with ominous mustaches were betting you like the really good stuff the premium stuff and by stuff we mean tv obviously yeah we bet you like amc and hbo meth cooks in new mexico haunted detectives gradea antiheroes well how would you like to get your kicks with one of the texts that started this whole seedy trendpeople tend to think of oliver twist as an old book about a cherubic orphan but in reality its way more creeptastic and peripheral than that its about a cherubic orphan sure but its really about the worst possible environment for our sweet lil oliver the original mean streets of londontown and the people that populated themmurderers pickpockets prostitutes pimps beggars drunks schemers loners dreamers criminals these are the characters at the heart of oliver twist—the same cast that shows up every sunday night on tv we love them now and we loved them back in the s in fact oliver twists original serialized form made reading the book way back when a lot like tuning in for your favorite cable mayhem today and you know what it holds up even for audiences jaded by too much true detective oliver twist hits the sweet spot that we know and love the union of sleazy abjection and great art or browse other shmoopers questions
