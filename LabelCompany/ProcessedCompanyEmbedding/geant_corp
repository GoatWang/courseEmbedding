one year including costs associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the sec we know that there are a number of obstacles to entering the market of dung paper items and the competition is rather high there are several companies poopoopaper haathi chaap and ecomaximus that offer comparative items and we will have to compete with them we see the main competitive advantage of our competitors in the established customer base and marketing outlets howbeit we arranged on a wholesale exchange for the most part so we will have capacity to offer our item for extensive organizations in huge amount so our item is more extensive and quality is better ways to deal with business are more flexible one of our biggest competitive advantages is that our item is raw material for different companies so we would have a major measure of delivering item at the brief timeframe some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows  number of competitors increase different companies may follow our business model of distributing high quality paper items made from elephant dung which will reduce our competitive edge  price our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell our product at loss  substitute products ompetitors may substitute items made from elephant dung with comparable items made from dung of some other animals company description we were incorporated in the state of nevada on february   we just recently started our operations our business is the production of paper made from elephant dung poo for making different stationery products and distribution thereof primarily in shri lanka  we will disperse our items in shri lanka and neighboring countries we plan to use various distribution channels for various types of customers as a rule we arrenged for a wholesale exchange however in future we can make some items for various traveler shops and kiosks corporate customers and individual customers will be covered by our web page and targeted marketing exercises geant corp’s business is in making unique products to be sold to both massmarket customers and individual clients in future we want to focus on something that is socially and environmentally responsible so we are contributing to the solution and not adding to the problem we want to work with something that had more meaning to us something we could be passionate about and that possibly could have an important social statement attached to it all of our paper products are  recycled they do not have any smell they are made up of  fiber from elephant dung and  post consumer paper all papers everywhere are made from a pulp mixture derived from fiber materials the most common papers today come from wood fiber pulp from cut trees our fibers of choice of course are dung fibers we use the dung fibers from elephants to make our dung paper products all elephants that generate the dung that we require for our process have at least two things in common  all are herbivores and have highly fibrous diets of different plants and vegetation  all possess inefficient digestive systems that do not completely digest and breakdown all the fibers that they eat this results in a significant amount of fibers remaining intact when these animals dung there are no toxic chemicals used in our paper making process natural vegetative binding agents along with watersoluble salt dyes for coloring are used our dung papers are handmade acid free and as organic as it gets we are focused on the production of dung paper for massmarket customers to give them the ability of making different stationery products souvenirs touristoriented products upmarket gifts and interior design items from natural products on advanced and unique designs it would be easier for them to buy raw materials paper from us to produce needed products instead of making paper it is easier for us at the beginning to set up the production of paper instead of setting up the whole paper production and of different kinds of stationery products at the same time in the future we have plans about production of some additional stationery items aside from paper geant corp has the ability to product handmade dung paper for making such original items as for example  bags  frames  photo albums  notebooks  stationery  cards however first we intend to launch a mass production of inexpensive handmade dung paper for making different stationery products and various tourist souvenirs which were

regarding forwardlooking statements   the data contained in this prospectus including the documents consolidated by reference into this prospectus incorporates a few proclamations that are not simply verifiable or do not identify with present actualities or conditions which might be considered as forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements incorporate yet are not restricted to proclamations with respect to our company and administration’s desires trusts convictions aims or techniques in regards to the future including our budgetary standing consequences of operations and the normal effect of the offering on the gatherings’ individual and consolidated money related execution moreover any announcements that allude to projections conjectures or different portrayals of future occasions or circumstances including any hidden suspicions are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “continue” “could” “estimates” “expects” “intends” “may” “might” “plans” “possible” “potential” “predicts” “projects” “seeks” “should” “will” “would” and comparative expressions or the negatives of such terms may recognize forwardlooking statements yet the nonappearance of these words does not imply that an announcement is not forwardlooking   the forwardlooking statements contained in this prospectus depend on current desires and convictions concerning future improvements and the potential impacts on the gatherings and the exchange there can be no confirmation that future advancements really influencing us will be those foreseen these forwardlooking statements include various dangers vulnerabilities some of which are past the gatherings’ control or different suspicions that may bring about genuine results or execution to be tangibly unique in relation to those communicated or inferred by these forwardlooking statements   risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business performance and financial standing could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment          risks relating to our business   we have limited operating history and have maintained losses since inception which we expect to continue into the future   we were incorporated on february   and have limited operations we have generated no revenues our net loss from inception to may   is    based upon our proposed plans we expect to incur significant operating losses in future periods this will happen because there are substantial costs and expenses associated with the development marketing and distribution of our product we may fail to generate revenues in the future if we cannot attract a significant number of customers we will not be able to generate any significant revenues or income failure to generate revenues will cause us to obtain funding under the verbal agreement concluded with mr sudusinghe  which is filed as exhibit  the amount of the verbal agreement is    in particular additional capital may be required in the case if           the actual expenditures required to be made are at or above the higher range of our estimated expenditures           we incur unexpected costs in completing the development of our business or encounter any unexpected difficulties           we incur delays and additional expenses related to the production of our product or a commercial market for our product or           we are unable to create a substantial market for our product or we incur any significant unanticipated expenses   the case of any of the previously stated occasions could substantially unfavorably influence our capacity to meet our strategies for success and accomplish a beneficial level of operations   some of the existing companies that engage in application of dung products and sales thereof have a greater more established outlet than us   there are couple of hindrances of passage in the assembling and offer of keepsakes from dung endowments and other handcrafted items one of them being rivalry which is not extremely high but still substantial  there are a few companies offering the same sort of items among these one should mention the poopoopaper poopoopapercom  ecomaximus ecomaximuscom  and haathi chaap  elephantpoopapercom  we will be in direct competition with them since they have some years of experience these companies have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers many of these companies may have a greater more established customer base than us    we have no revenues and our ability to sustain our operations is dependent on our ability to rise financing our independent registered public accountant has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   we have incurred net losses of  for the period from our inception on february   to may   and have no revenues our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations in the production and distribution of our products further the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth we do however anticipate that we will require approximately  over the next  months in order to continue operations these factors raise doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern auditor george stewart cpa our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise if we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed we plan to receive an interestfree loan from suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe otherwise we will not be able to complete our business plan you should consider our independent registered public accountant’s report when determining if an investment in geant corp is suitable   we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount we will obtain funding under the verbal agreement concluded with mr sudusinghe  which is filed as exhibit  the amount of the verbal agreement is         because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations the effect of the recent economic crisis may impact our business performance or financial standing   the recent global crisis has caused disruption and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and has impacted levels of consumer spending one of the core markets for our products is the tourist hence success of our business depends greatly on how these macroeconomic developments may affect the tourism industry a slow or uneven pace of economic recovery would negatively affect our ability to start our production and distribution business and obtain financing   further main raw materials for our products are currently procured from indian elephant orphanage and there should not be an interruption in the supply of raw materials so we can product our product without any delay   by any force major сircumstances the number of tourists who come to shri lanka will decrease   there could be some natural disaster or any other forse major circumstances that can affect on tourism industry due to the fact we depend on the number of coming tourists this factor may affect on the number of our sales a slowdown of number of coming tourists would negatively affect on our business   if elephants got sick or they could endanger on the health of tourists all these would affect on our business   elephants can get sick and because of that their dung our raw material сould be unfit for the production furthermore elephants can be carriers of disease that can have bad influence on the health of people this can affect on the number of coming tourists therefore on the number of sales   we operate in a competitive environment and if we are unable to compete with our competitors our business financial standing cash flows and prospects could be materially affected   we operate in a competitive environment our competition includes several midsized companies with similar products who manufacture and distribute at competitive prices poopoopaper ecomaximus haathi chaap this competitive environment could materially adversely affect our business financial standing cash flows and prospects   because we will order our secondary materials for production from overseas a disruption in the delivery of imported products may have a greater effect on us than on our competitors   we will import main raw materials from india and subsidiary raw materials from china therefore we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who product andor warehouse products in shri lanka deliveries of our subsidiary raw materials may be disrupted through factors such as    raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest  fuel price increases  problems with ocean shipping including work stoppages and shipping  container shortages  increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments and  economic crises international disputes and wars   some of our competitors warehouse products they import from overseas which allow them to continue delivering their products for the near term despite overseas shipping disruptions if our competitors are able to deliver products when we cannot our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers to our competitors   price competition could negatively affect our gross margins          price competition could negatively affect our operating results to respond to competitive pricing pressures  we will have to offer our products at lower prices in order to retain or gain market share and customers if our competitors offer discounts on products in the future we will need to lower prices to match the competition which could adversely affect our gross margins and operating results   because our sole officer and director owns  of the company’s shares and will own  or more of our outstanding common stock upon completing this offering he will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders   as of the date of this prospectus mr sudusinghe our sole officer and director owns  of the company’s shares and will own  of our common stock if all of the shares registered as part of this offering are sold as a result he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr sudusinghe may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders   if suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe our current sole officer and director should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer which could result in the cessation of our operation if that should happen you could lose your investment   we extremely depend on the services of our sole officer and director suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe for the future success of our business the loss of the services of suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe could have an adverse effect on our business performance and financial standing if he should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer if that should occur until we find another person to act as our chief executive officer our operations could be suspended in that case it is possible you could lose your entire investment   because our principal assets are located outside of the united states and suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe our sole director and officer resides outside of the united states it may be difficult for an investor to enforce any right based on us federal securities laws against us andor mr sudusinghe or to enforce a judgment rendered by a united states court against us or mr sudusinghe   our principal operations and assets are located outside of the united states and suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe our sole officer and director is a nonresident of the united states therefore it may be difficult to effect service of process on mr sudusinghe in the united states and it may be difficult to enforce any judgment rendered against mr sudusinghe  accordinly it may be difficult or impossible for an investor to bring an action against mr sudusinghe in the case that an investor believes that such investor’s rights have been infringed under the us securities laws or otherwise even if an investor is successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of shri lanka may render that investor as unable to enforce a judgment against the assets of mr sudusinghe as a result our shareholders may have more difficulties in protecting their interests through actions against our management director or major shareholder compared to shareholders of a corporation doing business and whose officers and directors reside within the united states   further since our assets are located outside the united states they will be outside of the jurisdiction of united states courts to administer if we become subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding accordin g ly if we declare bankruptcy or insolvency our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the united states under united states bankruptcy laws   because we do not have an escrow or trust account for your subscription if we file for bankruptcy protection or are forced into bankruptcy or a creditor obtain a judgment against us and attaches the subscription you will lose your investment          your funds will not be placed in an escrow trust or similar account as nevada law does not require that funds raised pursuant to the sale of securities be placed into an escrow account  as a result if we file for bankruptcy protection or creditors against us file a petition for involuntary bankruptcy your funds will become a part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws if creditor sues us and obtains a judgment against us the creditor could garnish the bank account and take possession of the subscriptions if that happens you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors   you may not renounce your membership understanding once it is acknowledged by the company or get a discount of any assets progressed regarding your acknowledged membership ascension and therefore you may lose all or a portion of your interest in our common stock   once your subscription agreement is accepted by the company you may not revoke the agreement or request a refund of any monies paid in connection with the subscription agreement even if you subsequently learn information about the company that you consider to be materially unfavorable  the company reserves the right to begin using the proceeds from this offering as soon as the funds have been received and will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering  the precise amounts and timing of the company’s use of the net proceeds will depend upon market conditions and the availability of other funds among other factors there can be no assurance that the company will receive sufficient funds to execute the company’s business strategy and accomplish the company’s objectives  additionally you may be unable to sell your shares of our common stock at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price you paid for such shares and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock   risks associated with our common stock   we arbitrarily determined the price of the shares of our common stock to be sold pursuant to this prospectus and such price does not reflect the actual market price for the securities consequently there is an increased risk that you may not be able to resell our common stock at the price you bought it for   we determined the initial offering price of  per share of the common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus arbitrarily the price is not based on our financial condition or prospects on the market prices of securities of comparable publicly traded companies on financial and operating information of companies engaged in similar activities to ours or on general conditions of the securities market the price may not be indicative of the market price if any for our common stock in the trading market after this offering  if the market price for our stock drops below the price which you paid you may not be able to resell our common stock at the price you bought it for   our common stock may never be quoted on the otc bulletin board to be quoted on the otcbb a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock as of the date of this registration statement we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application and there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf and that even if an application is filed there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation our stock may become quoted rather than traded on the otcbb whenif our shares of common stock commence trading on the otc bulletin board the trading price will fluctuate significantly and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares   as of the date of this registration statement our common stock does not yet trade on the overthecounter bulletin board our common stock may never be quoted on the otc bulletin board  whenif our shares of common stock begin trading on the bulletin board there is a inconstancy associated with bulletin board securities in general and the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock i disappointing results from our development efforts ii failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget iii decline in demand for our common stock iv downward revisions in securities analysts’ estimates or changes in general market conditions v technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies vi lack of funding generated for operations vii investor perception of our industry or our prospects and viii general economic trends   further more stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile these fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as a result investors may be unable to sell their shares at a fair price and you may lose all or part of your investment   our shares of common stock are subject to the “penny stock” rules of the securities and exchange commission and the trading market in our securities will be limited which will make transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock          the sec has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise discharged from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock market a brokerdealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and sales person in the transaction and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for stock that becomes subject to those penny stock rules if a trading market for our common stock develops our common stock will probably become subject to the penny stock rules and shareholders may have difficulties in selling their shares   there is no current trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop purchasers of our securities may have difficulties selling their shares   there is currently no established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or if developed may not be sustained we intend to have a market maker apply for admission to quotation of our securities on the overthecounter bulletin board after the sec declares the registration statement relating to this prospectus effective we do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application if for any reason our common stock is not quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board or a public trading market does not otherwise develop purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so no market makers have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so   we may in the future issue additional shares of common stock which will dilute share value of investors in the offering   our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share of which  shares are issued and outstanding the future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by investors in the offering and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   we intend to become subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended which will require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports these additional costs will negatively affect our ability to earn a profit following the effective date of the registration statement in which this prospectus is included we will be required to file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to the securities exchange act of  and the rules and regulations thereunder in order to comply with such requirements our independent registered auditors will have to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis moreover our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports although we believe that the approximately  we have estimated for these costs should be sufficient for the  month period following the completion of our offering the costs charged by these professionals for such services may vary significantly factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot accurately be determined at this time and may have a major negative affect on the cost and amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys however the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit however for as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that you become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period        after and if ever we are no longer an “emerging growth company” we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including section  of the sarbanesoxley act we are not a “shell company” within the meaning of rule  promulgated pursuant to securities act because we do have hard assets and real business operations   we are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   under the jumpstart our business startups act “emerging growth companies” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies”   we are not a “shell company” within the meaning of rule  promulgated pursuant to securities act because we do have hard assets and real business operations   market for our common stock   market information   there is no established public market for our common stock   after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part we intend to try to identify a market maker to file an application with the financial industry regulatory authority inc or finra to have our common stock quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board we will have to satisfy certain criteria in order for our application to be accepted we do not currently have a market maker that is willing to participate in this application process and even if we identify a market maker there can be no assurance as to whether we will meet the requisite criteria or that our application will be accepted our common stock may never be quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board or even if quoted a liquid or viable market may not materialize there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our shares will develop or if developed that it will be sustained   we have issued  shares of our common stock since our inception on february   there are no outstanding options or warrants or securities that are convertible into shares of common stock   holders                                                    we have  holder of record of our common stock as of the date of this prospectus          securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation

number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of    and  respectively of the

receipts will be deposited into our corporate financial balance if we rise less than  of the offering proceeds the only expected source of funds to commence planned business activities is a loan from our director suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe our sole officer and director has agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process and to maintain a reporting status with the sec no proceeds from this offering will be used to repay mr sudusinghe for any funds advanced for the purpose of completing the registration process we will require a minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a minimum period of one year including costs associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the sec                                                                             determination of offering price   we have determined the offering price of the shares arbitrarily the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities          among the factors considered were ·          our lack of operating history ·          the proceeds to be raised by the offering ·          the amount of capital to be contributed by purchasers in this offering in proportion to the amount of stock to be retained by our existing stockholders and ·          our relative cash requirements                                                                                                         dilution   the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share this price is significantly higher than the price paid by the company’s sole officer and director suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe  for common equity since the company’s inception on february   mr sudusinghe paid  per share for the  shares of common stock he purchased from the company   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders the following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders   as of may   the net tangible book value was  or  and the net tangible book value per share was  based upon  shares outstanding   if  of shares are sold upon completion of this offering in the event all of the shares are sold the net tangible book value of the  shares to be outstanding will be  or approximately  per share the net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is  the net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by  per share without any additional investment on their part investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from  per share to  per share after completion of this offering if  shares are sold investors in the offering will own  of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of  or  per share our existing stockholders will own  of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they have made contributions of cash totaling  or  per share   if  of shares are sold   upon completion of this offering in the event  shares are sold the

stock market a brokerdealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and sales person in the transaction and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise

transportation and vat incl from a chinese company b industrial machines ltd   we are planning to purchase our main raw material elephant dung from indian elephant orphanage situated in pinnawala sri lanka elephants which live there will provide us with main necessary raw materials we are planning to buy raw materials in price  per tonne we think this volume of raw materials will be enough for the first several months when we will fix up our production the process of the paper production is simple all paper is made from a pulp mixture derived from fiber materials the most common papers today come from wood fiber pulp from cut trees in accordance to this fact we choose elephant dung firstly elephant dung fiber is collected from the indian elephant orphanage cleaning and boiling are important stages in the dung papermaking process all nonfiber materials are removed as much as possible at this point so that all that remains are actual fiber materials the fibers are then “ boiled to a pulp ” for  hours the boiling process occurs at  degrees celsius in order to ensure that the protein based cells of any bacteria are destroyed by extreme heating our cleaning and boiling processes use no chemicals or other cleansing agents we use only water the boiled pulp is then put through pulp beaters colors or dyes are added when the pulp is beaten in the beater then the pulp is mixed with water and lifted up on flat sieves then paper must dry so it is poured into special molds to dry into reams of paper after a couple of days the product is almost ready once the paper has been dried it is either smoothened by stones to make it smooth and usable in the end of our process we receive dung paper if we will sell  of shares from this offering we plan to focus our efforts on the production of the paper in this case we do not plan to spend monies for the development of our website to set up our office or to hire additional workers to help our sole officer and director

administration understandings toward the end of the twelvemonth time frame there is no assurance that we will have the capacity to draw in and all the more essentially hold enough clients to legitimize our consumptions on the off chance that we can not create a lot of income and to effectively secure ourselves against those dangers then it would substantially influence our monetary condition and our business could be adversely influenced as well   hire workers time frame  th  th months   if we sell  of shares in this offering we do not plan to hire any workers suneetha sudusinghe our directore and sole officer will operate the production by himself if we sell at least  of the shares in this offering we intend to hire four assistants if we sell at least  of the

allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required covering the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting company   management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in startup companies pose the most significant challenge to the company’s success over the next year and in future years additionally the company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company the company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements especially that of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  this additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations description of business organization within the last five years we were incorporated in the state of

shri lanka we have generated no revenues since inception and our principal business activities to date also consist of creating a business plan purchasing a domainname for our prospective webpage        we are not a “shell company” within the meaning of rule  promulgated pursuant to securities act because we do have hard assets and real business operations we need proceeds from this offering to start our month plan of operation the total estimated minimum amount of funds required to develop our business is approximately   we need funds for offering costs general administrative expenses production equipment purchase business development marketing costs support materials and costs associated with being a publicly reporting company we have generated limited revenues from operations to

however in future we can make some items for various traveler shops and kiosks corporate customers and individual customers will be covered by our web page and targeted marketing exercises product overview geant corp’s business is in making unique products to be sold to both massmarket customers and individual clients in future we want to focus on something that is socially and environmentally responsible so we are contributing to the solution and not adding to the problem we want to work with something that had more meaning to us something we could be passionate about and that possibly could have an important social statement attached to it all of our paper products are  recycled they do not have any smell they are made up of  fiber from elephant dung and  post consumer paper all papers everywhere are made from a pulp mixture derived from fiber materials the most common papers today come from wood fiber pulp from cut trees our fibers of choice of course are dung fibers we use the dung fibers from elephants to make our dung paper products   all elephants that generate the dung that we require for our process have at least two things in common         all are herbivores and have highly fibrous diets of different plants and vegetation         all possess inefficient digestive systems that do not completely digest and breakdown all the fibers that they eat this results in a significant amount of fibers remaining intact when these animals dung there are no toxic chemicals used in our paper making process natural vegetative binding agents along with watersoluble salt dyes for coloring are used our dung papers are handmade acid free and as organic as it gets   we are focused on the production of dung paper for massmarket customers to give them the ability of making different stationery products souvenirs touristoriented products upmarket gifts and interior design items from natural products on advanced and unique designs it would be easier for them to buy raw materials paper from us to produce needed products instead of making paper it is easier for us at the beginning to set up the production of paper instead of setting up the whole paper production and of different kinds of stationery products at the same time in the future we have plans about production of some additional stationery items aside from paper geant corp has the ability to product handmade dung paper for making such original items as for example ·          bags ·          frames ·          photo albums ·          notebooks ·          stationery ·          cards   however first we intend to launch a mass production of inexpensive handmade dung paper for making different stationery products and various tourist souvenirs which were made using elephant dung hollander beater for

    potential customers our president and director suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe will showcase our item and arrange with potential clients and wholesale purchasers we expect to create and keep up a database of potential corporate customers who might be keen on our items we will catch up with these customers intermittently and offer them free examples presentations and uncommon rebates now and again three fundamental classifications of our customers are ·          wholesale exchange speaking to expansive organizations which are assembling diverse stationery items it is preference for them to purchase fit dung paper instead of making it themselves further more they have an opportunity to concentrate on the manufacturing process of stationery items ·          corporate customers speaking to extensive medium and little scale organizations different affiliations and so on this is a somewhat generous fragment of the business sector which develops and routinely creates interest for different corporate blessings gifts things that advance brand mindfulness and so on competition we know that there are a number of obstacles to entering the market of dung paper items and the competition is rather high  there are several companies poopoopaper haathi chaap and ecomaximus that offer comparative items and we will have to compete with them we see the main competitive advantage of our competitors in the established customer base and marketing outlets howbeit we arranged on a wholesale exchange for the most part so we will have capacity to offer our item for extensive organizations in huge amount so our item is more extensive and quality is better ways to deal with business are more flexible  one of our biggest competitive advantages is that our item is raw material for different companies so we would have a major measure of delivering item at the brief timeframe some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows   number of competitors increase different companies may follow our business model of distributing high quality paper items made from elephant dung which will reduce our competitive edge   price our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell our product at loss  substitute products ompetitors may substitute items made from elephant dung with comparable items made from dung of some other animals        marketing our sole officer and chief suneetha nandana silva sudusinghe will be in charge of promoting of our company and our high quality dung paper we intend to use such marketing strategies as web advertisements direct mailing and phone calls to acquire potential customers we intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics such as registering with top search engines using selected key words and metatags and utilizing link and banner exchange options we will utilize numerous internet showcasing instruments to direct activity to our site and distinguish potential clients as of the date of this prospectus we have already purchased a website wwwgeantcorpcom and plan to develop it we

production procedure and incorporates some broad data and pictures of high quality dung paper we plan to utilize internet advancement apparatuses on facebook and twitter to publicize our company and make connections to our site we will intend to continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations we intend to spend from  to  on marketing efforts during the first year d epending on the amount of investments raised as a result of this offering there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures if we are

other pertinent conditions it is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but rather to reinvest earnings if any in our business operations nevada antitakeover laws currently we have no nevada shareholders and since this offering will not be made in the state of nevada no shares will be sold to its residents further we do not do business in nevada directly or through an affiliate corporation and we do not intend to do so accordingly there are no antitakeover provisions that have the affect of delaying or preventing a change in our control the nevada business corporation law contains a provision governing “acquisition of controlling interest” this law provides generally that any person or entity that acquires  or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publiclyheld nevada corporation in the secondary public or private market may be denied voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested stockholders of the corporation elects to restore such voting rights in whole or in part  the control share acquisition law provides that a person or entity acquires “control shares” whenever it acquires shares that but for the operation of the control share acquisition act would bring its voting power within any of the following three ranges   to      to  or  more than  a “control share acquisition” is generally defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of either ownership or voting power associated with issued and outstanding control shares  the stockholders or board of directors of a corporation may elect to exempt the stock of the corporation from the provisions of the control share acquisition act through adoption of a provision to that effect in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation  our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not exempt our common stock from the control share acquisition law  the control share acquisition law is applicable only to shares of “issuing corporations” as defined by the act  an issuing corporation is a nevada corporation which  has  or more stockholders with at least  of such stockholders being both stockholders of record and residents of nevada and  does business in nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation at this time we do not have  stockholders of record resident of nevada therefore the provisions of the control share acquisition law do not apply to acquisitions of our shares and will not until such time as these requirements have been met at such time as they may apply to us the provisions of the control share acquisition law may discourage companies or persons interested in acquiring a significant interest in or control of the company regardless of whether such acquisition may be in the interest of our stockholders        the nevada “combination with interested stockholders’ statute” may also have an effect of delaying or making it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company this statute prevents an “interested stockholder” and a resident domestic nevada corporation from entering into a “combination” unless certain conditions are met  the statute defines “combination” to include a ny merger or consolidation with an “interested stockholder” or any sale lease exchange mortgage pledge transfer or other disposition in one transaction or a series of transactions with an “interested stockholder” having  an aggregate market value equal to  percent or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation  an aggregate market value equal to  percent or more of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation or  representing  percent or more of the earning power or net income of the corporation an “interested stockholder” means the beneficial owner of  percent or more of the voting shares of a resident domestic corporation or an affiliate or associate thereof  a corporation affected by the statute may not engage in a “combination” within three years after the interested stockholder acquires its shares unless the combination or purchase is approved by the board of directors before the interested stockholder acquired such shares  if approval is not obtained then after the expiration of the threeyear period the business combination may be consummated with the approval of the board of directors or a majority of the voting power held by disinterested stockholders or if the consideration to be paid by the interested stockholder is at least equal to the highest of  the highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the three years immediately preceding the date of the announcement of the combination or in the transaction in which he became an interested stockholder whichever is higher  the market value per common share on the date of announcement of the combination or the date the interested stockholder acquired the shares whichever is higher or  if higher for the holders of preferred stock the highest liquidation value of the preferred stock the effect of nevada’s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors reports we will be required to file reports with the sec under section d of the securities act the reports will be filed electronically the reports we will be required to file are forms k q and k you may read copies of any materials we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room at  f
