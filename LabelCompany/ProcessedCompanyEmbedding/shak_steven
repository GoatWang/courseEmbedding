steven shak md cofounder chief scientific officer steven shak md cofounder chief scientific officer we urgently need new and more effective approaches to cancer diagnosis treatment and preventionin the th century with few diagnostic tests to select the right treatment for individual cancers physicians treated cancer with a “onesizefitsall” approachat genomic health we have developed innovative
