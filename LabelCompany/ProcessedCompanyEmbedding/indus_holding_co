cachapero  march   already servicing more than  dispensaries with eight brands indus is looking forward to a massive escalation in consumer interest when adult use hits california in  california open your golden gate cannabis products distributor indus holding company can’t wait for legalization in cali to be sorted out over  according to indus founder and chief executive officer robert weakley consumer demand which had been growing steadily throughout  took off in november “since the election you can feel the excitement for the adultuse market to start in california” weakley said “business is great “we’ve seen a huge increase in consumers asking where they can buy our products” he continued “now that it’s ‘legal’ we have to explain to them they have to wait until january ’ also our dispensary partners are saying they have people showing up every day calling to purchase product and excited about trying legal cannabis we still have a long way to go here as we work toward ” by dispensary partners weakley is referring to the someodd california dispensaries on indus’s client list and to which they represent eight brands dixie brands altai brands cannapro juju joints flavor therabis moon and w vapes “currently our moon bars and w vapes are the two brands that lead sales” he commented “w vapes is an amazing vape pen” he continued “they’ve got a great product and an amazing team behind it they spend a lot of time supporting the brand through marketing efforts as well as educating patients and budtenders on proper use quality and consistency—moon is kind of the leader when it comes to highdose chocolate edibles right now it’s a quality product offered at a low price for the medicinal user—today’s user” as the legal market opens for recreational use one trend weakley said is getting hotter is “microdosing”—cannabis products in mg to mg dosages to give new consumers a thclight option “‘microdosing’ is a hot term these days” he explained “it’s taking a small dose to be social for individuals that don’t indulge in the product on a daily basis per se the new customers coming in with recreational they haven’t had the strength so it’s just like anything else if you’ve never had alcohol before and you have one drink you feel may feel completely buzzed as we all know you can never die from an ‘overdose’ of cannabis but you can definitely have a bad experience you never want someone to have a bad experience with your products” the new consumer also is label and ingredientsavvy so accuracy in labeling and using premium quality ingredients are allimportant customers are looking for labproven thc percentages words like “vegan” and “organic” and a brand’s commitment to ecofriendly practices “products with more natural ingredients—these days that’s kind of a trend” weakley said “people want to see what’s in their product so having clear labeling and testing is vital we’re very particular on our testing when we tell you it’s mg or mg that’s of active thc we always want to make sure it’s about consistency we want to make sure every time you try one of our products you have the same experience” rising consumer interest may be matched by the profusion of product manufacturers popping up with every imaginable application and concoction you never would’ve dreamt of before legalization when adding to their line up indus’ strategy is pretty simple “we’re always looking for products that have the potential to be bestinmarket in its category” weakley said “doesn’t necessarily mean the most expensive but more the best product for the best price giving the patient a quality product for the best price is usually a winning combo” manufacturers looking for representation in california are eager to establish themselves for the green rush of  weakley encourages any prospective vendors to have a solid game plan becoming a recognized brand in a big competitive market takes longterm commitment and resources on top of funding and not a small amount of oldfashioned hard work “it’s important for a new team to understand the resources needed to start a brand here in california everyone’s excited to present a product to the largest cannabis market in the world but they usually underestimate the financial and human capital needed for launching a brand here into the void” weakley explained “we always ask a brand that’s interested in or coming under our umbrella to contact us” he added “they need to be prepared with product samples management team bios and a marketing plan including research as to where their product fits in we really evaluate the teams behind each brand it’s important who we’re doing business with so the team is very important when it comes to brand building” especially for a new product vendor being represented by a licensed distributor in a large region like california can be key to getting on shelves and spreading brand awareness to dispensaries and eventually retail vendors indus aims to assist with operational issues including local regulations “it’s our goal to kind of collaborate with the manufacturer to get the stress of operations off their minds so they can concentrate on their brand and brand building” weakley said so how does he see  shaking out in regard to the massive effort required to make the california market a shining example of industry to supporters and opponents alike “where do we start” weakley asked laughing “ is going to be a very interesting and challenging year there’s so much to do here still with setting up the regulatory market “you know california is not like any other state” he continued “we’ve had a cannabis industry here for decades so it’s not just starting out something new we have to figure out how to transition it and what that transition will look like with both local and state agencies working through what that transition looks like some areas and cities have set up different ordinances so how do we align it the state regulations require a company to operate in compliance with local laws before they can even apply for a state license “you’ve got approximately  to  dispensaries in california right now who gets licenses who doesn’t how do you transition to the license” he asked touching only the tip of the hulking regulatory iceberg “there are a lot of things still to be worked out you’ve got mmrsa and auma which are both medicinal and recreational” he added “there’s overlap but there’s also a lot of differences between the two bills how do they combine those two so we can have a consistent regulatory system here” indus has worked closely with local state county and city governments to remain compliant with any requests and regulations even as local officials also are trying to understand new standards and formulate policy committed to raising community awareness about adult use of cannabis indus and weakley also believe contributing back to local communities eventually will lead to public acceptance california always has been a boomorbust state it’s the last frontier for outlaws easterners immigrants getrichquick types and lately billionaire barons of tech what does weakley think will happen once the feds come out west with their newly confirmed attorney general jeff sessions “it is kind of that waitandsee thing where we are right now” he said “it’s something we all need to watch closely but it’s also somewhat out of our control those in the industry just need to focus on their business and work with the state to hopefully show the industry shines it can be a very legitimate industry with a positive impact” trends currently of interest at indus holding company according to founder and ceo robert weakley “microdosing” products with active thc at less than mg often mg to mg doses for new recreational users starting with a low dose creates a pleasant social buzz accurate and professional labeling today’s consumers are labelconscious in terms of thc percentage ingredients and branding already a sales leader the market for vape pens and cartridges is poised for steadily increasing sales as consumer interest in vaping continues to grow indusholdingcocom sign up for the
