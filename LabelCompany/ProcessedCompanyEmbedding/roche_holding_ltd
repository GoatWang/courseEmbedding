object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime

powerful as all these other big pharmas healthcare has been getting kicked around in recent months as we’ve transitioned to the donald trump presidency first investors were bullish that a republicandominated white house and congress would mean less regulation and a friendlier more probusiness environment then trump tweeted that he thought drug prices were too high then congress had the hot potato of the affordable care act aka obamacare to repeal and replace which added even more uncertainty into the mix one thing that is certain is the big players will have a seat at the table regardless of what transpires and that is a distinct advantage what does this mean for rhhby stock what may not be so apparent is that rhhby is the biggest big pharma by market cap aside from johnson  johnson nysejnj which is so diversified that it’s a bit more than just a big pharma roche has many of the top selling drugs in the market today — neupogen anaprox avastin to name a few — and has a very strong pipeline it is also becoming very competitive in the immunooncology space with its drugs perjeta and now alecensa these drugs target nonsmallcell lung cancer which is becoming a very crowded space for this new class of drugs that’s the case because this specific cancer is not responsive to most therapies and is usually inoperable this allows drugmakers to see how their drugs work on humans that have no real recourse to other therapies for patients there has been little hope other than newer versions of chemotherapy and radiation the good news is these nextgeneration drugs are getting better and better now they’re getting months more to live without the debilitating effects of chemotherapy nvs was first to market with its drug xalkori it has now released a new version dubbed zykadia but rhhby is now making a splash with alecensa it seems to be better tolerated and it was just awarded its second ‘breakthrough’ designation from the us food and drug administration also within the past week roche has announced that it is working with germanybased biontech in venture worth  million to research and develop mrna based individualized cancer vaccines the point is rhhby has not stopped its efforts to stay on the cutting edge build a vital product pipeline and continue to provide great products it’s also pretty shareholder friendly as well currently roche is delivering a rocksolid  dividend which helps smooth out the choppy waters that most healthcare stocks are now in richard band’s profitable investing advisory service helps retirement savers outperform
