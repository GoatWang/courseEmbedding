generalize the real numbers complex numbers quaternions and several other hypercomplex number systems the theory of clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal transformations clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including geometry theoretical physics and digital image processing they are named after the english

computational tool for physicists john snygg clifford algebra a computational tool for physicists john snygg description clifford algebras have become an indispensable tool for physicists at the cutting edge of theoretical investigations applications in physics range from special relativity and the rotating top at one end of the spectrum to general relativity and diracs equation for the electron at the other clifford algebras have also become a virtual necessity in some areas of physics and their usefulness is expanding in other areas such as algebraic manipulations involving dirac matrices in quantum thermodynamics kaluzaklein theories and dimensional renormalization theories and the formation of superstring theories this book aimed at beginning graduate students in physics and

computational tool for physicists john snygg reviews and awards a wonderful booki have browsed through it while occupied with several other competing projects in the process i have internalized the classification of clifford algebras learned how physicists use diracs equation what they are doing when they talk about gauge theory understood hodge duality much better and so the codifferential operator and i still have only browsed through a small portion of the text i think we mathematicians should study the book to learn how to improve our own levels of exposition daniel h gottlieb
