strategies private equity firms may use are as follows leveraged buyout being the most important leveraged buyout main article leveraged buyout diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction leveraged buyout lbo or buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company business unit or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage the companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate operating cash flows private equity firms view target companies as either platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a standalone entity or as addon or tuckin acquisitions which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits leveraged buyouts involve a financial sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition to do this the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments acquisition debt in an lbo is often nonrecourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor therefore an lbo transactions financial structure is particularly attractive to a funds limited partners allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage this kind of financing structure leverage benefits an lbos financial sponsor in two ways  the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition and  the returns to the investor will be enhanced as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt as a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target market conditions the willingness of lenders to extend credit both to the lbos financial sponsors and the company to be acquired as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to cover those costs historically the debt portion of a lbo will range from – of the purchase price although during certain periods the debt ratio can be higher or lower than the historical averages between – debt averaged between  and  of total purchase price for lbos in the united states simple example of leveraged buyout a private equity fund say for example abc capital ii borrows bn from a bank or other lender to this it adds bn of equity – money from its own partners and from limited partners pension funds rich individuals etc with this bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company xyz industrial after due diligence ie checking the books it replaces the senior management in xyz industrial and they set out to streamline it the workforce is reduced some assets are sold off etc the objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale the stock market is experiencing a bull market and xyz industrial is sold two years after the buyout for bn yielding a profit of bn the original loan can now be paid off with interest of say bn the remaining profit of bn is shared among the partners taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates note that part of that profit results from turning the company around and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market the latter often being the greater component notes the lenders the people who put up the bn in the example can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk or by buying credit default swaps cdss or selling collateralised debt obligations cdos fromto other institutions although this is no business of the private equity firm often the loanequity bn above is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company xyz industrial for it to pay off over time this can be advantageous since the interest is typically offsettable against the profits of the company thus reducing or even eliminating tax most buyout deals are much smaller the global average purchase in  was m for example the target company xyz industrials here does not have to be floated on the stockmarket indeed most buyout exits are not iposcitation needed buyout operations can go wrong and in such cases the loss is increased by leverage just as the profit is if all goes wellcitation needed growth capital main article growth capital growth capital refers to equity investments most often minority investments in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle these companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions acquisitions or other investments because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion sales and marketing initiatives equipment purchases and new product development the primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone by selling part of the company to private equity the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a companys balance sheet particularly to reduce the amount of leverage or debt the company has on its balance sheet a private investment in public equity or pipes refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company pipe investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time the registered direct or rd is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital a registered direct is similar to a pipe but is instead sold as a registered security mezzanine capital main article mezzanine capital mezzanine capital refers to subordinated debt or preferred equity securities that often represent the most junior portion of a companys capital structure that is senior to the companys common equity this form of financing is often used by private equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion mezzanine capital which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon venture capital main article venture capital venture capital is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made typically in less mature companies for the launch of a seed or startup company early stage development or expansion of a business venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams venture capital is often subdivided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early stage capital used for the launch of startup companies to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth entrepreneurs often develop products and ideas that require substantial capital during the formative stages of their companies life cycles many entrepreneurs do not have sufficient funds to finance projects themselves and they must therefore seek outside financing the venture capitalists need to deliver high returns to compensate for the risk of these investments makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies being able to secure financing is critical to any business whether it is a startup seeking venture capital or a midsized firm that needs more cash to grow venture capital is most suitable for businesses with large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt although venture capital is often most closely associated with fastgrowing technology healthcare and biotechnology fields venture funding has been used for other more traditional businesses investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversiﬁed private equity portfolio but also to pursue the larger returns the strategy has the potential to offer however venture capital funds have produced lower returns for investors over recent years compared to other private equity fund types particularly buyout distressed and special situations main article distressed securities distressed or special situations is a broad category referring to investments in equity or debt securities of financially stressed companies the distressed category encompasses two broad substrategies including distressedtocontrol or loantoown strategies where the investor acquires debt securities in the hopes of emerging from a corporate restructuring in control of the companys equity special situations or turnaround strategies where an investor will provide debt and equity investments often rescue financing to companies undergoing operational or financial challenges in addition to these private equity strategies hedge funds employ a variety of distressed investment strategies including the active trading of loans and bonds issued by distressed companies secondaries main article private equity secondary market secondary investments refer to investments made in existing private equity assets these transactions can involve the sale of private equity fund interests or portfolios of direct investments in privately held companies through the purchase of these investments from existing institutional investors by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buy and hold investors secondary investments provide institutional investors with the ability to improve vintage diversification particularly for investors that are new to the asset class secondaries also typically experience a different cash flow profile diminishing the jcurve effect of investing in new private equity funds often investments in secondaries are made through third party fund vehicle structured similar to a fund of funds although many large institutional investors have purchased private equity fund interests through secondary transactions sellers of private equity fund investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds other strategies other strategies that can be considered private equity or a close adjacent market include real estate in the context of private equity this will typically refer to the riskier end of the investment spectrum including value added and opportunity funds where the investments often more closely resemble leveraged buyouts than traditional real estate investments certain investors in private equity consider real estate to be a separate asset class infrastructure investments in various public works eg bridges tunnels toll roads airports public transportation and other public works that are made typically as part of a privatization initiative on the part of a government entity energy and power investments in a wide variety of companies rather than assets engaged in the production and sale of energy including fuel extraction manufacturing refining and distribution

the deal closed  million of waterman cash and assets were used to retire  million of the loan debt similar to the approach employed in the mclean transaction the use of publicly traded holding companies as investment vehicles to acquire portfolios of investments in corporate assets was a relatively new trend in the s popularized by the likes of warren buffett berkshire hathaway and victor posner dwg corporation and later adopted by nelson peltz triarc saul steinberg reliance insurance and gerry schwartz onex corporation these investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms in fact it is posner who is often credited with coining the term leveraged buyout or lbo the leveraged buyout boom of the s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers most notably jerome kohlberg jr and later his protégé henry kravis working for bear stearns at the time kohlberg and kravis along with kravis cousin george roberts began a series of what they described as bootstrap investments many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren clay  as well as thompson wire eagle motors and barrows through their investment in stern metals by  tensions had built up between bear stearns and kohlberg kravis and roberts leading to their departure and the formation of kohlberg kravis roberts in that year private equity in

gibson greetings a producer of greeting cards for  million of which only  million was rumored to have been contributed by the investors by mid just sixteen months after the original deal gibson completed a  million ipo and simon made approximately  million the success of the gibson greetings investment attracted the attention of the wider media to the nascent boom in leveraged buyouts between  and  it was estimated that there were over  leveraged buyouts valued in excess of  million during the s constituencies within acquired companies and the media ascribed the corporate raid label to many private equity investments particularly those that featured a hostile takeover of the company perceived asset stripping major layoffs or other significant corporate restructuring activities among the most notable investors to be labeled corporate raiders in the s included carl icahn victor posner nelson peltz robert m bass t boone pickens harold clark simmons kirk kerkorian

clients of michael milken whose investment banking firm drexel burnham lambert helped raise blind pools of capital with which corporate raiders could make a legitimate attempt to take over a company and provided highyield debt junk bonds financing of the buyouts one of the final major buyouts of the s proved to be its most ambitious and marked both a highwater mark and a sign of the beginning of the end of the boom that had begun nearly a decade earlier in  kkr kohlberg kravis roberts closed in on a  billion takeover of rjr nabisco it was at that time and for over  years the largest leverage buyout in history the event was chronicled in the book and later the movie barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco kkr would eventually prevail in acquiring rjr nabisco at  per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that shearson lehman hutton would take rjr nabisco private at  per share a fierce series of negotiations and horsetrading ensued which pitted kkr against shearson and later forstmann little  co many of the major banking players of the day including morgan stanley goldman sachs salomon brothers and merrill lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties after shearsons original bid kkr quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain rjr nabisco for  per share—a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of rjr nabiscos management rjrs management team working with shearson and salomon brothers submitted a bid of  a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by kraviss team kkrs final bid of  while a lower dollar figure was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of rjr nabisco at  billion of transaction value rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyouts in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed that for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco by the end of the s the excesses of the buyout market were beginning to show with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts including robert campeaus  buyout of federated department stores the  buyout of the revco drug stores walter industries feb trucking and eaton leonard additionally the rjr nabisco deal was showing signs of strain leading to a recapitalization in  that involved the contribution of  billion of new equity from kkr in the end kkr lost  million on rjr drexel reached an agreement with the

available to finance large leveraged buyouts july and august saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with few issuers accessing the market uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn however the expected rebound in the market after  may  did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing by the end of september the full extent of the

and the private equity firms with hundreds of billions of dollars of committed capital from investors are looking to deploy capital in new and different transactionscitation needed as a result of the global financial crisis private equity has become subject to increased regulation in europe and is now subject among other things to rules preventing asset stripping of portfolio companies and requiring the notification and disclosure of information in connection with buyout activity investments in private equity diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund although the capital for private equity originally came from individual investors or corporations in the s private equity became an asset class in which various institutional investors allocated capital in the hopes of achieving risk adjusted returns that exceed those possible in the public equity markets in the s insurers were major private equity investors later public pension funds and university and other endowments became more significant sources of capital for most institutional investors private equity investments are made as part of a broad asset allocation that includes traditional assets eg public equity and bonds and other alternative assets eg hedge funds real estate commodities investor categories us canadian and european public and private pension schemes have invested in the asset class since the early s to diversify away from their core holdings public equity and fixed income today pension investment in private equity accounts for more than a third of all monies allocated to the asset class ahead of other institutional investors such as insurance companies endowments and sovereign wealth funds direct vs indirect investment most institutional investors do not invest directly in privately held companies lacking the expertise and resources necessary to structure and monitor the investment instead institutional investors will invest indirectly through a private equity fund certain institutional investors have the scale necessary to develop a diversified portfolio of private equity funds themselves while others will invest through a fund of funds to allow a portfolio more diversified than one a single investor could construct investment timescales returns on private equity investments are created through one or a combination of three factors that include debt repayment or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid a key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time which will vary depending on the investment strategy private equity investments are typically realized through one of the following avenues an initial public offering ipo – shares of the company are offered to the public typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares a merger or acquisition – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company a recapitalization – cash is distributed to the shareholders in this case the financial sponsor and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution large institutional asset owners such as pension funds with typically longdated liabilities insurance companies sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of private equity investment the median horizon for a lbo transaction is  years liquidity in the private equity market diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest the buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund main article private equity secondary market the private equity secondary market also often called private equity secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets increasingly secondaries are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private equity investments as a result investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private equity programs driven by strong demand for private equity exposure a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lockup periods lack of transparency unlimited leverage concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of limited partnership interests – the most common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund sale of direct interests – secondary directs or synthetic secondaries this category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from

equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm becoming a limited partner in the fund rather than an investor in the firm itself as a result an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund in which it has invested fund of funds these are private equity funds that invest in other private equity funds in order to provide investors with a lower risk product through exposure to a large number of vehicles often of different type and regional focus fund of funds accounted for  of global commitments made to private equity funds in  individuals with substantial net worth substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law since private equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds for example in the us most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors which requires  million of net worth  of individual income or  of joint income with spouse for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue as fundraising has grown over the past few years so too has the number of investors in the average fund in  there were  investors in the average private equity fund this figure has now grown to  according to preqin ltd formerly known as private equity intelligence the managers of private equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles typically providing between – of the overall capital often private equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles the use of placement agents has grown over the past few years with  of funds closed in  employing their services according to preqin ltd placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager and will typically take a fee of around  of the commitments that they are able to garner the amount of time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer with managers of less popular fund types such as us and european venture fund managers in the current climate finding the fundraising process more tough it is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months once a fund has reached its fundraising target it will have a final close after this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on

funds increasingly sovereign wealth funds are growing as an investor class for private equity private equity fund performance due to limited disclosure studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult unlike mutual funds private equity funds need not disclose performance data and as they invest in private companies it is difficult to examine the underlying investments it is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized an oftcited academic paper kaplan and shoar  suggests that the netoffees returns to pe funds are roughly comparable to the sp  or even slightly under this analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias ie funds that fail wont report data one should also note that these returns are not riskadjusted a more recent paper harris jenkinson and kaplan  found that average buyout fund returns in the us have actually exceeded that of public markets these findings were supported by earlier work using a different data set robinson and sensoy  commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment it is also claimed that pe fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry two other findings in kaplan and schoar  first there is considerable variation in performance across pe funds second unlike the mutual fund industry there appears to be performance persistence in pe funds that is pe funds that perform well over one period tend to also perform well the next period persistence is stronger for vc firms than for lbo firms the application of the freedom of information act foia in certain states in the united states has made certain performance data more readily available specifically foia has required certain public agencies to disclose private equity performance data directly on their websites in the united kingdom the second largest market for private equity more data has become available since the  publication of the david walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency in private equity debate recording private equity there is a debate around the distinction between private equity and foreign direct investment fdi and whether to treat them separately the difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter or investorheld shares also known as freefloating shares the main point of contention is that fdi is used solely for production whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets at present most countries report private equity as a part of fdi cognitive bias private equity decisionmaking has been shown to suffer from cognitive biases such as illusion of control and overconfidence see also history of private equity and venture capital private investment in public equity publicly traded private equity specialized investment fund organizations private

strategies private equity firms may use are as follows leveraged buyout being the most important leveraged buyout main article leveraged buyout diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction leveraged buyout lbo or buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company business unit or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage the companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate operating cash flows private equity firms view target companies as either platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a standalone entity or as addon or tuckin acquisitions which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits leveraged buyouts involve a financial sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition to do this the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments acquisition debt in an lbo is often nonrecourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor therefore an lbo transactions financial structure is particularly attractive to a funds limited partners allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage this kind of financing structure leverage benefits an lbos financial sponsor in two ways  the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition and  the returns to the investor will be enhanced as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt as a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target market conditions the willingness of lenders to extend credit both to the lbos financial sponsors and the company to be acquired as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to cover those costs historically the debt portion of a lbo will range from – of the purchase price although during certain periods the debt ratio can be higher or lower than the historical averages between – debt averaged between  and  of total purchase price for lbos in the united states simple example of leveraged buyout a private equity fund say for example abc capital ii borrows bn from a bank or other lender to this it adds bn of equity – money from its own partners and from limited partners pension funds rich individuals etc with this bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company xyz industrial after due diligence ie checking the books it replaces the senior management in xyz industrial and they set out to streamline it the workforce is reduced some assets are sold off etc the objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale the stock market is experiencing a bull market and xyz industrial is sold two years after the buyout for bn yielding a profit of bn the original loan can now be paid off with interest of say bn the remaining profit of bn is shared among the partners taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates note that part of that profit results from turning the company around and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market the latter often being the greater component notes the lenders the people who put up the bn in the example can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk or by buying credit default swaps cdss or selling collateralised debt obligations cdos fromto other institutions although this is no business of the private equity firm often the loanequity bn above is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company xyz industrial for it to pay off over time this can be advantageous since the interest is typically offsettable against the profits of the company thus reducing or even eliminating tax most buyout deals are much smaller the global average purchase in  was m for example the target company xyz industrials here does not have to be floated on the stockmarket indeed most buyout exits are not iposcitation needed buyout operations can go wrong and in such cases the loss is increased by leverage just as the profit is if all goes wellcitation needed growth capital main article growth capital growth capital refers to equity investments most often minority investments in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle these companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions acquisitions or other investments because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion sales and marketing initiatives equipment purchases and new product development the primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone by selling part of the company to private equity the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a companys balance sheet particularly to reduce the amount of leverage or debt the company has on its balance sheet a private investment in public equity or pipes refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company pipe investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time the registered direct or rd is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital a registered direct is similar to a pipe but is instead sold as a registered security mezzanine capital main article mezzanine capital mezzanine capital refers to subordinated debt or preferred equity securities that often represent the most junior portion of a companys capital structure that is senior to the companys common equity this form of financing is often used by private equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion mezzanine capital which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon venture capital main article venture capital venture capital is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made typically in less mature companies for the launch of a seed or startup company early stage development or expansion of a business venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams venture capital is often subdivided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early stage capital used for the launch of startup companies to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth entrepreneurs often develop products and ideas that require substantial capital during the formative stages of their companies life cycles many entrepreneurs do not have sufficient funds to finance projects themselves and they must therefore seek outside financing the venture capitalists need to deliver high returns to compensate for the risk of these investments makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies being able to secure financing is critical to any business whether it is a startup seeking venture capital or a midsized firm that needs more cash to grow venture capital is most suitable for businesses with large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt although venture capital is often most closely associated with fastgrowing technology healthcare and biotechnology fields venture funding has been used for other more traditional businesses investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversiﬁed private equity portfolio but also to pursue the larger returns the strategy has the potential to offer however venture capital funds have produced lower returns for investors over recent years compared to other private equity fund types particularly buyout distressed and special situations main article distressed securities distressed or special situations is a broad category referring to investments in equity or debt securities of financially stressed companies the distressed category encompasses two broad substrategies including distressedtocontrol or loantoown strategies where the investor acquires debt securities in the hopes of emerging from a corporate restructuring in control of the companys equity special situations or turnaround strategies where an investor will provide debt and equity investments often rescue financing to companies undergoing operational or financial challenges in addition to these private equity strategies hedge funds employ a variety of distressed investment strategies including the active trading of loans and bonds issued by distressed companies secondaries main article private equity secondary market secondary investments refer to investments made in existing private equity assets these transactions can involve the sale of private equity fund interests or portfolios of direct investments in privately held companies through the purchase of these investments from existing institutional investors by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buy and hold investors secondary investments provide institutional investors with the ability to improve vintage diversification particularly for investors that are new to the asset class secondaries also typically experience a different cash flow profile diminishing the jcurve effect of investing in new private equity funds often investments in secondaries are made through third party fund vehicle structured similar to a fund of funds although many large institutional investors have purchased private equity fund interests through secondary transactions sellers of private equity fund investments

companies as investment vehicles to acquire portfolios of investments in corporate assets was a relatively new trend in the s popularized by the likes of warren buffett berkshire hathaway and victor posner dwg corporation and later adopted by nelson peltz triarc saul steinberg reliance insurance and gerry schwartz onex corporation these investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms in fact it is posner who is often credited with coining the term leveraged buyout or lbo the leveraged buyout boom of the s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers most notably jerome kohlberg jr and later his protégé henry kravis working for bear stearns at the time kohlberg and kravis along with kravis cousin george roberts began a series of what they described as bootstrap investments many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren clay  as well as thompson wire eagle motors and barrows through their investment

buyout in history the event was chronicled in the book and later the movie barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco kkr would eventually prevail in acquiring rjr nabisco at  per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that shearson lehman hutton would take rjr nabisco private at  per share a fierce series of negotiations and horsetrading ensued which pitted kkr

available to finance large leveraged buyouts july and august saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with few issuers accessing the market uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn however the expected rebound in the market after  may  did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing by the end of september the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including citigroup and ubs ag announced major writedowns due to credit losses the leveraged finance markets came to a near standstill during a week in  as  ended and  began it was clearby whom that lending standards had tightened and the era of megabuyouts had come to an end nevertheless private equity continues to be a large and active asset class and the private equity firms with hundreds of billions of dollars of committed capital from investors are looking to deploy capital in new and different transactionscitation needed as a result of the global financial crisis private equity has become subject to increased regulation in europe and is now subject among other things to rules preventing asset stripping of portfolio companies and requiring the notification and disclosure of information in connection with buyout activity investments in private equity diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund although the capital for private equity originally came from individual investors or corporations in the s private equity became an asset class in which various institutional investors allocated capital in the hopes of achieving risk adjusted returns that exceed those possible in the public equity markets in the s insurers were major private equity investors later public pension funds and university and other endowments became more significant sources of capital for most institutional investors private equity investments are made as part of a broad asset allocation that includes traditional assets eg public equity and bonds and other alternative assets eg hedge funds real estate commodities investor categories us canadian and european public and private pension schemes have invested in the asset class since the early s to diversify away from their core holdings public equity and fixed income today pension investment in private equity accounts for more than a third of all monies allocated to the asset class ahead of other institutional investors such as insurance companies endowments and sovereign wealth funds direct vs indirect investment most institutional investors do not invest directly in privately held companies lacking the expertise and resources necessary to structure and monitor the investment instead institutional investors will invest indirectly through a private equity fund certain institutional investors have the scale necessary to develop a diversified portfolio of private equity funds themselves while others will invest through a fund of funds to allow a portfolio more diversified than one a single investor could construct investment timescales returns on private equity investments are created through one or a combination of three factors that include debt repayment or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid a key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time which will vary depending on the investment strategy private equity investments are typically realized through one of the following avenues an initial public offering ipo – shares of the company are offered to the public typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares a merger or acquisition – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company a recapitalization – cash is distributed to the shareholders in this case the financial sponsor and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution large institutional asset owners such as pension funds with typically longdated liabilities insurance companies sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of private equity investment the median horizon for a lbo transaction is  years liquidity in the private equity market diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest the buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund main article private equity secondary market the private equity secondary market also often called private equity secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets increasingly secondaries are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private equity investments as a result investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private equity programs driven by strong demand for private equity exposure a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lockup periods lack of transparency unlimited leverage concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of limited partnership interests – the most common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund sale of direct interests – secondary directs or synthetic secondaries this category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from

equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm becoming a limited partner in the fund rather than an investor in the firm itself as a result an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund in which it has invested fund of funds these are private equity funds that invest in other private equity funds in order to provide investors with a lower risk product through exposure to a large number of vehicles often of different type and regional focus fund of funds accounted for  of global commitments made to private equity funds in  individuals with substantial net worth substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law since private equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds for example in the us most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors which requires  million of net worth  of individual income or  of joint income with spouse for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue as fundraising has grown over the past few years so too has the number of investors in the average fund in  there were  investors in the average private equity fund this figure has now grown to  according to preqin ltd formerly known as private equity intelligence the managers of private equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles typically providing between – of the overall capital often private equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles the use of placement agents has grown over the past few years with  of funds closed in  employing their services according to preqin ltd placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager and will typically take a fee of around  of the commitments that they are able to garner the amount of time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer with managers of less popular fund types such as us and european venture fund managers in the current climate finding the fundraising process more tough it is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months once a fund has reached its fundraising target it will have a final close after this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on

funds increasingly sovereign wealth funds are growing as an investor class for private equity private equity fund performance due to limited disclosure studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult unlike mutual funds private equity funds need not disclose performance data and as they invest in private companies it is difficult to examine the underlying investments it is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized an oftcited academic paper kaplan and shoar  suggests that the netoffees returns to pe funds are roughly comparable to the sp  or even slightly under this analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias ie funds that fail wont report data one should also note that these returns are not riskadjusted a more recent paper harris jenkinson and kaplan  found that average buyout fund returns in the us have actually exceeded that of public markets these findings were supported by earlier work using a different data set robinson and sensoy  commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment it is also claimed that pe fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry two other findings in kaplan and schoar  first there is considerable variation in performance across pe funds second unlike the mutual fund industry there appears to be performance persistence in pe funds that is pe funds that perform well over one period tend to also perform well the next period persistence is stronger for vc firms than for lbo firms the application of the freedom of information act foia in certain states in the united states has made certain performance data more readily available specifically foia has required certain public agencies to disclose private equity performance data directly on their websites in the united kingdom the second largest market for private equity more data has become available since the  publication of the david walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency in private equity debate recording private equity there is a debate around the distinction between private equity and foreign direct investment fdi and whether to treat them separately the difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter or investorheld shares also known as freefloating shares the main point of contention is that fdi is used solely for production whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets at present most countries report private equity as a part of fdi cognitive bias private equity decisionmaking has been shown to suffer from cognitive biases such as illusion of control and overconfidence see also history of private equity and venture capital private investment in public equity publicly traded private equity specialized investment fund organizations private

strategies private equity firms may use are as follows leveraged buyout being the most important leveraged buyout main article leveraged buyout diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction leveraged buyout lbo or buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company business unit or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage the companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate operating cash flows private equity firms view target companies as either platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a standalone entity or as addon or tuckin acquisitions which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits leveraged buyouts involve a financial sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition to do this the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments acquisition debt in an lbo is often nonrecourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor therefore an lbo transactions financial structure is particularly attractive to a funds limited partners allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage this kind of financing structure leverage benefits an lbos financial sponsor in two ways  the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition and  the returns to the investor will be enhanced as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt as a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target market conditions the willingness of lenders to extend credit both to the lbos financial sponsors and the company to be acquired as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to cover those costs historically the debt portion of a lbo will range from – of the purchase price although during certain periods the debt ratio can be higher or lower than the historical averages between – debt averaged between  and  of total purchase price for lbos in the united states simple example of leveraged buyout a private equity fund say for example abc capital ii borrows bn from a bank or other lender to this it adds bn of equity – money from its own partners and from limited partners pension funds rich individuals etc with this bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company xyz industrial after due diligence ie checking the books it replaces the senior management in xyz industrial and they set out to streamline it the workforce is reduced some assets are sold off etc the objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale the stock market is experiencing a bull market and xyz industrial is sold two years after the buyout for bn yielding a profit of bn the original loan can now be paid off with interest of say bn the remaining profit of bn is shared among the partners taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates note that part of that profit results from turning the company around and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market the latter often being the greater component notes the lenders the people who put up the bn in the example can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk or by buying credit default swaps cdss or selling collateralised debt obligations cdos fromto other institutions although this is no business of the private equity firm often the loanequity bn above is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company xyz industrial for it to pay off over time this can be advantageous since the interest is typically offsettable against the profits of the company thus reducing or even eliminating tax most buyout deals are much smaller the global average purchase in  was m for example the target company xyz industrials here does not have to be floated on the stockmarket indeed most buyout exits are not iposcitation needed buyout operations can go wrong and in such cases the loss is increased by leverage just as the profit is if all goes wellcitation needed growth capital main article growth capital growth capital refers to equity investments most often minority investments in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle these companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions acquisitions or other investments because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion sales and marketing initiatives equipment purchases and new product development the primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone by selling part of the company to private equity the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a companys balance sheet particularly to reduce the amount of leverage or debt the company has on its balance sheet a private investment in public equity or pipes refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company pipe investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time the registered direct or rd is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital a registered direct is similar to a pipe but is instead sold as a registered security mezzanine capital main article mezzanine capital mezzanine capital refers to subordinated debt or preferred equity securities that often represent the most junior portion of a companys capital structure that is senior to the companys common equity this form of financing is often used by private equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion mezzanine capital which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon venture capital main article venture capital venture capital is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made typically in less mature companies for the launch of a seed or startup company early stage development or expansion of a business venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams venture capital is often subdivided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early stage capital used for the launch of startup companies to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth entrepreneurs often develop products and ideas that require substantial capital during the formative stages of their companies life cycles many entrepreneurs do not have sufficient funds to finance projects themselves and they must therefore seek outside financing the venture capitalists need to deliver high returns to compensate for the risk of these investments makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies being able to secure financing is critical to any business whether it is a startup seeking venture capital or a midsized firm that needs more cash to grow venture capital is most suitable for businesses with large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt although venture capital is often most closely associated with fastgrowing technology healthcare and biotechnology fields venture funding has been used for other more traditional businesses investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversiﬁed private equity portfolio but also to pursue the larger returns the strategy has the potential to offer however venture capital funds have produced lower returns for investors over recent years compared to other private equity fund types particularly buyout distressed and special situations main article distressed securities distressed or special situations is a broad category referring to investments in equity or debt securities of financially stressed companies the distressed category encompasses two broad substrategies including distressedtocontrol or loantoown strategies where the investor acquires debt securities in the hopes of emerging from a corporate restructuring in control of the companys equity special situations or turnaround strategies where an investor will provide debt and equity investments often rescue financing to companies undergoing operational or financial challenges in addition to these private equity strategies hedge funds employ a variety of distressed investment strategies including the active trading of loans and bonds issued by distressed companies secondaries main article private equity secondary market secondary investments refer to investments made in existing private equity assets these transactions can involve the sale of private equity fund interests or portfolios of direct investments in privately held companies through the purchase of these investments from existing institutional investors by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buy and hold investors secondary investments provide institutional investors with the ability to improve vintage diversification particularly for investors that are new to the asset class secondaries also typically experience a different cash flow profile diminishing the jcurve effect of investing in new private equity funds often investments in secondaries are made through third party fund vehicle structured similar to a fund of funds although many large institutional investors have purchased private equity fund interests through secondary transactions sellers of private equity fund investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds other strategies other strategies that can be considered private equity or a close adjacent market include real estate in the context of private equity this will typically refer to the riskier end of the investment spectrum including value added and opportunity funds where the investments often more closely resemble leveraged buyouts than traditional real estate investments certain investors in private equity consider real estate to be a separate asset class infrastructure investments in various public works eg bridges tunnels toll roads airports public transportation and other public works that are made typically as part of a privatization initiative on the part of a government

the deal closed  million of waterman cash and assets were used to retire  million of the loan debt similar to the approach employed in the mclean transaction the use of publicly traded holding companies as investment vehicles to acquire portfolios of investments in corporate assets was a relatively new trend in the s popularized by the likes of warren buffett berkshire hathaway and victor posner dwg corporation and later adopted by nelson peltz triarc saul steinberg reliance insurance and gerry schwartz onex corporation these investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms in fact it is posner who is often credited with coining the term leveraged buyout or lbo the leveraged buyout boom of the s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers most notably jerome kohlberg jr and later his protégé henry kravis working for bear stearns at the time kohlberg and kravis along with kravis cousin george roberts began a series of what they described as bootstrap investments many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren clay  as well as thompson wire eagle motors and barrows through their investment

between  and  it was estimated that there were over  leveraged buyouts valued in excess of  million during the s constituencies within acquired companies and the media ascribed the corporate raid label to many private equity investments particularly those that featured a hostile takeover of the company perceived asset stripping major layoffs or other significant corporate restructuring activities among the most notable investors to be labeled corporate raiders in the s included carl icahn victor posner nelson peltz robert m bass t boone pickens harold clark simmons kirk kerkorian

clients of michael milken whose investment banking firm drexel burnham lambert helped raise blind pools of capital with which corporate raiders could make a legitimate attempt to take over a company and provided highyield debt junk bonds financing of the buyouts one of the final major buyouts of the s proved to be its most ambitious and marked both a highwater mark and a sign of the beginning of the end of the boom that had begun nearly a decade earlier in  kkr kohlberg kravis roberts closed in on a  billion takeover of rjr nabisco it was at that time and for over  years the largest leverage buyout in history the event was chronicled in the book and later the movie barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco kkr would eventually prevail in acquiring rjr nabisco at  per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that shearson lehman hutton would take rjr nabisco private at  per share a fierce series of negotiations and horsetrading ensued which pitted kkr against shearson and later forstmann little  co many of the major banking players of the day including morgan stanley goldman sachs salomon brothers and merrill lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties after shearsons original bid kkr quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain rjr nabisco for  per share—a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of rjr nabiscos management rjrs management team working with shearson and salomon brothers submitted a bid of  a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by kraviss team kkrs

history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed that for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco by the end of the s the excesses of the buyout market were beginning to show with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts including robert campeaus  buyout of federated department stores the  buyout of the revco drug stores walter industries feb trucking and eaton leonard additionally the rjr nabisco deal was showing signs of strain leading to a recapitalization in  that involved the contribution of  billion of new equity from kkr in the end kkr lost  million on rjr drexel reached an agreement with the

available to finance large leveraged buyouts july and august saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with few issuers accessing the market uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn however the expected rebound in the market after  may  did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing by the end of september the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including citigroup and ubs ag announced major writedowns due to credit losses the leveraged finance markets came to a near standstill during a week in  as  ended and  began it was clearby whom that lending standards had tightened and the era of megabuyouts had come to an end nevertheless private equity continues to be a large and active asset class and the private equity firms with hundreds of billions of dollars of committed capital from investors are looking to deploy capital in new and different transactionscitation needed as a result of the global financial crisis private equity has become subject to increased regulation in europe and is now subject among other things to rules preventing asset stripping of portfolio companies and requiring the notification and disclosure of information in connection with buyout activity investments in private equity diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund although the capital for private equity originally came from individual investors or corporations in the s private equity became an asset class in which various institutional investors allocated capital in the hopes of achieving risk adjusted returns that exceed those possible in the public equity markets in the s insurers were major private equity investors later public pension funds and university and other endowments became more significant sources of capital for most institutional investors private equity investments are made as part of a broad asset allocation that includes traditional assets eg public equity and bonds and other alternative assets eg hedge funds real estate commodities investor categories us canadian and european public and private pension schemes have invested in the asset class since the early s to diversify away from their core holdings public equity and fixed income today pension investment in private equity accounts for more than a third of all monies allocated to the asset class ahead of other institutional investors such as insurance companies endowments and sovereign wealth funds direct vs indirect investment most institutional investors do not invest directly in privately held companies lacking the expertise and resources necessary to structure and monitor the investment instead institutional investors will invest indirectly through a private equity fund certain institutional investors have the scale necessary to develop a diversified portfolio of private equity funds themselves while others will invest through a fund of funds to allow a portfolio more diversified than one a single investor could construct investment timescales returns on private equity investments are created through one or a combination of three factors that include debt repayment or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid a key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time which will vary depending on the investment strategy private equity investments are typically realized through one of the following avenues an initial public offering ipo – shares of the company are offered to the public typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares a merger or acquisition – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company a recapitalization – cash is distributed to the shareholders in this case the financial sponsor and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution large institutional asset owners such as pension funds with typically longdated liabilities insurance companies sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of private equity investment the median horizon for a lbo transaction is  years liquidity in the private equity market diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest the buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund main article private equity secondary market the private equity secondary market also often called private equity secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets increasingly secondaries are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private equity investments as a result investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private equity programs driven by strong demand for private equity exposure a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lockup periods lack of transparency unlimited leverage concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of limited partnership interests – the most common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund sale of direct interests – secondary directs or synthetic secondaries this category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from

fund of funds accounted for  of global commitments made to private equity funds in  individuals with substantial net worth substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law since private equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds for example in the us most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors which requires  million of net worth  of individual income or  of joint income with spouse for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue as fundraising has grown over the past few years so too has the number of investors in the average fund in  there were  investors in the average private equity fund this figure has now grown to  according to preqin ltd formerly known as private equity intelligence the managers of private equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles typically providing between – of the overall capital often private equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles the use of placement agents has grown over the past few years with  of funds closed in  employing their services according to preqin ltd placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager and will typically take a fee of around  of the commitments that they are able to garner the amount of time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer with managers of less popular fund types such as us and european venture fund managers in the current climate finding the fundraising process more tough it is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months once a fund has reached its fundraising target it will have a final close after this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on

previous year including unrealised funds in existing investments private equity funds under management probably totalled over  trillion public pensions are a major source of capital for private equity funds increasingly sovereign wealth funds are growing as an investor class for private equity private equity fund performance due to limited disclosure studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult unlike mutual funds private equity funds need not disclose performance data and as they invest in private companies it is difficult to examine the underlying investments it is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized an oftcited academic paper kaplan and shoar  suggests that the netoffees returns to pe funds are roughly comparable to the sp  or even slightly under this analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias ie funds that fail wont report data one should also note that these returns are not riskadjusted a more recent paper harris jenkinson and kaplan  found that average buyout fund returns in the us have actually exceeded that of public markets these findings were supported by earlier work using a different data set robinson and sensoy  commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment it is also claimed that pe fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry two other findings in kaplan and schoar  first there is considerable variation in performance across pe funds second unlike the mutual fund industry there appears to be performance persistence in pe funds that is pe funds that perform well over one period tend to also perform well the next period persistence is stronger for vc firms than for lbo firms the application of the freedom of information act foia in certain states in the united states has made certain performance data more readily available specifically foia has required certain public agencies to disclose private equity performance data directly on their websites in the united kingdom the second largest market for private equity more data has become available since the  publication of the david walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency in private equity debate recording private equity there is a debate around the distinction between private equity and foreign direct investment fdi and whether to treat them separately the difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter or investorheld shares also known as freefloating shares the main point of contention is that fdi is used solely for production whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets at present most countries report private equity as a part of fdi cognitive bias private equity decisionmaking has been shown to suffer from cognitive biases such as illusion of control and overconfidence see also history of private equity and venture capital private investment in public equity publicly traded private equity specialized investment fund organizations private

strategies private equity firms may use are as follows leveraged buyout being the most important leveraged buyout main article leveraged buyout diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction leveraged buyout lbo or buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company business unit or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage the companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate operating cash flows private equity firms view target companies as either platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a standalone entity or as addon or tuckin acquisitions which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits leveraged buyouts involve a financial sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition to do this the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments acquisition debt in an lbo is often nonrecourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor therefore an lbo transactions financial structure is particularly attractive to a funds limited partners allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage this kind of financing structure leverage benefits an lbos financial sponsor in two ways  the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition and  the returns to the investor will be enhanced as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt as a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target market conditions the willingness of lenders to extend credit both to the lbos financial sponsors and the company to be acquired as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to cover those costs historically the debt portion of a lbo will range from – of the purchase price although during certain periods the debt ratio can be higher or lower than the historical averages between – debt averaged between  and  of total purchase price for lbos in the united states simple example of leveraged buyout a private equity fund say for example abc capital ii borrows bn from a bank or other lender to this it adds bn of equity – money from its own partners and from limited partners pension funds rich individuals etc with this bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company xyz industrial after due diligence ie checking the books it replaces the senior management in xyz industrial and they set out to streamline it the workforce is reduced some assets are sold off etc the objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale the stock market is experiencing a bull market and xyz industrial is sold two years after the buyout for bn yielding a profit of bn the original loan can now be paid off with interest of say bn the remaining profit of bn is shared among the partners taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates note that part of that profit results from turning the company around and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market the latter often being the greater component notes the lenders the people who put up the bn in the example can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk or by buying credit default swaps cdss or selling collateralised debt obligations cdos fromto other institutions although this is no business of the private equity firm often the loanequity bn above is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company xyz industrial for it to pay off over time this can be advantageous since the interest is typically offsettable against the profits of the company thus reducing or even eliminating tax most buyout deals are much smaller the global average purchase in  was m for example the target company xyz industrials here does not have to be floated on the stockmarket indeed most buyout exits are not iposcitation needed buyout operations can go wrong and in such cases the loss is increased by leverage just as the profit is if all goes wellcitation needed growth capital main article growth capital growth capital refers to equity investments most often minority investments in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle these companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions acquisitions or other investments because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion sales and marketing initiatives equipment purchases and new product development the primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone by selling part of the company to private equity the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a companys balance sheet particularly to reduce the amount of leverage or debt the company has on its balance sheet a private investment in public equity or pipes refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company pipe investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time the registered direct or rd is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital a registered direct is similar to a pipe but is instead sold as a registered security mezzanine capital main article mezzanine capital mezzanine capital refers to subordinated debt or preferred equity securities that often represent the most junior portion of a companys capital structure that is senior to the companys common equity this form of financing is often used by private equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion mezzanine capital which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon venture capital main article venture capital venture capital is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made typically in less mature companies for the launch of a seed or startup company early stage development or expansion of a business venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams venture capital is often subdivided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early stage capital used for the launch of startup companies to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth entrepreneurs often develop products and ideas that require substantial capital during the formative stages of their companies life cycles many entrepreneurs do not have sufficient funds to finance projects themselves and they must therefore seek outside financing the venture capitalists need to deliver high returns to compensate for the risk of these investments makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies being able to secure financing is critical to any business whether it is a startup seeking venture capital or a midsized firm that needs more cash to grow venture capital is most suitable for businesses with large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt although venture capital is often most closely associated with fastgrowing technology healthcare and biotechnology fields venture funding has been used for other more traditional businesses investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversiﬁed private equity portfolio but also to pursue the larger returns the strategy has the potential to offer however venture capital funds have produced lower returns for investors over recent years compared to other private equity fund types particularly buyout distressed and special situations main article distressed securities distressed or special situations is a broad category referring to investments in equity or debt securities of financially stressed companies the distressed category encompasses two broad substrategies including distressedtocontrol or loantoown strategies where the investor acquires debt securities in the hopes of emerging from a corporate restructuring in control of the companys equity special situations or turnaround strategies where an investor will provide debt and equity investments often rescue financing to companies undergoing operational or financial challenges in addition to these private equity strategies hedge funds employ a variety of distressed investment strategies including the active trading of loans and bonds issued by distressed companies secondaries main article private equity secondary market secondary investments refer to investments made in existing private equity assets these transactions can involve the sale of private equity fund interests or portfolios of direct investments in privately held companies through the purchase of these investments from existing institutional investors by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buy and hold investors secondary investments provide institutional investors with the ability to improve vintage diversification particularly for investors that are new to the asset class secondaries also typically experience a different cash flow profile diminishing the jcurve effect of investing in new private equity funds often investments in secondaries are made through third party fund vehicle structured similar to a fund of funds although many large institutional investors have purchased private equity fund interests through secondary transactions sellers of private equity fund investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds other strategies other strategies that can be considered private equity or a close adjacent market include real estate in the context of private equity this will typically refer to the riskier end of the investment spectrum including value added and opportunity funds where the investments often

companies as investment vehicles to acquire portfolios of investments in corporate assets was a relatively new trend in the s popularized by the likes of warren buffett berkshire hathaway and victor posner dwg corporation and later adopted by nelson peltz triarc saul steinberg reliance insurance and gerry schwartz onex corporation these investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms in fact it is posner who is often credited with coining the term leveraged buyout or lbo the leveraged buyout boom of the s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers most notably jerome kohlberg jr and later his protégé henry kravis working for bear stearns at the time kohlberg and kravis along with kravis cousin george roberts began a series of what they described as bootstrap investments many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren clay  as well as thompson wire eagle motors and barrows through their investment

buyout in history the event was chronicled in the book and later the movie barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco kkr would eventually prevail in acquiring rjr nabisco at  per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that shearson lehman hutton would take rjr nabisco private at  per share a fierce series of negotiations and horsetrading ensued which pitted kkr

advising and financing the parties after shearsons original bid kkr quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain rjr nabisco for  per share—a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of

buyouts including robert campeaus  buyout of federated department stores the  buyout of the revco drug stores walter industries feb trucking and eaton leonard additionally the rjr nabisco deal was

available to finance large leveraged buyouts july and august saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with few issuers accessing the market uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn however the expected rebound in the market after  may  did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing by the end of september the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including citigroup and ubs ag announced major writedowns due to credit losses the leveraged finance markets came to a near standstill during a week in  as  ended and  began it was clearby whom that lending standards had tightened and the era of megabuyouts had come to an end nevertheless private equity continues to be a large and active asset class and the private equity firms with hundreds of billions of dollars of committed capital from investors are looking to deploy capital in new and different transactionscitation needed as a result of the global financial crisis private equity has become subject to increased regulation in europe and is now subject among other things to rules preventing asset stripping of portfolio companies and requiring the notification and disclosure of information in connection with buyout activity investments in private equity diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund although the capital for private equity originally came from individual investors or corporations in the s private equity became an asset class in which various institutional investors allocated capital in the hopes of achieving risk adjusted returns that exceed those possible in the public equity markets in the s insurers were major private equity investors later public pension funds and university and other endowments became more significant sources of capital for most institutional investors private equity investments are made as part of a broad asset allocation that includes traditional assets eg public equity and bonds and other alternative assets eg hedge funds real estate commodities investor categories us canadian and european public and private pension schemes have invested in the asset class since the early s to diversify away from their core holdings public equity and fixed income today pension investment in private equity accounts for more than a third of all monies allocated to the asset class ahead of other institutional investors such as insurance companies endowments and sovereign wealth funds direct vs indirect investment most institutional investors do not invest directly in privately held companies lacking the expertise and resources necessary to structure and monitor the investment instead institutional investors will invest indirectly through a private equity fund certain institutional investors have the scale necessary to develop a diversified portfolio of private equity funds themselves while others will invest through a fund of funds to allow a portfolio more diversified than one a single investor could construct investment timescales returns on private equity investments are created through one or a combination of three factors that include debt repayment or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid a key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time which will vary depending on the investment strategy private equity investments are typically realized through one of the following avenues an initial public offering ipo – shares of the company are offered to the public typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares a merger or acquisition – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company a recapitalization – cash is distributed to the shareholders in this case the financial sponsor and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution large institutional asset owners such as pension funds with typically longdated liabilities insurance companies sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of private equity investment the median horizon for a lbo transaction is  years liquidity in the private equity market diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest the buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund main article private equity secondary market the private equity secondary market also often called private equity secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets increasingly secondaries are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private equity investments as a result investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private equity programs driven by strong demand for private equity exposure a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lockup periods lack of transparency unlimited leverage concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of limited partnership interests – the most common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund sale of direct interests – secondary directs or synthetic secondaries this category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from either corporate development programs or large financial institutions private equity firms main articles private equity firm and list of private equity firms according to an updated  ranking created

equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm becoming a limited partner in the fund rather than an investor in the firm itself as a result an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund in which it has invested fund of funds these are private equity funds that invest in other private equity funds in order to provide investors with a lower risk product through exposure to a large number of vehicles often of different type and regional focus fund of funds accounted for  of global commitments made to private equity funds in  individuals with substantial net worth substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law since private equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds for example in the us most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors which requires  million of net worth  of individual income or  of joint income with spouse for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue as fundraising has grown over the past few years so too has the number of investors in the average fund in  there were  investors in the average private equity fund this figure has now grown to  according to preqin ltd formerly known as private equity intelligence the managers of private equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles typically providing between – of the overall capital often private equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles the use of placement agents has grown over the past few years with  of funds closed in  employing their services according to preqin ltd placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager and will typically take a fee of around  of the commitments that they are able to garner the amount of time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer with managers of less popular fund types such as us and european venture fund managers in the current climate finding the fundraising process more tough it is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months once a fund has reached its fundraising target it will have a final close after this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on

funds increasingly sovereign wealth funds are growing as an investor class for private equity private equity fund performance due to limited disclosure studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult unlike mutual funds private equity funds need not disclose performance data and as they invest in private companies it is difficult to examine the underlying investments it is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized an oftcited academic paper kaplan and shoar  suggests that the netoffees returns to pe funds are roughly comparable to the sp  or even slightly under this analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias ie funds that fail wont report data one should also note that these returns are not riskadjusted a more recent paper harris jenkinson and kaplan  found that average buyout fund returns in the us have actually exceeded that of public markets these findings were supported by earlier work using a different data set robinson and sensoy  commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment it is also claimed that pe fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry two other findings in kaplan and schoar  first there is considerable variation in performance across pe funds second unlike the mutual fund industry there appears to be performance persistence in pe funds that is pe funds that perform well over one period tend to also perform well the next period persistence is stronger for vc firms than for lbo firms the application of the freedom of information act foia in certain states in the united states has made certain performance data more readily available specifically foia has required certain public agencies to disclose private equity performance data directly on their websites in the united kingdom the second largest market for private equity more data has become available since the  publication of the david walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency in private equity debate recording private equity there is a debate around the distinction between private equity and foreign direct investment fdi and whether to treat them separately the difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter or investorheld shares also known as freefloating shares the main point of contention is that fdi is used solely for production whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets at present most countries report private equity as a part of fdi cognitive bias private equity decisionmaking has been shown to suffer from cognitive biases such as illusion of

performance  debate  recording private equity  cognitive bias  see also  organizations  notes  further reading  external links strategies the strategies private equity firms may use are as follows leveraged buyout being the most important leveraged buyout main article leveraged buyout diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction leveraged buyout lbo or buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company business unit or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage the companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate operating cash flows private equity firms view target companies as either platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a standalone entity or as addon or tuckin acquisitions which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits leveraged buyouts involve a financial sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition to do this the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments acquisition debt in an lbo is often nonrecourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor therefore an lbo transactions financial structure is particularly attractive to a funds limited partners allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage this kind of financing structure leverage benefits an lbos financial sponsor in two ways  the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition and  the returns to the investor will be enhanced as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt as a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target market conditions the willingness of lenders to extend credit both to the lbos financial sponsors and the company to be acquired as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to cover those costs historically the debt portion of a lbo will range from – of the purchase price although during certain periods the debt ratio can be higher or lower than the historical averages between – debt averaged between  and  of total purchase price for lbos in the united states simple example of leveraged buyout a private equity fund say for example abc capital ii borrows bn from a bank or other lender to this it adds bn of equity – money from its own partners and from limited partners pension funds rich individuals etc with this bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company xyz industrial after due diligence ie checking the books it replaces the senior management in xyz industrial and they set out to streamline it the workforce is reduced some assets are sold off etc the objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale the stock market is experiencing a bull market and xyz industrial is sold two years after the buyout for bn yielding a profit of bn the original loan can now be paid off with interest of say bn the remaining profit of bn is shared among the partners taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates note that part of that profit results from turning the company around and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market the latter often being the greater component notes the lenders the people who put up the bn in the example can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk or by buying credit default swaps cdss or selling collateralised debt obligations cdos fromto other institutions although this is no business of the private equity firm often the loanequity bn above is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company xyz industrial for it to pay off over time this can be advantageous since the interest is typically offsettable against the profits of the company thus reducing or even eliminating tax most buyout deals are much smaller the global average purchase in  was m for example the target company xyz industrials here does not have to be floated on the stockmarket indeed most buyout exits are not iposcitation needed buyout operations can go wrong and in such cases the loss is increased by leverage just as the profit is if all goes wellcitation needed growth capital main article growth capital growth capital refers to equity investments most often minority investments in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle these companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions acquisitions or other investments because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion sales and marketing initiatives equipment purchases and new product development the primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone by selling part of the company to private equity the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a companys balance sheet particularly to reduce the amount of leverage or debt the company has on its balance sheet a private investment in public equity or pipes refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company pipe investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time the registered direct or rd is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital a registered direct is similar to a pipe but is instead sold as a registered security mezzanine capital main article mezzanine capital mezzanine capital refers to subordinated debt or preferred equity securities that often represent the most junior portion of a companys capital structure that is senior to the companys common equity this form of financing is often used by private equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion mezzanine capital which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon venture capital main article venture capital venture capital is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made typically in less mature companies for the launch of a seed or startup company early stage development or expansion of a business venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams venture capital is often subdivided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early stage capital used for the launch of startup companies to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth entrepreneurs often develop products and ideas that require substantial capital during the formative stages of their companies life cycles many entrepreneurs do not have sufficient funds to finance projects themselves and they must therefore seek outside financing the venture capitalists need to deliver high returns to compensate for the risk of these investments makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies being able to secure financing is critical to any business whether it is a startup seeking venture capital or a midsized firm that needs more cash to grow venture capital is most suitable for businesses with large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt although venture capital is often most closely associated with fastgrowing technology healthcare and biotechnology fields venture funding has been used for other more traditional businesses investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversiﬁed private equity portfolio but also to pursue the larger returns the strategy has the potential to offer however venture capital funds have produced lower returns for investors over recent years compared to other private equity fund types particularly buyout distressed and special situations main article distressed securities distressed or special situations is a broad category referring to investments in equity or debt securities of financially stressed companies the distressed category encompasses two broad substrategies including distressedtocontrol or loantoown strategies where the investor acquires debt securities in the hopes of emerging from a corporate restructuring in control of the companys equity special situations or turnaround strategies where an investor will provide debt and equity investments often rescue financing to companies undergoing operational or financial challenges in addition to these private equity strategies hedge funds employ a variety of distressed investment strategies including the active trading of loans and bonds issued by distressed companies secondaries main article private equity secondary market secondary investments refer to investments made in existing private equity assets these transactions can involve the sale of private equity fund interests or portfolios of direct investments in privately held companies through the purchase of these investments from existing institutional investors by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buy and hold investors secondary investments provide institutional investors with the ability to improve vintage diversification particularly for investors that are new to the asset class secondaries also typically experience a different cash flow profile diminishing the jcurve effect of investing in new private equity funds often investments in secondaries are made through third party fund vehicle structured similar to a fund of funds although many large institutional investors have purchased private equity fund interests through secondary transactions sellers of private equity fund investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds other strategies other strategies that can be considered private equity or a close adjacent market include real estate in the context of private equity this will typically refer to the riskier end of the investment spectrum including value added and opportunity funds where the investments often more closely resemble leveraged buyouts than traditional real estate investments certain investors in private equity consider real estate to be a separate asset class infrastructure investments in various public works eg bridges tunnels toll roads airports public transportation and other public works that are made typically as part of a privatization initiative on the part of a government entity energy and power investments in a wide variety of companies rather than assets engaged in the production and sale of energy including fuel extraction manufacturing refining and distribution energy or companies engaged in the production or

of waterman cash and assets were used to retire  million of the loan debt similar to the approach employed in the mclean transaction the use of publicly traded holding companies as investment vehicles to acquire portfolios of investments in corporate assets was a relatively new trend in the s popularized by the likes of warren buffett berkshire hathaway and victor posner dwg corporation and later adopted by nelson peltz triarc saul steinberg reliance insurance and gerry schwartz onex corporation these investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms in fact it is posner who is often credited with coining the term leveraged buyout or lbo the leveraged buyout boom of the s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers most notably jerome kohlberg jr and later his protégé henry kravis working for bear stearns at the time kohlberg and kravis along with kravis cousin george roberts began a series of what they described as bootstrap investments many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren clay  as well as thompson wire eagle motors and barrows through their investment in stern metals by  tensions had built up between bear stearns and kohlberg kravis and roberts leading to their departure and the formation of kohlberg kravis roberts in that year private equity in the s main articles history of private

greeting cards for  million of which only  million was rumored to have been contributed by the investors by mid just sixteen months after the original deal gibson completed a  million ipo and simon made approximately  million the success of the gibson greetings investment attracted the attention of the wider media to the nascent boom in leveraged buyouts between  and  it was estimated that there were over  leveraged buyouts valued in excess of  million during the s constituencies within acquired companies and the media ascribed the corporate raid label to many private equity investments particularly those that featured a hostile takeover of the company perceived asset stripping major layoffs or other significant corporate restructuring activities among the most notable investors to be labeled corporate raiders in the s included carl icahn victor posner nelson peltz robert m bass t boone pickens harold clark simmons kirk kerkorian sir james goldsmith saul steinberg and asher edelman carl icahn developed a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider after his hostile takeover of twa in  many of the corporate raiders were onetime clients of michael milken whose investment banking firm drexel burnham lambert helped raise blind pools of capital with which corporate raiders could make a legitimate attempt to take over a company and provided highyield debt junk bonds financing of the buyouts one of the final major buyouts of the s proved to be its most ambitious and marked both a highwater mark and a sign of the beginning of the end of the boom that had begun nearly a decade earlier in  kkr kohlberg kravis roberts closed in on a  billion takeover of rjr nabisco it was at that time and for over  years the largest leverage buyout in history the event was chronicled in the book and later the movie barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco kkr would eventually prevail in acquiring rjr nabisco at  per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that shearson lehman hutton would take rjr nabisco private at  per share a fierce series of negotiations and horsetrading ensued which pitted kkr against shearson and later forstmann little  co many of the major banking players of the day including morgan stanley goldman sachs salomon brothers and merrill lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties after shearsons original bid kkr quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain rjr nabisco for  per share—a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of rjr nabiscos management rjrs management team working with shearson and salomon brothers submitted a bid of  a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by kraviss team kkrs final bid of  while a lower dollar figure was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of rjr nabisco at  billion of transaction value rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyouts in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed that for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco by the end of the s the excesses of the buyout market were beginning to show with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts including robert campeaus  buyout of federated department stores the  buyout of the revco drug stores walter industries feb trucking and eaton leonard additionally the rjr nabisco deal was showing signs of strain leading to a recapitalization in  that involved the contribution of  billion of new equity from kkr in the end kkr lost  million on rjr drexel reached an agreement with the government in which it pleaded nolo

or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid a key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time which will vary depending on the investment strategy private equity investments are typically realized through one of the following avenues an initial public offering ipo – shares of the company are offered to the public typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares a merger or acquisition – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company a recapitalization – cash is distributed to the shareholders in this case the financial sponsor and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution large institutional asset owners such as pension funds with typically longdated liabilities insurance companies sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of private equity investment the median horizon for a lbo transaction is  years liquidity in the private equity market diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest the buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund main article private equity secondary market the private equity secondary market also often called private equity secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets increasingly secondaries are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private equity investments as a result investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private equity programs driven by strong demand for private equity exposure a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lockup periods lack of transparency unlimited leverage concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of limited partnership interests – the most common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund sale of direct interests – secondary directs or synthetic secondaries this category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from either corporate development programs or large financial institutions private equity firms main articles private equity firm and list of private equity firms according to an updated  ranking created by industry

equity firms differ to those of hedge funds typically private equity investment groups are geared towards longhold multipleyear investment strategies in illiquid assets whole companies largescale real estate projects or other tangibles not easily converted to cash where they have more control and influence over operations or asset management to influence their longterm returns hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash and they do not have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing both private equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions private equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management private equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets mezzanine financing for startup

equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm becoming a limited partner in the fund rather than an investor in the firm itself as a result an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund in which it has invested fund of funds these are private equity funds that invest in other private equity funds in order to provide investors with a lower risk product through exposure to a large number of vehicles often of different type and regional focus fund of funds accounted for  of global commitments made to private equity funds in  individuals with substantial net worth substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law since private equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds for example in the us most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors which requires  million of net worth  of individual income or  of joint income with spouse for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue as fundraising has grown over the past few years so too has the number of investors in the average fund in  there were  investors in the average private equity fund this figure has now grown to  according to preqin ltd formerly known as private equity intelligence the managers of private equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles typically providing between – of the overall capital often private equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles the use of placement agents has grown over the past few years with  of funds closed in  employing their services according to preqin ltd placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager and will typically take a fee of around  of the commitments that they are able to garner the amount of time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer with managers of less popular fund types such as us and european venture fund managers in the current climate finding the fundraising process more tough it is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months once a fund has reached its fundraising target it will have a final close after this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on

previous year including unrealised funds in existing investments private equity funds under management probably totalled over  trillion public pensions are a major source of capital for private equity funds increasingly sovereign wealth funds are growing as an investor class for private equity private equity fund performance due to limited disclosure studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult unlike mutual funds private equity funds need not disclose performance data and as they invest in private companies it is difficult to examine the underlying investments it is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized an oftcited academic paper kaplan and shoar  suggests that the netoffees returns to pe funds are roughly comparable to the sp  or even slightly under this analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias ie funds that fail wont report data one should also note that these returns are not riskadjusted a more recent paper harris jenkinson and kaplan  found that average buyout fund returns in the us have actually exceeded that of public markets these findings were supported by earlier work using a different data set robinson and sensoy  commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment it is also claimed that pe fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry two other findings in kaplan and schoar  first there is considerable variation in performance across pe funds second unlike the mutual fund industry there appears to be performance persistence in pe funds that is pe funds that perform well over one period tend to also perform well the next period persistence is stronger for vc firms than for lbo firms the application of the freedom of information act foia in certain states in the united states has made certain performance data more readily available specifically foia has required certain public agencies to disclose private equity performance data directly on their websites in the united kingdom the second largest market for private equity more data has become available since the  publication of the david walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency in private equity debate recording private equity there is a debate around the distinction between private equity and foreign direct investment fdi and whether to treat them separately the difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter or investorheld shares also known as freefloating shares the main point of contention is that fdi is used solely for production whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets at present most countries report private equity as a part of fdi cognitive bias private equity decisionmaking has been shown to suffer from cognitive biases such as illusion of control and overconfidence see also history of private equity and venture capital private investment in public equity publicly traded private equity specialized investment fund organizations private

strategies private equity firms may use are as follows leveraged buyout being the most important leveraged buyout main article leveraged buyout diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction leveraged buyout lbo or buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company business unit or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage the companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate operating cash flows private equity firms view target companies as either platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a standalone entity or as addon or tuckin acquisitions which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits leveraged buyouts involve a financial sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition to do this the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments acquisition debt in an lbo is often nonrecourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor therefore an lbo transactions financial structure is particularly attractive to a funds limited partners allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage this kind of financing structure leverage benefits an lbos financial sponsor in two ways  the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition and  the returns to the investor will be enhanced as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt as a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target market conditions the willingness of lenders to extend credit both to the lbos financial sponsors and the company to be acquired as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to cover those costs historically the debt portion of a lbo will range from – of the purchase price although during certain periods the debt ratio can be higher or lower than the historical averages between – debt averaged between  and  of total purchase price for lbos in the united states simple example of leveraged buyout a private equity fund say for example abc capital ii borrows bn from a bank or other lender to this it adds bn of equity – money from its own partners and from limited partners pension funds rich individuals etc with this bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company xyz industrial after due diligence ie checking the books it replaces the senior management in xyz industrial and they set out to streamline it the workforce is reduced some assets are sold off etc the objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale the stock market is experiencing a bull market and xyz industrial is sold two years after the buyout for bn yielding a profit of bn the original loan can now be paid off with interest of say bn the remaining profit of bn is shared among the partners taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates note that part of that profit results from turning the company around and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market the latter often being the greater component notes the lenders the people who put up the bn in the example can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk or by buying credit default swaps cdss or selling collateralised debt obligations cdos fromto other institutions although this is no business of the private equity firm often the loanequity bn above is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company xyz industrial for it to pay off over time this can be advantageous since the interest is typically offsettable against the profits of the company thus reducing or even eliminating tax most buyout deals are much smaller the global average purchase in  was m for example the target company xyz industrials here does not have to be floated on the stockmarket indeed most buyout exits are not iposcitation needed buyout operations can go wrong and in such cases the loss is increased by leverage just as the profit is if all goes wellcitation needed growth capital main article growth capital growth capital refers to equity investments most often minority investments in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle these companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions acquisitions or other investments because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion sales and marketing initiatives equipment purchases and new product development the primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone by selling part of the company to private equity the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a companys balance sheet particularly to reduce the amount of leverage or debt the company has on its balance sheet a private investment in public equity or pipes refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company pipe investments

capital a registered direct is similar to a pipe but is instead sold as a registered security mezzanine capital main article mezzanine capital mezzanine capital refers to subordinated debt or preferred equity securities that often represent the most junior portion of a companys capital structure that is senior to the companys common equity this form of financing is often used by private equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion mezzanine capital which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon venture capital main article venture capital venture capital is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made typically in less mature companies for the launch of a seed or startup company early stage development or expansion of a business venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams venture capital is often subdivided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early stage capital used for the launch of startup companies to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth entrepreneurs often develop products and ideas that require substantial capital during the formative stages of their companies life cycles many entrepreneurs do not have sufficient funds to finance projects themselves and they must therefore seek outside financing the venture capitalists need to deliver high returns to compensate for the risk of these investments makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies being able to secure financing is critical to any business whether it is a startup seeking venture capital or a midsized firm that needs more cash to grow venture capital is most suitable for businesses with large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt although venture capital is often most closely associated with fastgrowing technology healthcare and biotechnology fields venture funding has been used for other more traditional businesses investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversiﬁed private equity portfolio but also to pursue the larger returns the strategy has the potential to offer however venture capital funds have produced lower returns for investors over recent

posner dwg corporation and later adopted by nelson peltz triarc saul steinberg reliance insurance and gerry schwartz onex corporation these investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms in fact it is posner who is often credited with coining the term leveraged buyout or lbo the leveraged buyout boom of the s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers most notably jerome kohlberg jr and later his protégé henry kravis working for bear stearns at the time kohlberg and kravis along with kravis cousin george roberts began a series of what they described as bootstrap investments many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren clay  as well as thompson wire eagle motors and barrows through their investment

 as  ended and  began it was clearby whom that lending standards had tightened and the era of megabuyouts had come to an end nevertheless private equity continues to be a large and active asset class and the private equity firms with hundreds of billions of dollars of committed capital from investors are looking to deploy capital in new and different transactionscitation needed as a result of the global financial crisis private equity has become subject to increased regulation in europe and is now subject among other things to rules preventing asset stripping of portfolio companies and requiring the notification and disclosure of information in connection with buyout activity investments in private equity diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund although the capital for private equity originally came from individual investors or corporations in the s private equity became an asset class in which various institutional investors allocated capital in the hopes of achieving risk adjusted returns that exceed those possible in the public equity markets in the s insurers were major private equity investors later public pension funds and university and other endowments became more significant sources of capital for most institutional investors private equity investments are made as part of a broad asset allocation that includes traditional assets eg public equity and bonds and other alternative assets eg hedge funds real estate commodities investor categories us canadian and european public and private pension schemes have invested in the asset class since the early s to diversify away from their core holdings public equity and fixed income today pension investment in private equity accounts for more than a third of all monies allocated to the asset class ahead of other institutional investors such as insurance companies endowments and sovereign wealth funds direct vs indirect investment most institutional investors do not invest directly in privately held companies lacking the expertise and resources necessary to structure and monitor the investment instead institutional investors will invest indirectly through a private equity fund certain institutional investors have the scale necessary to develop a diversified portfolio of private equity funds themselves while others will invest through a fund of funds to allow a portfolio more diversified than one a single investor could construct investment timescales returns on private equity investments are created through one or a combination of three factors that include debt repayment or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid a key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time which will vary depending on the investment strategy private equity investments are typically realized through one of the following avenues an initial public offering ipo – shares of the company are offered to the public typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares a merger or acquisition – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company a recapitalization – cash is distributed to the shareholders in this case the financial sponsor and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution large institutional asset owners such as pension funds with typically longdated liabilities insurance companies sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of private equity investment the median horizon for a lbo transaction is  years liquidity in the private equity market diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund

equity secondary market also often called private equity secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets increasingly secondaries are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private equity investments as a result investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private equity programs driven by strong demand for private equity exposure a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lockup periods lack of transparency unlimited leverage concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of limited partnership interests – the most common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund sale of direct interests – secondary directs or synthetic secondaries this category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from

equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm becoming a limited partner in the fund rather than an investor in the firm itself as a result an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund in which it has invested fund of funds these are private equity funds that invest in other private equity funds in order to provide investors with a lower risk product through exposure to a large number of vehicles often of different type and regional focus fund of funds accounted for  of global commitments made to private equity funds in  individuals with substantial net worth substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law since private equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds for example in the us most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors which requires  million of net worth  of individual income or  of joint income with spouse for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue as fundraising has grown over the past few years so too has

intelligence the managers of private equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles typically providing between – of the overall capital often private equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles the use of placement agents has grown over the past few years with  of funds closed in  employing their services according to preqin ltd placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager and will typically take a fee of around  of the commitments that they are able to garner the amount of time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer with managers of less popular fund types such as us and european venture fund managers in the current climate finding the fundraising process more tough it is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months once a fund has reached its fundraising target it will have a final close after this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on

funds increasingly sovereign wealth funds are growing as an investor class for private equity private equity fund performance due to limited disclosure studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult unlike mutual funds private equity funds need not disclose performance data and as they invest in private companies it is difficult to examine the underlying investments it is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized an oftcited academic paper kaplan and shoar  suggests that the netoffees returns to pe funds are roughly comparable to the sp  or even slightly under this analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias ie funds that fail wont report data one should also note that these returns are not riskadjusted a more recent paper harris jenkinson and kaplan  found that average buyout fund returns in the us have actually exceeded that of public markets these findings were supported by earlier work using a different data set robinson and sensoy  commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment it is also claimed that pe fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry two other findings in kaplan and schoar  first there is considerable variation in performance across pe funds second unlike the mutual fund industry there appears to be performance persistence in pe funds that is pe funds that perform well over one period tend to also perform well the next period persistence is stronger for vc firms than for lbo firms the application of the freedom of information act foia in certain states in the united states has made certain performance data more readily available specifically foia has required certain public agencies to disclose private equity performance data directly on their websites in the united kingdom the second largest market for private equity more data has become available since the  publication of the david walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency in private equity debate recording private equity there is a debate around the distinction between private equity and foreign direct investment fdi and whether to treat them separately the difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter or investorheld shares also known as freefloating shares the main point of contention is that fdi is used solely for production whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets at present most countries report private equity as a part of fdi cognitive bias private equity decisionmaking has been shown to suffer from cognitive biases such as illusion of

strategies private equity firms may use are as follows leveraged buyout being the most important leveraged buyout main article leveraged buyout diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction leveraged buyout lbo or buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company business unit or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage the companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate operating cash flows private equity firms view target companies as either platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a standalone entity or as addon or tuckin acquisitions which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits leveraged buyouts involve a financial sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition to do this the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments acquisition debt in an lbo is often nonrecourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor therefore an lbo transactions financial structure is particularly attractive to a funds limited partners allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage this kind of financing structure leverage benefits an lbos financial sponsor in two ways  the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition and  the returns to the investor will be enhanced as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt as a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target market conditions the willingness of lenders to extend credit both to the lbos financial sponsors and the company to be acquired as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to cover those costs historically the debt portion of a lbo will range from – of the purchase price although during certain periods the debt ratio can be higher or lower than the historical averages between – debt averaged between  and  of total purchase price for lbos in the united states simple example of leveraged buyout a private equity fund say for example abc capital ii borrows bn from a bank or other lender to this it adds bn of equity – money from its own partners and from limited partners pension funds rich individuals etc with this bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company xyz industrial after due diligence ie checking the books it replaces the senior management in xyz industrial and they set out to streamline it the workforce is reduced some assets are sold off etc the objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale the stock market is experiencing a bull market and xyz industrial is sold two years after the buyout for bn yielding a profit of bn the original loan can now be paid off with interest of say bn the remaining profit of bn is shared among the partners taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates note that part of that profit results from turning the company around and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market the latter often being the greater component notes the lenders the people who put up the bn in the example can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk or by buying credit default swaps cdss or selling collateralised debt obligations cdos fromto other institutions although this is no business of the private equity firm often the loanequity bn above is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company xyz industrial for it to pay off over time this can be advantageous since the interest is typically offsettable against the profits of the company thus reducing or even eliminating tax most buyout deals are much smaller the global average purchase in  was m for example the target company xyz industrials here does not have to be floated on the stockmarket indeed most buyout exits are not iposcitation needed buyout operations can go wrong and in such cases the loss is increased by leverage just as the profit is if all goes wellcitation needed growth capital main article growth capital growth capital refers to equity investments most often minority investments in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle these companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions acquisitions or other investments because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion sales and marketing initiatives equipment purchases and new product development the primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone by selling part of the company to private equity the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a companys balance sheet particularly to reduce the amount of leverage or debt the company has on its balance sheet a private investment in public equity or pipes refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company pipe investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time the registered direct or rd is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital a registered direct is similar to a pipe but is instead sold as a registered security mezzanine capital main article mezzanine capital mezzanine capital refers to subordinated debt or preferred equity securities that often represent the most junior portion of a companys capital structure that is senior to the companys common equity this form of financing is often used by private equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion mezzanine capital which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon venture capital main article venture capital venture capital is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made typically in less mature companies for the launch of a seed or startup company early stage development or expansion of a business venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams venture capital is often subdivided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early stage capital used for the launch of startup companies to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth entrepreneurs often develop products and ideas that require substantial capital during the formative stages of their companies life cycles many entrepreneurs do not have sufficient funds to finance projects themselves and they must therefore seek outside financing the venture capitalists need to deliver high returns to compensate for the risk of these investments makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies being able to secure financing is critical to any business whether it is a startup seeking venture capital or a midsized firm that needs more cash to grow venture capital is most suitable for businesses with large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt although venture capital is often most closely associated with fastgrowing technology healthcare and biotechnology fields venture funding has been used for other more traditional businesses investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversiﬁed private equity portfolio but also to pursue the larger returns the strategy has the potential to offer however venture capital funds have produced lower returns for investors over recent years compared to other private equity fund types particularly buyout distressed and special situations main article distressed securities distressed or special situations is a broad category referring to investments in equity or debt securities of financially stressed companies the distressed category encompasses two broad substrategies including distressedtocontrol or loantoown strategies where the investor acquires debt securities in the hopes of emerging from a corporate restructuring in control of the companys equity special situations or turnaround strategies where an investor will provide debt and equity investments often rescue financing to companies undergoing operational or financial challenges in addition to these private equity strategies hedge funds employ a variety of distressed investment strategies including the active trading of loans and bonds issued by distressed companies secondaries main article private equity secondary market secondary investments refer to investments made in existing private equity assets these transactions can involve the sale of private equity fund interests or portfolios of direct investments in privately held companies through the purchase of these investments from existing institutional investors by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buy and hold investors secondary investments provide institutional investors with the ability to improve vintage diversification particularly for investors that are new to the asset class secondaries also typically experience a different cash flow profile diminishing the jcurve effect of investing in new private equity funds often investments in secondaries are made through third party fund vehicle structured similar to a fund of funds although many large institutional investors have purchased private equity fund interests through secondary transactions sellers of private equity fund investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds other strategies other strategies that can be considered private equity or a close adjacent market include real estate in the context of private equity this will typically refer to the riskier end of the investment spectrum including value added and opportunity funds where the investments often more closely resemble leveraged buyouts than traditional real estate investments certain investors in private equity consider real estate to be a separate asset class infrastructure investments in various public works eg bridges tunnels toll roads airports public transportation and other public works that are made typically as part of a privatization initiative on the part of a government entity energy and power investments in a wide variety of companies rather than assets engaged in the production and sale of energy including fuel extraction manufacturing refining and distribution

the deal closed  million of waterman cash and assets were used to retire  million of the loan debt similar to the approach employed in the mclean transaction the use of publicly traded holding companies as investment vehicles to acquire portfolios of investments in corporate assets was a relatively new trend in the s popularized by the likes of warren buffett berkshire hathaway and victor posner dwg corporation and later adopted by nelson peltz triarc saul steinberg reliance insurance and gerry schwartz onex corporation these investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms in fact it is posner who is often credited with coining the term leveraged buyout or lbo the leveraged buyout boom of the s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers most notably jerome kohlberg jr and later his protégé henry kravis working for bear stearns at the time kohlberg and kravis along with kravis cousin george roberts began a series of what they described as bootstrap investments many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren clay  as well as thompson wire eagle motors and barrows through their investment in stern metals by  tensions had built up between bear stearns and kohlberg kravis and roberts leading to their departure and the formation of kohlberg kravis roberts in that year private equity in

gibson greetings a producer of greeting cards for  million of which only  million was rumored to have been contributed by the investors by mid just sixteen months after the original deal gibson completed a  million ipo and simon made approximately  million the success of the gibson greetings investment attracted the attention of the wider media to the nascent boom in leveraged buyouts between  and  it was estimated that there were over  leveraged buyouts valued in excess of  million during the s constituencies within acquired companies and the media ascribed the corporate raid label to many private equity investments particularly those that featured a hostile takeover of the company perceived asset stripping major layoffs or other significant corporate restructuring activities among the most notable investors to be labeled corporate raiders in the s included carl icahn victor posner nelson peltz robert m bass t boone pickens harold clark simmons kirk kerkorian sir james goldsmith saul steinberg and asher edelman carl icahn developed a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider after his hostile takeover of twa in  many of the corporate raiders were onetime clients of michael milken whose investment banking firm drexel burnham lambert helped raise blind pools of capital with which corporate raiders could make a legitimate attempt to take over a company and provided highyield debt junk bonds financing of the buyouts one of the final major buyouts of the s proved to be its most ambitious and marked both a highwater mark and a sign of the beginning of the end of the boom that had begun nearly a decade earlier in  kkr kohlberg kravis roberts closed in on a  billion takeover of rjr nabisco it was at that time and for over  years the largest leverage buyout in history the event was chronicled in the book and later the movie barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco kkr would eventually prevail in acquiring rjr nabisco at  per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that shearson lehman hutton would take rjr nabisco private at  per share a fierce series of negotiations and horsetrading ensued which pitted kkr against shearson and later forstmann little  co many of the major banking players of the day including morgan stanley goldman sachs salomon brothers and merrill lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties after shearsons original bid kkr quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain rjr nabisco for  per share—a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of rjr nabiscos management rjrs management team working with shearson and salomon brothers submitted a bid of  a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by kraviss team kkrs final bid of  while a lower dollar figure was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of rjr nabisco at  billion of transaction value rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyouts in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed that for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco by the end of the s the excesses of the buyout market were beginning to show with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts including robert campeaus  buyout of federated department stores the  buyout of the revco drug stores walter industries feb trucking and eaton leonard additionally the rjr nabisco deal was showing signs of strain leading to a recapitalization in  that involved the contribution of  billion of new equity from kkr in the end kkr lost  million on rjr drexel reached an agreement with the government in which it pleaded nolo contendere no contest to six felonies – three counts of stock parking and three counts of stock manipulation it also agreed to pay a fine of  million – at the time

available to finance large leveraged buyouts july and august saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with few issuers accessing the market uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn however the expected rebound in the market after  may  did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing by the end of september the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including citigroup and ubs ag announced major writedowns due to credit losses the leveraged finance markets came to a near standstill during a week in  as  ended and  began it was clearby whom that lending standards had tightened and the era of megabuyouts had come to an end nevertheless private equity continues to be a large and active asset class and the private equity firms with hundreds of billions of dollars of committed capital from investors are looking to deploy capital in new and different transactionscitation needed as a result of the global financial crisis private equity has become subject to increased regulation in europe and is now subject among other things to rules preventing asset stripping of portfolio companies and requiring the notification and disclosure of information in connection with buyout activity investments in private equity diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund although the capital for private equity originally came from individual investors or corporations in the s private equity became an asset class in which various institutional investors allocated capital in the hopes of achieving risk adjusted returns that exceed those possible in the public equity markets in the s insurers were major private equity investors later public pension funds and university and other endowments became more significant sources of capital for most institutional investors private equity investments are made as part of a broad asset allocation that includes traditional assets eg public equity and bonds and other alternative assets eg hedge funds real estate commodities investor categories us canadian and european public and private pension schemes have invested in the asset class since the early s to diversify away from their core holdings public equity and fixed income today pension investment in private equity accounts for more than a third of all monies allocated to the asset class ahead of other institutional investors such as insurance companies endowments and sovereign wealth funds direct vs indirect investment most institutional investors do not invest directly in privately held companies lacking the expertise and resources necessary to structure and monitor the investment instead institutional investors will invest indirectly through a private equity fund certain institutional investors have the scale necessary to develop a diversified portfolio of private equity funds themselves while others will invest through a fund of funds to allow a portfolio more diversified than one a single investor could construct investment timescales returns on private equity investments are created through one or a combination of three factors that include debt repayment or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid a key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time which will vary depending on the investment strategy private equity investments are typically realized through one of the following avenues an initial public offering ipo – shares of the company are offered to the public typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares a merger or acquisition – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company a recapitalization – cash is distributed to the shareholders in this case the financial sponsor and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution large institutional asset owners such as pension funds with typically longdated liabilities insurance companies sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of private equity investment the median horizon for a lbo transaction is  years liquidity in the private equity market diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund

equity secondary market also often called private equity secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets increasingly secondaries are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private equity investments as a result investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private equity programs driven by strong demand for private equity exposure a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lockup periods lack of transparency unlimited leverage concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of limited partnership interests – the most common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund sale of direct interests – secondary directs or synthetic secondaries this category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from either corporate development programs or large financial institutions private equity firms main articles private equity firm and list of private equity firms according to an updated  ranking created

global management tpg capital cvc capital partners general atlantic ares management clayton dubilier  rice advent international because private equity firms are continuously in the process of raising

equity firms differ to those of hedge funds typically private equity investment groups are geared towards longhold multipleyear investment strategies in illiquid assets whole companies largescale real estate projects or other tangibles not easily converted to cash where they have more control and influence over operations or asset management to influence their longterm returns hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash and they do not have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing both private equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions private equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management private equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets mezzanine financing for startup projects growth capital investments in existing businesses or leveraged buyout of a publicly held asset converting it to private control finally private equity firms only take long positions for short

equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm becoming a limited partner in the fund rather than an investor in the firm itself as a result an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund in which it has invested fund of funds these are private equity funds that invest in other private equity funds in order to provide investors with a lower risk product through exposure to a large number of vehicles often of different type and regional focus fund of funds accounted for  of global commitments made to private equity funds in  individuals with substantial net worth substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law since private equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds for example in the us most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors which requires  million of net worth  of individual income or  of joint income with spouse for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue as fundraising has grown over the past few years so too has the number of investors in the average fund in  there were  investors in the average private equity fund this figure has now grown to  according to preqin ltd formerly known as private equity intelligence the managers of private equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles typically providing between – of the overall capital often private equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles the use of placement agents has grown over the past few years with  of funds closed in  employing their services according to preqin ltd placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager and will typically take a fee of around  of the commitments that they are able to garner the amount of time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer with managers of less popular fund types such as us and european venture fund managers in the current climate finding the fundraising process more tough it is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months once a fund has reached its fundraising target it will have a final close after this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on

previous year including unrealised funds in existing investments private equity funds under management probably totalled over  trillion public pensions are a major source of capital for private equity funds increasingly sovereign wealth funds are growing as an investor class for private equity private equity fund performance due to limited disclosure studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult unlike mutual funds private equity funds need not disclose performance data and as they invest in private companies it is difficult to examine the underlying investments it is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized an oftcited academic paper kaplan and shoar  suggests that the netoffees returns to pe funds are roughly comparable to the sp  or even slightly under this analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias ie funds that fail wont report data one should also note that these returns are not riskadjusted a more recent paper harris jenkinson and kaplan  found that average buyout fund returns in the us have actually exceeded that of public markets these findings were supported by earlier work using a different data set robinson and sensoy  commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment it is also claimed that pe fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry two other findings in kaplan and schoar  first there is considerable variation in performance across pe funds second unlike the mutual fund industry there appears to be performance persistence in pe funds that is pe funds that perform well over one period tend to also perform well the next period persistence is stronger for vc firms than for lbo firms the application of the freedom of information act foia in certain states in the united states has made certain performance data more readily available specifically foia has required certain public agencies to disclose private equity performance data directly on their websites in the united kingdom the second largest market for private equity more data has become available since the  publication of the david walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency in private equity debate recording private equity there is a debate around the distinction between private equity and foreign direct investment fdi and whether to treat them separately the difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter or investorheld shares also known as freefloating shares the main point of contention is that fdi is used solely for production whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets at present most countries report private equity as a part of fdi cognitive bias private equity decisionmaking has been shown to suffer from cognitive biases such as illusion of control and overconfidence see also history of private equity and venture capital private investment in public equity publicly traded private equity specialized investment fund organizations private

use are as follows leveraged buyout being the most important leveraged buyout main article leveraged buyout diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction leveraged buyout lbo or buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company business unit or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage the companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate operating cash flows private equity firms view target companies as either platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a standalone entity or as addon or tuckin acquisitions which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits leveraged buyouts involve a financial sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition to do this the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments acquisition debt in an lbo is often nonrecourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor therefore an lbo transactions financial structure is particularly attractive to a funds limited partners allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage this kind of financing structure leverage benefits an lbos financial sponsor in two ways  the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition and  the returns to the investor will be enhanced as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt as a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target market conditions the willingness of lenders to extend credit both to the lbos financial sponsors and the company to be acquired as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to cover those costs historically the debt portion of a lbo will range from – of the purchase price although during certain periods the debt ratio can be higher or lower than the historical averages between – debt averaged between  and  of total purchase price for lbos in the united states simple example of leveraged buyout a private equity fund say for example abc capital ii borrows bn from a bank or other lender to this it adds bn of equity – money from its own partners and from limited partners pension funds rich individuals etc with this bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company xyz industrial after due diligence ie checking the books it replaces the senior management in xyz industrial and they set out to streamline it the workforce is reduced some assets are sold off etc the objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale the stock market is experiencing a bull market and xyz industrial is sold two years after the buyout for bn yielding a profit of bn the original loan can now be paid off with interest of say bn the remaining profit of bn is shared among the partners taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates note that part of that profit results from turning the company around and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market the latter often being the greater component notes the lenders the people who put up the bn in the example can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk or by buying credit default swaps cdss or selling collateralised debt obligations cdos fromto other institutions although this is no business of the private equity firm often the loanequity bn above is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company xyz industrial for it to pay off over time this can be advantageous since the interest is typically offsettable against the profits of the company thus reducing or even eliminating tax most buyout deals are much smaller the global average purchase in  was m for example the target company xyz industrials here does not have to be floated on the stockmarket indeed most buyout exits are not iposcitation needed buyout operations can go wrong and in such cases the loss is increased by leverage just as the profit is if all goes wellcitation needed growth capital main article growth capital growth capital refers to equity investments most often minority investments in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle these companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions acquisitions or other investments because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion sales and marketing initiatives equipment purchases and new product development the primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone by selling part of the company to private equity the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a companys balance sheet particularly to reduce the amount of leverage or debt the company has on its balance sheet a private investment in public equity or pipes refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company pipe investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time the registered direct or rd is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital a registered direct is similar to a pipe but is instead sold as a registered security mezzanine capital main article mezzanine capital mezzanine capital refers to subordinated debt or preferred equity securities that often represent the most junior portion of a companys capital structure that is senior to the companys common equity this form of financing is often used by private equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion mezzanine capital which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon venture capital main article venture capital venture capital is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made typically in less mature companies for the launch of a seed or startup company early stage development or expansion of a business venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams venture capital is often subdivided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early stage capital used for the launch of startup companies to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth entrepreneurs often develop products and ideas that require substantial capital during the formative stages of their companies life cycles many entrepreneurs do not have sufficient funds to finance projects themselves and they must therefore seek outside financing the venture capitalists need to deliver high returns to compensate for the risk of these investments makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies being able to secure financing is critical to any business whether it is a startup seeking venture capital or a midsized firm that needs more cash to grow venture capital is most suitable for businesses with large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt although venture capital is often most closely associated with fastgrowing technology healthcare and biotechnology fields venture funding has been used for other more traditional businesses investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversiﬁed private equity portfolio but

adopted by nelson peltz triarc saul steinberg reliance insurance and gerry schwartz onex corporation these investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms in fact it is posner who is often credited with coining the term leveraged buyout or lbo the leveraged buyout boom of the s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers most notably jerome kohlberg jr and later his protégé henry kravis working for bear stearns at the time kohlberg and kravis along with kravis cousin george roberts began a series of what they described as bootstrap investments many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren clay  as well as thompson wire eagle motors and barrows through their investment in stern metals by  tensions had built up

chronicled in the book and later the movie barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco kkr would eventually prevail in acquiring rjr nabisco at  per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that shearson lehman hutton would take rjr nabisco private at  per share a fierce series of negotiations and horsetrading ensued which pitted kkr against shearson and later

private equity has become subject to increased regulation in europe and is now subject among other things to rules preventing asset stripping of portfolio companies and requiring the notification and disclosure of information in connection with buyout activity investments in private equity diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund although the capital for private equity originally came from individual investors or corporations in the s private equity became an asset class in which various institutional investors allocated capital in the hopes of achieving risk adjusted returns that exceed those possible in the public equity markets in the s insurers were major private equity investors later public pension funds and university and other endowments became more significant sources of capital for most institutional investors private equity investments are made as part of a broad asset allocation that includes traditional assets eg public equity and bonds and other alternative assets eg hedge funds real estate commodities investor categories us canadian and european public and private pension schemes have invested in the asset class since the early s to diversify away from their core holdings public equity and fixed income today pension investment in private equity accounts for more than a third of all monies allocated to the asset class ahead of other institutional investors such as insurance companies endowments and sovereign wealth funds direct vs indirect investment most institutional investors do not invest directly in privately held companies lacking the expertise and resources necessary to structure and monitor the investment instead institutional investors will invest indirectly through a private equity fund certain institutional investors have the scale necessary to develop a diversified portfolio of private equity funds themselves while others will invest through a fund of funds to allow a portfolio more diversified than one a single investor could construct investment timescales returns on private equity investments are created through one or a combination of three factors that include debt repayment or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid a key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time which will vary depending on the investment strategy private equity investments are typically realized through one of the following avenues an initial public offering ipo – shares of the company are offered to the public typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares a merger or acquisition – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company a recapitalization – cash is distributed to the shareholders in this case the financial sponsor and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution large institutional asset owners such as pension funds with typically longdated liabilities insurance companies sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of

secondary market also often called private equity secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets increasingly secondaries are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private equity investments as a result investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private equity programs driven by strong demand for private equity exposure a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lockup periods lack of transparency unlimited leverage concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of limited partnership interests – the most common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund sale of direct interests – secondary directs or synthetic secondaries this category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from either corporate

equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm becoming a limited partner in the fund rather than an investor in the firm itself as a result an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund in which it has invested fund of funds these are private equity funds that invest in other private equity funds in order to provide investors with a lower risk product through exposure to a large number of vehicles often of different type and regional focus fund of funds accounted for  of global commitments made to private equity funds in  individuals with substantial net worth substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law since private equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds for example in the us most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors which requires  million of net worth  of individual income or  of joint income with spouse for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue as fundraising has grown over the past few years so too has

intelligence the managers of private equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles typically providing between – of the overall capital often private equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles the use of placement agents has grown over the past few years with  of funds closed in  employing their services according to preqin ltd placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager and will typically take a fee of around  of the commitments that they are able to garner the amount of time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer with managers of less popular fund types such as us and european venture fund managers in the current climate finding the fundraising process more tough it is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months once a fund has reached its fundraising target it will have a final close after this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on

funds increasingly sovereign wealth funds are growing as an investor class for private equity private equity fund performance due to limited disclosure studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult unlike mutual funds private equity funds need not disclose performance data and as they invest in private companies it is difficult to examine the underlying investments it is challenging to compare private equity performance to public equity performance in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized an oftcited academic paper kaplan and shoar  suggests that the netoffees returns to pe funds are roughly comparable to the sp  or even slightly under this analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias ie funds that fail wont report data one should also note that these returns are not riskadjusted a more recent paper harris jenkinson and kaplan  found that average buyout fund returns in the us have actually exceeded that of public markets these findings were supported by earlier work using a different data set robinson and sensoy  commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment it is also claimed that pe fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry two other findings in kaplan and schoar  first there is considerable variation in performance across pe funds second unlike the mutual fund industry there appears to be performance persistence in pe funds that is pe funds that perform well over one period tend to also perform well the next period persistence is stronger for vc firms than for lbo firms the application of the freedom of information act foia in certain states in the united states has made certain performance data more readily available specifically foia has required certain public agencies to disclose private equity performance data directly on their websites in the united kingdom the second largest market for private equity more data has become available since the  publication of the david walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency in private equity debate recording private equity there is a debate around the distinction between private equity and foreign direct investment fdi and whether to treat them separately the difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter or investorheld shares also known as freefloating shares the main point of contention is that fdi is used solely for production whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets at present most countries report private equity as a part of fdi cognitive bias private equity decisionmaking has been shown to suffer from cognitive biases such as illusion of
