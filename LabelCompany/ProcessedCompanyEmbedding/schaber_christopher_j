ceo leadership series christopher j schaber phd president  ceo soligenix inc ceo leadership series christopher j schaber phd president  ceo soligenix inc walking a tightrope between drug development and fundraising for christopher j schaber successfully helming soligenix inc involves walking a tightrope between developing a roster of promising drugs and raising the funds to pay for it recently listed on nasdaq soligenix is a latestage biopharmaceutical company based in princeton nj that focuses on two very specific areas—rare diseases and biodefense the company’s therapeutics segment is dedicated to the development of products for orphan diseases and areas of unmet medical need such as cutaneous tcell lymphoma oral mucositis pediatric crohn’s disease and acute radiation enteritis its biodefense segment develops vaccines and therapeutics for military and civilian applications in the areas of ricin exposure gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome and emerging and antibiotic resistant infectious disease to power soligenix’s product development pipeline dr schaber raises funds from a variety of sources including investors and the us government over the course of his career dr schaber has played a significant role in raising approximately  million for his organizations’ initiatives in an interview with ashton tweed dr schaber discusses the challenges of fundraising and how to manage the risks inherent in drug development soligenix focuses on both orphan diseases and biodefense vaccines how do these two areas complement each other the main focus of our company is the therapeutic side where we’re currently focused on cutaneous tcell lymphoma we’re actively recruiting for a phase iii trial of our product sgx which is a topical ointment containing synthetic hypericin sgx is applied directly to the malignant skin lesions and activated with safe visible fluorescent light we also have some very interesting data from a phase ii study with a product molecule called sgx containing the active ingredient dusquetide for the treatment of oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer the phase ii data was very promising and sets the stage for a phase iii trial in  so a lot of our time and energy has been put towards the therapeutic side specifically these two programs a lot of people don’t appreciate that in biodefense we’re really dealing with an area classified as orphan diseases by the fda unlike the typical rare disease where the patient population is extremely small in biodefense there’s no established patient population you’re waiting for—god forbid—a catastrophic event and at that point you could be treating thousands if not millions of people but up until a catastrophic event there’s obviously no market so it’s been a nice little model for us to build out a very diverse robust pipeline of technologies but also to work with the government and help to defray some of the expense which allows us to manage our cash burn very effectively why is government funding so important for soligenix our biodefense or vaccine business segment is funded entirely by the us government a lot of what we do on the biodefense side is focused on oversight we’ve got the proprietary technology and we’re ultimately the developers of it designing the required studies but we work through contract laboratories and facilities to oversee the execution so we’re fortunate enough to have good technology that we benefit from but not have to use the same level of internal resources to drive those forward like we do with the therapeutic side of our business we’ve received government funding up to approximately  million collectively across those two programs for ricin toxin exposure and gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome for a small business like soligenix there’s an overhead component that the government covers including facilityrelated expenses and reimbursement for certain portions of salaries for those directly working on the programs the government also pays a management fee to execute on the contract ranging from five to eight percent of the overall contract you can redirect those monies to wherever you’d like and we often times put those monies back into the therapeutic side of the business what have been your biggest challenges as ceo drug development in and of itself is a challenge you typically have more failures than successes in this business—it costs a lot of time energy and money to advance programs and at the end of the day some of them work and some of them don’t but you try to position yourself as best you can for success and i think we’ve done that because we have more than one drug candidate that has the potential to see approval in addition to the drug development risk it’s been very difficult in today’s markets for small biotech companies to get adequate funding to advance programs and have them reach the finish line we’ve moved programs along as quickly as we can and raised funding but we’ve been creative in utilizing other financial instruments like government grantscontracts the new jersey technology business tax certificate transfer nol program and partnerships to help us advance development while also offsetting some of our burn as well how many drugs do you currently have in the pipeline right now we have approximately six programs but we aren’t currently funding all six of those programs on the therapeutic side we’re driving forward two programs right now the cutaneous tcell lymphoma with sgx and the oral mucositis in head and neck cancer with sgx on the biodefense side we have our ricin toxin vaccine rivax™ and our orbeshield® therapeutic for gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome both of those programs have received funding by the government those four programs are the ones that we are advancing now and we’re waiting for additional funding opportunities for other programs in the pipeline as you’ve said soligenix raises money in a number of ways how do you tailor your fundraising efforts to the company’s products on the therapeutic side we’ve recently completed a partnership with sciclone pharmaceuticals for the greater china market we partnered sgx our oral mucositis program for head and neck cancer and received a nice upfront payment as part of that partnership now we’re looking to do that with all of our programs on the therapeutic side on the government contract side the end customer is the us government so you don’t need to build a commercial organization like you would typically need to do with a therapeutic program it’s just a matter of being able to manufacture the product and negotiate the pricing with the us government for what they may want to stockpile so because we don’t require that level of infrastructure to support a potential procurement contract we’ve kept the vaccinebiodefense business for ourselves to date ultimately if we are successful at the end of the day with our biodefense products we’ll sell those to the government at an agreedto price what advice would you give others about fundraising it all starts with good science you need to take a step back look at your program and say “is this something that would be of interest to the potential investor is there a need is there a clear development path forward what is the market opportunity and competitive landscape for the diseases you are targeting” once you feel you’ve passed that hurdle and have these important questions adequately answered then it’s a matter of conveying that story to potential investors where you think your story will resonate depending on your area then you can begin looking at resources such as government funding there’s a lot of funding through small business innovative research grants where you can at least start the process with some early drug development work and as you build data then hopefully there’s other opportunities for funding not only with the national institutes of health but also with other government agencies like the fda office of orphan products development in new jersey the nol program allows you to make money off your rd tax credits that’s worked well for us at times bringing in as much as half a million dollars or more to help offset our burn fundraising requires being as creative as possible not only in looking for individuals to invest in you but in looking at other instruments be it through government grants contracts the nol programs in new jersey or even debt financing in which you take a loan out to support development to a key inflection point and use your intellectual property as collateral—although that has the potential to be a little more risky how do you prepare for the possibility that a risk won’t pay off you prepare for the worst and you hope for the best when we had our phase ii doubleblind trial in oral mucositis enrolling we obviously didn’t know the outcome and didn’t have a large reservoir of cash because we didn’t have a large cash safety net so to speak if we did encounter a major stumbling block it would’ve been difficult to weather the storm we really walked a tightrope and luckily it paid off for us it’s always about trying to get to that next critical milestone the next key inflection point hopefully you have enough cash to get to the next one and sometimes it’s very tight we’ve had it work out more often than not where we’ve achieved that next milestone that allowed us to go out and bring in more cash or at least position ourselves to pursue a government contract or grant soligenix was listed on the nasdaq in december  why was that the right move for the company it was a bit of a painful process to get there but it’s ultimately been good when i joined soligenix it was on the overthecounter bulletin board which is a very difficult place to be the universe is much narrower on the bulletin board than on nasdaq you’re limited dramatically in the number and quality of investors that can buy bulletin board stock for compliance reasons so you really have a small audience to work with at the end of  we had an active phase iii program for sgx with data expected by the end of  we also had positive data in the oral mucositis program with plans to initiate phase iii in  and we also had a phase iii program in pediatric crohn’s disease cleared through the fda although we are not looking to execute on that trial until we identify an additional funding source so with these three advanced clinical programs plus government funding with tens of millions of dollars supporting good biodefense technology we thought now is the time to get the company off the bulletin board and onto nasdaq to open up that universe of investors hopefully if all goes according to plan in  we’ll start to increase our liquidity increase our stock price and position soligenix for success what’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned at soligenix when i first joined soligenix we essentially had one program in the pipeline and that program was a phase iii program that ultimately failed phase iii is that registration study where you submit for fda approval so obviously a failed phase iii study is not good we adapted our approach so that in the future we would try to get more than one program in the pipeline in order to have multiple shots on goal thereby mitigating risk we’re mitigating risk to the shareholders while we’re advancing multiple programs to build value one way to do that is through government grants and contracts in part to help offset development expense so we learned from the mistake of living and dying by one program or one study you need to have multiple technologies—if you can fund them—that provide for a more robust pipeline and a little bit more of a safety net for your investors what’s next for soligenix a lot of key milestones are coming up most notably the phase iii study in cutaneous tcell lymphoma we’re hopefully going to know by the end of the year where we stand with that study and if that study is successful we’ll look to file a new drug application with the fda in  we’ll also be actively enrolling in our oral mucositis phase iii study and we’ll have that study up and running if all goes according to plan in  that will hopefully not only mean good things for patients but also for shareholders ashton tweed would like to thank christopher

regarding dor please visit the companys website located at httpwwwdorbiopharmacom this press release contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  that reflect dor biopharma incs current expectations about its future results performance prospects and opportunities including statements regarding the potential use of orbecr for the treatment of gastrointestinal gvhd and the prospects for regulatory filings for orbecr where possible dor has tried to identify these forwardlooking statements by using words such as anticipates believes intends or similar expressions these statements are subject to a number of risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results in future periods to differ materially from what is expressed in or implied by these statements dor cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully develop or commercialize products based on its technology including orbecr particularly in light of the significant uncertainty inherent in developing vaccines against bioterror threats manufacturing and conducting preclinical and clinical trials of vaccines and obtaining regulatory approvals that its technologies will prove to be safe and effective that its cash expenditures will not exceed projected levels that it will be able to obtain future financing or funds when needed that product development and commercialization efforts will not be reduced or discontinued due to difficulties or delays in clinical trials or due to lack of progress or positive results from research and development efforts that it will be able to successfully obtain any further grants and awards maintain its existing grants which are subject to performance enter into any biodefense procurement contracts with the us government or other countries that it will be able to patent register or protect its technology from challenge and products from competition or maintain or expand its license agreements with its current licensors or that its business strategy will be successful important factors which may affect the future use of orbecr for gastrointestinal gvhd include the risks that because orbecr did not achieve statistical significance in its primary endpoint in the pivotal phase iii clinical study ie a pvalue of less than or equal to  the fda may not consider orbecr approvable based upon existing studies orbecr may not show therapeutic effect or an acceptable safety profile in future clinical trials if required or could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than dor expects or may never gain approval dor is dependent on the expertise effort priorities and contractual obligations of third parties in the clinical trials manufacturing marketing sales and distribution of its products or orbecr may not gain market acceptance and others may develop technologies or products superior to orbecr these and other factors are described from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission including but not limited to dors most recent reports on form qsb and form ksb dor assumes no obligation to update or revise any

biothreats dr christopher schaber orphan diseases associated with inflammation present excellent development opportunities for small biopharmaceutical companies and their investors additionally inflammatory conditions can result from treatment with cancer therapeutics the crossover between inflammation and oncology coupled with vaccine programs of high strategic value have allowed soligenix inc to build a significant pipeline with substantial revenue potential in this interview with the life sciences report dr christopher j schaber company president and ceo outlines development programs targeting pediatric crohn’s disease gi acute radiation syndrome a rare lymphoma and the threat of ricin relevant articles textron q earnings growth at bell and industrial drive overall revenues this

earnings review favorable business conditions and productivity improvements drive earnings growth currency headwinds result in another weak quarter for philip morris management qa view from the top the life sciences report soligenix inc sngxotcqb has a broad technology base covering inflammation oncology and biodefense from a development perspective how do you prioritize these target areas christopher schaber we structure our pipeline to individual development teams so that all programs are priorities however as you would imagine the development phase and timing to critical data play an important role in program prioritization we have two us food and drug administration fda fasttracked phase  pivotal trials that are set to begin in  one in pediatric crohn’s disease and the other in cutaneous tcell lymphoma ctcl both orphan indications in addition we have a phase  fasttracked trial in oral mucositis in headandneck cancer we expect data from this trial in mid due to their development status these inflammation and oncology programs are high priorities for  tlsr what are the targeted patient populations for your priorities in oncology inflammation and biodefense cs pediatric crohn’s disease affects approximately  k patients worldwide annually about k ctcl patients are diagnosed worldwide annually oral mucositis in headandneck cancer affects approximately k patients worldwide annually the biodefense patient population is more difficult to estimate because this population would be the result of a catastrophic event in events such as these the targeted population has the potential to be farreaching tlsr for pediatric crohn’s disease can you tell me about sgx cs sgx is a proprietary oral formulation of beclomethasone dipropionate bdp a steroid that acts topically along the gastrointestinal gi tract because it acts topically inflammation from the esophagus to the colon is reduced with minimal systemic exposure you get the antiinflammatory effects of the steroid without the potential for detrimental side effects—growth impairment bone demineralization—associated with systemic steroids furthermore sgx is a twotablet formulation comprising an immediaterelease bdp component for the esophagus and stomach and a delayedrelease bdp component for the small and large intestines the entire gi tract is treated regardless of where the inflammation is located tlsr what is the clinical development status of sgx cs we’re entering into a pivotal phase  clinical trial and are finalizing the protocol with the fda we expect to initiate this study in h with completion targeted for h tlsr will soligenix advance sgx to market or will the compound be partnered for commercial development cs as you would imagine phase  clinical programs typically receive business partnership interest however we’ve always been prepared to advance this program independently because pediatric crohn’s disease is an orphan indication tailormade for a small company to commercialize on its own with sgx for pediatric crohn’s disease representing a market opportunity of approximately  million m worldwide this is a great product for a small company like soligenix we continue to evaluate the value proposition for our shareholders though we are prepared to advance sgx ourselves we are open to a partnership in the future tlsr pediatric crohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease and inflammation is also a complication associated with various cancer therapies can you tell me about oral mucositis and sgx cs oral mucositis causes ulceration of the mouth tongue soft palate and oropharynx and is an extremely debilitating side effect of cancer radiotherapy andor chemotherapy it’s extremely painful causing an inability to eat reduced cancer treatment tolerance and increases in patient cost of care what is also known about oral mucositis is that it is linked to a dysregulation of the innate immune system that’s an important element because sgx a firstinclass synthetic amino acid innate defense regulator modulates the body’s innate defense system to treat disease we’ve generated a host of in vitro in vivo and preclinical animal data showing a consistent mechanism of action and a consistent response in treatment of oral mucositis and infection we have also demonstrated the safety of sgx in a phase  safety study in  healthy volunteers sgx is being evaluated in a phase  doseranging study that is currently enrolling we recently announced positive news regarding the trial in which the data review committee for the study recommended we narrow that trial down to a single blinded sgx and placebo study and enroll  more subjects the fact that our review committee recommended this small study gives us a level of cautious optimism that we’re going to see something important when the data is available in h tlsr you’re also developing sgx for radiation enteritis can you tell me about that program cs sgx is a delayedrelease oral bdp formulation we’re developing this formulation for treatment of lower gi inflammation caused by radiotherapy target patients may be cervical cancer or colon cancer patients receiving lower pelvic radiotherapy these patients when receiving radiation develop symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis by targeting inflammation we can deliver a necessary therapy with an improved safety profile compared to systemically absorbed therapeutic agents the current phase a study in sgx will not advance until additional government funding is available the phase  clinical trial was funded through a small business innovation research grant from the national cancer institute nci tlsr let’s transition from inflammation to cancer please describe sgx for ctcl cs ctcl is a rare class of nonhodgkin’s lymphoma in which malignant t cells migrate to the skin surface causing development of red lesions or patches sgx is synthetic hypericin an extremely potent photosensitizer it is applied topically to ctcl lesions and is activated by safe visible fluorescent light because there is no cure for ctcl therapies focus on management of the recurrent lesions of patients living with the disease currently offlabel use of the psoriasis drug puva psoralen with ultravioleta uva light is the most common treatment for early stage ctcl unfortunately the drug psoralen is mutagenic and uva light is carcinogenic sunlight sgx avoids treating cancer with cancercausing agents making it a potential firstline therapy with a significantly improved safety profile compared to puva given the m worldwide market potential for sgx in this orphan disease this is a nice addition to the soligenix portfolio tlsr biodefense seems to be the outlier in your target indications are there any pathologies or biological mechanisms that tie your biodefense programs to the cancer and inflammation programs cs the active ingredient for sgx and sgx is bdp this is also the active ingredient in our orbeshield program treating gi acute radiation syndrome in addition the synthetic amino acid peptide contained in sgx is also the active ingredient in our melioidosis program melioidosis is a lifethreatening infectious disease caused by gramnegative bacteria found in soil and water this is an orphan disease primarily found in thailand and northern australia when untreated the mortality rate is approximately  so there is synergy across the biotherapeutic and biodefense business units it’s important to note however that the biodefense business unit is fully funded by the government this allows us to build a robust pipeline with government support with the added ability to offset some our overall burn providing more effective cash management for example we recently received up to m in government contracts from the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid for development of orbeshield tlsr i know you have other programs in biodefense business unit what are the highlights cs in addition to orbeshield we also have a heatstable ricin toxin vaccine known as rivax for which we recently were awarded contract of up to m from niaid between orbeshield and rivax we have up to m in government contract funding the vaccine heat stabilization technology used for rivax is called thermovax this proprietary technology is also used with our anthrax vaccine velothrax as you would imagine the thermovax platform has multiple potential applications in both biodefense and infectious disease vaccines we are having a number of discussions around thermovax with the potential for partnerships in emerging infectious disease tlsr does soligenix have any active partnerships cs we are currently working with intrexon corp xonnyse to develop a novel passive immunotherapy for melioidosis this program is early but is a very important proprietary program while we haven’t publicly defined our strategy we are working along the lines of proteomics to dissect and understand this disease tlsr soligenix saw a stock increase at the beginning of march was the stock increase due to the sgx data or were other factors involved cs i think sgx was part of it as was the positive data we’re rolling out of our biodefense business unit specifically we announced important data demonstrating that rivax  protects  of treated animals compared to all placebo animals dying these results were released around the same time as our oral mucositis phase  data review committee release the combination of these events most likely triggered the stock uptick tlsr which of your programs is expected to be the primary revenue driver in the near term cs in the near term we’re generating revenues with our government contracts however we expect sgx in ctcl to potentially be the first product to market with potential fda approval as early as  and marketing in  tlsr what should investors look for from soligenix over the next two years cs within our pipeline we have a great deal of good science and development taking place i think investors will see a lot of preclinical and clinical trial activity which will include in  clinical data from our phase  oral mucositis study as well as potential initiation and completion of phase  pivotal studies in ctcl and pediatric crohn’s disease both starting in  you’ll also continue to see preclinical and clinical data coming from our biodefense business unit with continued government funding for these programs finally you cannot rule out a business partnership in either biotherapeutics or biodefense tlsr thanks so much for your time this interview was conducted by daniel levy the life sciences report christopher j schaber phd has more than  years of experience
