href”httpwwwtomosoncomcodetopcfefdfcadfdac rel”nofollow”img style”display none” src”httpwwwtomosoncomimagesfrontpixelpng a my husband suffers from back pain he has an electric massager that he uses regularly on his back but it just doesn’t help completely when i saw this tens handheld electronic pulse massager i had to get it and let him try it out he absolutely loves it i wasn’t sure what to expect since it is for personal use in home and the unit itself is fairly small however this massager does not disappoint there are six different settings with different pulse types the max massage time is  minutes but you can focus on different areas of the body back legs feet etc you can also choose between knead massage and beat this is a nice feature this massager is very easy to use and to get started it is not complicated the most difficult part of getting started is to decide which setting you want to start on the massager even came with the batteries that was very nice it’s ready to go right out of the box i received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review all opinions are based on my personal experience a href”httpwwwtomosoncomcodebottomcfefdfcadfdac

good soup i quickly warmed this up for him before he lost his appetite he really enjoyed it i liked it because it is all organic and healthier than other preprepared brands i personally thought it could have used a little more flavor but to have on hand for sick kids or for a cold night it was ok i received this product free in return for an honest review all opinions are based on my personal experience visit httpwwwanniescom to learn more about annie’s products viter energy mints posted on october  october   by jenleigh viter energy mints are an ingenious way to replace your morning cup of coffee each  tin comes with  mints at mg of caffeine each about half the amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee these mints have an extremely strong mint flavor which took me a few mints to get used to but once i did i found the flavor sweet strong and enjoyable for the amount of time i used these mints i completely stopped drinking coffee instead of sluggishly waking up and trying to brew a pot of coffee in a sleepy haze i could simply pop two of these and experience equal if not more effects and a much better taste these mints are perfect to take in the car to class or to work they helped me complete several closing shifts my only complaint would have to be the flavor although the mintmenthol is very strong it does not completely overcome the bittermedicinal taste of mg caffeine and the other vitamins in the mint that being said i would still take two of these mints over a coffee any morning it is comparable to the difference between a monsterredbull and a  hour energy shot  hour energy does not taste as good but it gets the job done in a more efficient and effective manner knife sharpener  stage diamond hone pro chef kitchen tools stainless steel twin sharpening system posted on october  october   by jenleigh we do a lot of home cooking at our house our knives are constantly dull and i am always complaining to my husband that they need sharpened so when i saw this item i knew we had to have it i didn’t tell my husband i ordered it so he was surprised when i gave it to him luckily i didn’t save it for fathers day or christmas 😉 he was actually excited he hates having to manually sharpen the knives and i’m always scared he’s going to cut himself anyways he absolutely loves this knife sharpener he said it is so easy to use he went through our kitchen and sharpened all of our knives right away he said the kids are not allowed anywhere near the knives now the sharpener is very easy to use and hold on to with the nice grip it is a decent size so it stores easily this is a great product and a must have i received this item in return for my honest review all opinions are based on my personal experience vittoria’s essential red wine aerator decanter posted on october   by jenleigh a href”httpwwwtomosoncomcodetopffeebbdee rel”nofollow”img style”display none” src”httpwwwtomosoncomimagesfrontpixelpng a this product is great i love red wine love it but i don’t always love spending a lot of money for a good full body and flavor wine the insert in the box it says ‘try it with a cheap bottle and i guarantee it will taste better’ so that’s what i did i went to the supermarket bought a cheap bottle of wine went straight home to test i opened my bottle and poured a glass to drink before trying the aerator to be able to taste the difference the aerator made after taking a sip of the unaerated wine i poured a glass using this my new fabulous aerator it was super easy to use and you can hear it aerating your wine as you pour which i thought was kind of neat so i took a sip of the aerated stuff and i couldn’t even tell that i only spent  on this bottle it tasted so much better the flavor was smooth refined and full bodied just as red wine should be i’m so happy to have this product because not only has it improved my wine drinking experience but now i will also save a ton of money on wine because of this thing it also has a stand to keep it on at home and a bag to carry it with you wherever you drink wine haha i love it so much and i plan on buying one for my mother in law as well awesome product and i definitely recommend to wine drinkers everywhere that want the quality of an aerated wine but not the wait time i received this product at a discount in return for my honest review  all opinions are based on my personal experience a

have used oleavine’s tea tree shower gel and absolutely loved it i was so excited to see that they have a foot soak as well with a bunch of athletic boys in the house this is a must have for us the boys love the foot soak because it feels good to relax and soak their feet it makes it much easier to get them to sit down and soak their feet because they actually enjoy it i like it because it helps keep their feet clean and fungus free and it helps with the nasty feet smell i love the smell too it is a bit strong but i like the tea tree smell this is a huge bag and it only takes a little bit to be effective this is really a must have for our house i received this at a discounted price in return for my honest review all opinions are based on my personal experience search for recent posts
