functionality product quality customer support na ive been testing the latest version  and it is really good it has new features to create dashboards in an easy and quickly way more similar to what the market for self service bi is requiring pros good design easy to use development is really fast letting you select the data and object that you want to visualize and therefore just create a dashboard within seconds cons the best is to have a well designed data model first or a data warehouse to pull the data and just do some of the latest transformation with the tool that way you can get the most of it advice to others definetiley a good competitor in this sector i like the responsive design mobility and ease of use they have enhanced in this versions i tested     mario from achievers specialty human resources december  december  microstrategy  is outstanding easeofuse functionality product quality customer support likes best the technology is great even though this is one of the legacy bi vendors their technology has kept up with the newer vendors likes least the support has been slow for the past year or so recommendations if money is not an issue microstrategy should be seriously considered the features it offers are among the most complete if simple reporting is needed microstrategy may be too expensive the problem is reporting usually gets more sophisticated as time goes by and sometimes its hard to predict how complex it will get from the beginning if your company needs for instance language support some of the new tools like birst need you to manuallly do translations by duplicating projects if you are also concerned about a centralized approach and reliable security performance and scalability microstrategy is the way to go     jenni from hpm specialty healthcare  social services december  december  very highend easeofuse functionality product quality customer support likes best this software is loaded with featuresfunctionality i dont think ive run into anything that it just cant do their training and user forums are also extremely helpful likes least very steep learning curve for administrationdevelopment and requires very knowledgeable support staff to get and keep it going i think that is to be expected with such a complex product however for a smaller company it can present challenges recommendations it seems like it is great for either very small organizations that want to maybe just use some of the basic functionalitycloud version or large organizations with a team that can be welltrained and dedicated to

for north american small businesses all products in the quadrant are top performers small businesses can use frontrunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them to create this quadrant we evaluated over  bi products those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant scores are based largely on reviews from real software users along with other product performance details eg what features they offer how many customers they have is one quadrant better than the others nope products in any quadrant may fit your needs every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability how much the products can do and value whether they’re worth their cost that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success moreover we’ve homed in on products that offer the right set of capabilities for this market frontrunners has four subquadrants upper right  leaders leaders are allaround strong products they offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers these products are considered highly valuable by customers   upper left  masters masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than leaders do if you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles then a product in the masters quadrant might be right for you   lower right  pacesetters pacesetters may offer a strong set of features but are not rated as highly on value for example a pacesetter might offer greater functionality but cost more   lower left  contenders contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point this makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs depending on the specific needs of a software buyer a product in any of these subquadrants could be a good fit why to even be considered for this frontrunners a product had to achieve a minimum user rating score of  for capability and  for value this means that all products that qualify as frontrunners are topperforming products in their market their positions in the quadrant are plotted relative to how their peers performed for some buyers a specific frontrunners quadrant might be best for example products in the “leaders” quadrant have very high ratings for both product capabilities and value provided to users however these products may use licensing schemes that are more expensive for small businesses than dashboardfocused vendors in the “contenders” and “pacesetters” quadrants even though contenders and pacesetters such as domo and birst offer comparable functionality you can download the full frontrunners for bi report here it contains individual scorecards for each product on the frontrunners quadrant how are frontrunners products selected products are scored based on user reviews and other data you can find the full frontrunners methodology here but the gist is that products are scored in two areas capability and value to be considered at all products must have at least  reviews and achieve minimum user rating scores they also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example selfservice visual analytics and custom dashboards from there user reviews and other product performance details such as the products customer base and the features it offers dictate the capability and value scores capability is plotted on the xaxis and value is plotted on the yaxis got it but what if i have more questions check out our additional resources for more information about

tools buyers guide by justin guinn market research associate last updated july   business intelligence bi software has gained considerable traction since its introduction as decision support systems in the s today there are over  bi software companies selling some type of business intelligence tool we put together this buyers guide to help buyers understand the market in this guide well review what is bi softwareselecting the right bi tooltop business intelligence toolsdata management toolsdata discovery applicationsreporting toolswhat type of buyer are youmarket trends to understandrecent events you should know about what is business intelligence software bi software helps organizations organize and analyze data to make better decisions this could include internal data from company departments as well as from external sources such as marketing data services social media channels or even macroeconomic information the bi market is growing rapidly because of the proliferation of data to analyze over the past few decades companies that have deployed enterprise resource planning erp customer relationship management crm and other applications are now sitting on a mountain of data that can be analyzed in addition the growth of the web has increased the demand for tools that can analyze large data sets one of the biggest trends in the bi market is the shift in software architecture and design to more userfriendly applications these applications are now being used by business users—not just it staff—to analyze particular sets of departmental data including marketing procurement retail and web data common features of business intelligence software bi software can be divided into three broad application categories data management tools data discovery applications and reporting tools including dashboards and visualization software in the next section well explain how these applications can help your organizations decisionmaking process become more datadriven what bi tools you need depends on how your data is currently managed and how you would like to analyze it for example if it is currently scattered across disparate transactional databases you might need to build a data warehouse to centralize it and invest in data management tools that offer extract transform and load etl functionality to move and restructure it once data is given a common structure and format you can invest in data discovery solutions such as online analytical processing olap data mining and semantic or text mining applications with the capability to create custom ad hoc reports and because information is stored within the warehouse users can quickly pull reports without impacting the performance of the organization’s software applications such as crm erp and supply chain management solutions we’ve illustrated this concept in the image below but this isn’t the only way to implement bi within your organization if you’re only analyzing data from a single source etl and data warehouses are unnecessary alternatively you might require multiple warehouses and thus require different tools to connect data between both these servers and other bi applications that need access to this data well cover these in detail in the next section but in general the features you should seek in a new bi solution should include data quality management extract transform and load etl data mining online analytical processing olap predictive analytics semantic and text analytics visualizations dashboards report writers scorecarding top business intelligence tools this

management tools better decisionmaking starts with better data data management tools help clean up dirty data organize information by providing format and structure and prepare databases for analyses functionality description data quality management helps organizations maintain clean standardized and errorfree data standardization is especially important for bi implementations that integrate data from diverse sources data quality management ensures that later analyses are correct and can lead to improvements within the business extract transform and load etl collects data from outside sources transforms it and then loads it into the target system a database or warehouse because primary data is often organized using different schemas or formats analysts can use etl tools to normalize it for useful analysis data discovery applications the ability to sift through data and come to meaningful conclusions is one of the most powerful benefits of adopting business intelligence tools data discovery applications help users make sense of their data whether it be through quick multivariate analysis during olap or via advanced algorithms and statistical computations during data mining functionality description data mining sorts through large amounts of data to identify new or unknown patterns it is often the first step that other processes rely on such as predictive analytics databases are often too large or convoluted to find patterns with the naked eye or through simple queries data mining helps point users in the right direction for further analysis by providing an automated method of discovering previously neglected trends online analytical processing olap enables users to quickly analyze multidimensional data from different perspectives it is typically made up of three analytical operations data consolidation data sorting and classification drilldown and analysis of data from a particular perspective sliceanddice for example a user could analyze sales numbers for various products by store and by month olap allows users to produce this analysis predictive analytics analyzes current and historical data to make predictions about future risks and opportunities an example of this is credit scoring which relies on an individuals current financial standing to make predictions about their future credit behavior semantic and text analytics extracts and interprets large volumes of text to identify patterns relationships and sentiment for example the popularity of social media has made text analytics valuable to companies with a large social footprint understanding semantic trends is a powerful tool for organizations evaluating purchase intent or customer satisfaction among users of these channels reporting tools in the words of john w tuckey “the greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see” reporting applications are an important way to present data and easily convey the results of analysis bi users are increasingly business users—not it staff—who need quick easytounderstand displays of information in response software vendors have been working to mask the complexity of these applications and increasingly focus on the user experience functionality description visualizations helps users create advanced graphical representations of data via simple user interfaces the ability to visualize information in a graphical format as opposed to words or numbers can help users understand data in a more insightful way in addition new interactive tools can provide teams the ability to both analyze and manipulate reports in realtime dashboards dashboards typically highlight key performance indicators kpis which help managers focus on the metrics that are most important to them dashboards are often browserbased making them easily accessible by anyone with permissions report writers allows users to design and generate custom reports many crm and erp systems include builtin report writing tools but users can also purchase standalone applications such as crystal reports to create ad hoc reports based on complex queries this is especially helpful for organizations that continually modify analyses and need to generate new reports quickly scorecarding scorecards attach a numerical weight to performance and map progress toward goals think of it as dashboards taken one step further in organizations with a strategic performancemanagement methodology eg balanced scorecard six sigma etc scorecards are an effective way to keep tabs on key metrics for example a scorecard might establish a grade of “a to  percent yearoveryear growth if the goal was set at  percent what type of buyer are you before evaluating software you must determine what type of buyer you are business users and departmental buyers these buyers favor small datadiscovery vendors and bi tools over the big traditional bi systems easeofuse and fast deployment are more important than indepth functionality and integration they are usually business users rather than it staff it buyers traditional buyers are more focused on functionality and integration within their information infrastructure stacks or other erp applications integration across different entities and departments is usually more important than ease of use market trends to understand as you begin your software comparison and evaluation there are a couple trends to consider inmemory processing olap systems of the past would precalculate every possible combination of data these calculations would be stored in the “cube” and users could retrieve them when they needed a certain analysis creating these cubes was very timeconsuming—sometimes taking as long as a year—and required expertise today computer processors and memory are faster cheaper and more powerful overall this same process can happen inmemory rather than using a diskbased approach with cubes analytic software built on an inmemory architecture can retrieve data and perform calculations in realtime or onthefly big data the internet is rapidly creating vast amounts of data this phenomenon is being dubbed “big data” among it and business leaders business analytics software companies are beefing up their data warehousing and analytics capabilities to keep up with demand however according to gartner through   of fortune  organizations will be unable to exploit big data for competitive advantage the right bi tools can help harness the power of so much data companies dealing with large amounts of data may also want to consider investing in dedicated it security suites to support their computer security needs business users to outnumber it staff this is a major trend playing out in the market more business users—rather than traditional it staff—are evaluating and purchasing software so usability is becoming more important than functionality during software evaluations as a result small data discovery vendors that develop really good interactive visualization tools are gaining market share meanwhile traditional bi vendors are parroting new market entrants by promoting ease of use softwareasaservice saas a growing number of organizations are considering saas or “cloud” bi software instead of traditional onpremise software that you install onlocation cost is a major driver of this trend the poorly performing economy is motivating companies to look at lowercost bi software from saas and open source vendors of course perceived ease of use faster implementations and reduced it needs are also driving this trend onpremise bi vendors are responding by committing development resources to cloud technology mobile bi applications proliferation of the iphone ipad and other mobile devices is pushing vendors eg microsoft and oracle to develop onthego business intelligence applications analysts think mobile bi could expand the population of bi users to a larger mainstream audience recent

settlement offer that the commission has determined to accept solely for the purposes of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the commission or to which the commission is a party and without admitting or denying the findings contained herein except as to jurisdiction over it and over the subject matter of these proceedings which microstrategy admits microstrategy consents to the entry of this order instituting proceedings pursuant to section c of the securities exchange act of  making findings remedial sanctions and imposing a ceaseanddesist order order the commission has determined that it is appropriate to accept the offer of microstrategy and accordingly is issuing this order iii facts based on the foregoing the commission finds that a respondent microstrategy inc is a delaware corporation with principal offices in vienna virginia from its ipo on june   to the present microstrategys common stock was registered pursuant to section g of the exchange act  usc § lg and was quoted on the nasdaq national market system b summary from the time of its initial public offering in june  through march  microstrategy inc a software company whose securities are listed on nasdaq materially overstated its revenues and earnings contrary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap the companys public financial reports during this time showed a growing software and information services company enjoying positive net income in fact as investors later learned microstrategy should have reported net losses from  through the present the companys restatement reduced revenues over the threeyear period by approximately  million of the  million reported approximately  million or  of these restated revenues were in  the companys reporting failures primarily derived from its premature recognition of revenue arising from the misapplication of aicpa statement of position  in connection with multiple element deals in which significant services or future products to be provided by microstrategy were not separable from the upfront sale of a license to microstrategys existing software products additional restatements resulted from deals in which microstrategy had not properly executed contracts in the same fiscal period that revenue was recorded from those deals as well as other accounting errors the incorrect financial results were reported in various periodic reports filed with the commission and disseminated to the investing public from the fourth quarter of  through yearend  and in registration statements filed in connection with a june  initial public offering and a pending public offering filed in february  that was subsequently withdrawn on march   microstrategy announced that it intended to restate its financial results for the fiscal years  and  microstrategy stock which had recently reached a high of  per share dropped over  of its value in one day dropping from  per share to close at  per share on march   the stock price continued to drop in the following weeks by april   after microstrategy announced that it would also restate its fiscal  financial results the companys stock closed at  per share c microstrategys background microstrategy was incorporated in delaware in november  the companys primary business in the early years consisted of providing software consulting services to help customers build custom software systems to access analyze and use information contained in largescale transactionlevel databases during  and  microstrategy began focusing its efforts on the development and sale of datamining and decision support software and related products by  a majority of microstrategys revenues resulted from software license sales the company licensed its software through its direct sales force and through value added resellers var and original equipment manufacturers oem by  sales through vars and oems sometimes known as channel partners accounted for more than  of microstrategys total revenues since  microstrategys revenues have been derived primarily from three sources i product licenses ii fees for maintenance technical support and training and iii consulting and development services shortly after going public in june  microstrategy began in the third quarter  to engage in a series of increasingly larger and more complex transactions involving the sale of software as well as extensive software application development and consulting services by late  microstrategy began developing an information network  initially known as telepath now known as strategycom  supported by the microstrategy software platform the network as conceived would deliver personalized finance news weather traffic travel and entertainment information to individuals through cell phones fax machines emails etc for a fee an entity could become a strategycom affiliate and offer the strategycom channels and services on a cobranded basis directly to their customers and in turn share with microstrategy a percentage of the subscription revenues from endusers during the relevant time period strategycom affiliate deals ranged from the relatively simple purchase of the right to offer customers access to the strategycom channels for a flat fee to much more complex transactions involving in addition to an affiliation with microstrategy a large scale commitment of consulting and development services to build custom information delivery systems d accounting for software sales generally accepted accounting principles require that revenue from the sale of software be recognized consistent with statement of position  sop  contains specific guidance on whether a company may recognize revenue from a software license sale at the time of the sale or whether the sale must be recognized consistent with contract accounting principles if an arrangement to deliver software or a software system does not require significant production modification or customization sop  specifies that the following four criteria must be met prior to recognizing revenue for a singleelement arrangement or for amounts allocated to individual elements of a multipleelement arrangement i persuasive evidence of an arrangement ii delivery has occurred iii vendors fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable sop  further requires that if the software being licensed requires significant production modification or customization or any of the above four criteria are not present the company may not recognize revenue from the software or software system at the time of the transaction but instead must apply contract accounting where the software transaction contains multipleelements ie software upgradesenhancements andor consulting services sop  provides guidance concerning when the software license component may be considered a separate element and thus permit the company to recognize some revenue at the time of the transaction sop  provides that when an arrangement contains multipleelements the company must also assess whether the services being sold as part of the arrangement are considered by the customer to be integral to the functionality of the software product license component if the company determines that the service component of the arrangement is integral to the functionality of the software license component the company must apply contract accounting microstrategys form k and annual report for the fiscal yearend december   and subsequent public filings all stated that subsequent to december   the company began recognizing revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition in addition microstrategys internal revenue recognition policy in effect during the relevant time period stated that the company recognized revenue in accordance with sop  microstrategy however had not complied with sop  instead recognizing revenue earlier than allowed under gaap e accounting errors contract signing by microstrategy as is common in the software industry the majority of microstrategys transactions closed in the final days of the fiscal period as a result at the end of a quarter microstrategys contracts department received numerous contracts signed by customers that needed according to company policy to be signed by microstrategy to maintain maximum flexibility to achieve the desired quarterly financial results microstrategy held until after the close of the quarter contracts that had been signed by customers but had not yet been signed by microstrategy only after microstrategy determined the desired financial results were the unsigned contracts apportioned between the justended quarter and the thencurrent quarter signed and given an effective date in some instances the contracts were signed without affixing a date allowing the company further flexibility to assign a date at a later time gaap and microstrategys own accounting policies required the signature of both microstrategy and the customer prior to recognizing revenue other contracts not signed by quarter close in at least three instances microstrategy recognized revenue on transactions that were not completed or signed by either party prior to the close of the quarter on december   microstrategy was engaged in final negotiations with primark corporation a massachusetts based financial economic and market research information company sometime prior to midnight negotiations broke down over an issue that was not resolved until the following week although neither the primark representative nor microstrategy signed the final contract until the week of january    million was recognized by microstrategy in its quarter ended december   as discussed below the primark transaction was ultimately restated due to a misapplication of the multipleelement transaction requirements of sop  revenue improperly recognized from this contract was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the quarter similarly on september   the last day of microstrategys  third quarter negotiations with ncr corporation over a  million transaction continued past midnight microstrategy signed the final contract sometime in the early hours of october   although the contract had not been signed by the end of the quarter microstrategy recognized  million in revenue from the transaction in the quarter ended september   the ncr transaction was ultimately restated due to a misapplication of sop s provisions regarding the delivery of future products in a multipleelement arrangement revenue improperly recognized from this contract was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the quarter for the quarter ended march   microstrategy recognized  in revenue from a contract with choicepoint inc that had been signed by choicepoint on april   but dated march   revenue improperly recognized from this contract was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the quarter accounting for multiple element transactions after the ipo microstrategys business moved increasingly away from the straightforward sale of software toward multifaceted increasingly complex transactions with extensive service obligations generally for accounting purposes product revenue is recognized immediately while revenue from services is recognized as the services are provided consistent with sop  in a transaction with software and service elements revenue is recognized on the software only if the software sale is separable from the sale of services and only after revenue attributable to the service element is deducted in a number of the restated transactions microstrategy improperly i separated product license sales from service elements and ii characterized revenue in multiple element transactions as product or software revenue and recognized it at the time of the transaction for example in the fourth quarter of  microstrategy negotiated a  million transaction with shopko stores inc to provide software licenses as well as among other things extensive consulting and development services and a warrant permitting shopko to purchase  shares of microstrategy common stock the services were in part to develop software applications for the microstrategy software platform the overwhelming majority of the software licenses purchased by shopko were to be used in conjunction with the tobedeveloped applications although the product and the service elements were interdependent microstrategy accounted for the software product element as though it were separate from the service and warrant obligations in addition microstrategy recognized the entire  million received in the transaction as software product license revenue allocating no revenue to the extensive service obligations or the warrant the  million in revenue improperly recognized was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the quarter in the fourth quarter of  micrstrategy negotiated a multiple element transaction with exchange applications inc which included among other things software and extensive consulting and development service elements the focus of the transaction was the development of customer relationship management software and applications leveraging existing microstrategy and exchange applications software technology exchange applications agreed to pay microstrategy  million dollars for the i right to resell microstrategys product line as a var ii consulting and development services of a dedicated business unit of microstrategy employees and iii intellectual property rights to product developed by the dedicated business unit again microstrategy improperly separated the software product element of the transaction from the service component and as a result recognized  million in the fourth quarter of  the  improperly recognized was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the quarter strategycom transactions the strategycom transactions combine similar service and software elements and thus presented similar revenue recognition issues as those discussed in the preceding section in the fourth quarter of  when the company began to sell the first strategycom affiliations strategycom was in the development stage at the time only a single preliminary version of a finance channel existed for the affiliation fee the affiliate had access to certain microstrategy software for the limited purpose of providing access to the strategycom network this software was not delivered to the affiliate nor did the affiliate have the ability to use the software outside the context of the network microstrategy in essence hosted the network since there was little initially to host or to offer affiliate subscribers many of the early strategycom transactions had a development component  some required that microstrategy develop additional or specialized channels others required the development of customized applications for the channels these often involved additional software licenses and services microstrategy improperly recognized revenue up front on certain strategycom transactions by improperly characterizing transactions as the sale of software product for example in the second quarter of  microstrategy recognized  million in product revenue from a strategycom transaction with ameritrade holding corporation as part of the arrangement microstrategy agreed to develop customized systems for ameritrade to provide certain channels to its customers ameritrade also purchased from microstrategy the software product licenses necessary in order to eventually provide its customers with access to the tobedeveloped applications since the service element of the transaction was not separable from the software element microstrategy should have recognized revenue over the term of the contract instead microstrategy characterized the entire  million received from ameritrade at the time of the transaction as software product license and recognized it at the time of the transaction the  million in revenue improperly recognized was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the quarter the same issue arises in several other strategycom deals including metrocall inc in the fourth quarter of  and primark in the fourth quarter of  in each of these transactions microstrategy was obligated to provide services related to the development or delivery of channels in both cases microstrategy improperly recognized the full contract revenue  million for metrocall  million for primark as product revenue rather than recognizing the revenue over the term of the agreement other accounting issues microstrategys financial statements suffered from other revenue recognition problems for example microstrategys agreement with ncr included a license to all current and future generally available software products in microstrategys product line because a company cannot provide vendor specific objective evidence of the fair market value for unspecified future products sop  requires the application of contract accounting to arrangements containing unspecified future product obligations the  million in revenue improperly recognized from this transaction was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the third quarter of  in the third quarter of  microstrategy recognized  million of revenue from a transaction with sybase inc in which the two companies essentially swapped  million of software consistent with gaap this transaction should have been accounted for as a barter transaction and would have resulted in no revenue being recognized until such time as the software was used by microstrategy internally or was sold to another party the  million in revenue improperly recognized was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the quarter in the first quarter of  microstrategy entered into an arrangement with kmart corporation to provide software licenses maintenance and services in connection with the transaction the sales staff issued a side letter to kmart promising the delivery of future product at no cost microstrategy improperly recognized approximately  million in revenue that quarter the revenue was later deferred since the value of the future product could not be determined and the product had yet to be delivered the  million in revenue improperly recognized was material to microstrategys reported financial results for the quarter f microstrategys share price microstrategys june   ipo was priced at  per share adjusting for a january   for  stock split and on the first day of trading the shares rose approximately  during january  microstrategy shares traded in a range between  and  per share the shares continued to trade in this range through september  during the first week of october  microstrategy shares rose to between  and  per share and by middecember the shares traded for more than  per share microstrategy shares continued to rise eventually reaching  per share on march   g microstrategys reported financial results and restatement on march   microstrategy announced that it would restate its reported financial results for the fiscal years  and  microstrategy thereafter restated its reported financial results for the fiscal years   and  as follows   revenuein thousands net income reporting period original restated original restated year ended   december       quarter ended   march       june       september       december       year ended   december       quarter ended   march       june       september       december       year ended   december       iv legal discussion a microstrategy violated the reporting provisions of the exchange act section a of the exchange act requires issuers to file such annual and quarterly reports as the commission may prescribe and in conformity with such rules as the commission may promulgate rules a and a require the filing of annual and quarterly reports that comply with the commissions regulation sx which requires that financial statements be presented in conformity with gaap as described above the periodic reports and registration statements filed by microstrategy between june  and january  were not in conformity with gaap consequently microstrategy violated section a of the exchange act and rules a and a thereunder b microstrategy violated the recordkeeping and internal controls provisions of the exchange act section ba of the exchange act requires public companies such as microstrategy to make and keep books and records which accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of assets as discussed above microstrategy failed to keep accurate books and records reflecting among other things the quarter in which revenue was recognized and the amount of recognizable revenue microstrategy violated section ba of the exchange act section bb of the exchange act requires microstrategy to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that among other things transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and to maintain accountability of assets as described above microstrategys internal accounting controls were inadequate specifically microstrategy routinely affixed earlier dates to contracts signed after the close of a quarter and had inadequate procedures to ensure appropriate revenue recognition in conformity with gaap thus microstrategy violated section bb of the exchange act v the commission finds that microstrategy violated sections a ba and bb of the exchange act and rules a and a thereunder vi accordingly it is hereby ordered pursuant to section c of the exchange act that microstrategy cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of sections a ba and bb of the exchange act and rules
