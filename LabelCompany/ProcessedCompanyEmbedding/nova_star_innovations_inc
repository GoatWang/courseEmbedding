condensed financial statements   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the company without audit in the opinion of management all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position results of operations and cash flows as of and for the period ended september   and for all periods presented have been made   certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america have been condensed or omitted it is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the company’s december   audited financial statements as reported in its form k the results of operations for the period ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ended december     note  – going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company has limited assets has incurred losses since inception has negative cash flows from operations and has no revenuegenerating activities its activities have been limited for the past several years and it is dependent upon financing to continue operations these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty it is management’s plan to acquire or merge with other operating companies   note   recent pronouncement   on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued update asu  development stage entities topic  amongst other things the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from topic  thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information on the statements of income cash flows and shareholders’ equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim reporting periods beginning after december   however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued the company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inceptiontodate information on the respective financial statements   note  – subsequent events   the company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no such events that would have a material impact on the financial statements              table of contents     in this report references to “nova star” “the company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to nova star innovations inc   forward looking statements   the u s securities and exchange commission “sec” encourages reporting companies to disclose forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed investment decisions this report contains these types of statements words such as “may” “expect” “believe” “intend” “anticipate” “estimate” “project” or “continue” or comparable terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forwardlooking statements you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this report all forwardlooking statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forwardlooking statements            table of contents     item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   executive overview   we have not recorded revenues and are dependent upon financing to continue basic operations management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management significant stockholders or third parties to meet our cash requirements but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing funds and therefore no one is obligated to provide funds to us in the future these factors raise doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern our plan is to combine with an operating company to generate revenue   as of the date of this report our management has not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks any business combination or transaction may likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to present stockholders of the company   we anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of securities potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex   if we obtain a business opportunity then it may be necessary to raise additional capital we anticipate that we will sell our common stock to raise this additional capital we expect that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws the purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the securities act of  we do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock we also note that if we issue more shares of our common stock then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common stock   liquidity and capital resources   we have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs we have relied primarily upon related parties to pay for our operating expenses at september   our cash increased to  as compared to  at december   and our total liabilities increased to  at september   as compared to  at december   the increase in total liabilities primarily represents accounts payable of  for professional services performed by or paid for by a stockholder along with loans of  and accrued interest of  incurred during the nine month period ended september     we intend to obtain capital from management significant stockholders andor third parties to cover minimal operations however there is no assurance that additional funding will be available our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such company the type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for the long term   during the next  months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of exchange act reports we believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management significant stockholders andor third parties we may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses            table of contents     results of operations   we did not record revenues in either  or  general and administrative expense decreased to  for the  nine month period compared to  for the  nine month period general and administrative expense decreased to  for the  third quarter compared to  for the  third quarter the decrease in general and administrative expense in the  nine month period primarily reflects reduced costs related to professional consulting services and other expenses paid on our behalf   total other expense increased to  for the  nine month period compared to  for the  nine month period total other expense increased to  for the  third quarter compared to  for the  third quarter the increase for the interim periods was attributable to accrued interest on notes payable   our net loss decreased to  for the  nine month period compared to  for the  nine month period our net loss increased to  for the  third quarter compared to  for the  third quarter management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity   commitments and obligations   at september   we recorded notes payable totaling  representing services received as well as cash advances received from related and third parties all of the notes payable are noncollateralized carry interest at  and are due on demand total accrued interest as of september   on all notes payable was    at september   two lenders represent in excess of  of the company’s accounts payable and notes payable   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have not entered into any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors   critical accounting policies   we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jumpstart our business startups act of  the “jobs act” as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company among other things we will not be required to       · have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act         · submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency”         · obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and         · disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation              table of contents     in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed third fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding threeyear period   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable to smaller reporting companies   item  controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae or de under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec this information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure our president who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency during the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information due to the size and operations of the company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company   changes to internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the exchange act management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended september   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting              table of contents     part ii – other
