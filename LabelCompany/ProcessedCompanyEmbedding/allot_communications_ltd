detection home technology network anomaly detection when it comes to detecting ddos and botnet traffic you need to get it right right away your security appliances are constantly on the lookout for traffic irregularities that could spell trouble when monitoring networks for traffic anomalies you need to be able to distinguish between malicious flooding and legitimate traffic spikes otherwise you run the risk of overblocking and angering your users and when a bona fide attack is detected it has to be neutralized right away without blocking or limiting legitimate traffic flows that are sharing the same network resource often behind a nat ip allot’s advanced anomaly detection technologies – network behavior anomaly detection nbad and host behavior anomaly detection hbad – do both these patented technologies power allot ddos protection and bot containment solutions which are deployed in service provider and enterprise networks worldwide where they provide a first line of defense against cyber threats network behavior anomaly detection nbad allot’s patented nbad technology identifies ddos and other network flooding events by the anomalies they cause in the normally timeinvariant behavior of “network ratios” ie combinations of layer  and  packet rate statistics packet filtering rules are obtained dynamically by searching deep into the captured ddos packets for unique repeating patterns in each event surgical filtering accuracy is often achieved using the patterns detected in the layer  and  headers and layer  payload allot accurately detects network traffic anomalies caused by high packet rate small packet size or large packet size fanin many ips to one ip typical of ddos attacks fanout one ip to many ips dos one ip to one ip tcpbased incidents syn fin ack rst invalid flag combinations udpbased incidents icmp including echo request echo reply unreachable other incidents nontcp udp or icmp incidents involving fragmented truncated or malformed packets various amplification attacks allot nbad technology detects network traffic anomalies and creates attack pattern signatures in  seconds notifies you of the attack via email syslog and snmp trap vc and immediately begins surgical mitigation the inline deployment of allot ddos protection solutions means that flooding attacks are stopped on the spot at the edge of your network without having to divert huge volumes of traffic to cloud scrubbing centers host behavior anomaly detection hbad allot’s patented hbad technology detects hosts or endpoints that are generating abnormal levels of outbound connection activity such as outbound spam as well as host traffic that exhibits malicious connection patterns matching malware infection or abusive behavior allot accurately detects host traffic anomalies caused by address scan port scan flow bomb bombarding the same target ip and port with a high number of flows mass smtp address scanning or flow bombs to tcp mass dns address scanning or flow bombs to udp mass icmp including echo request echo reply unreachable allot hbad technology detects anomalous host traffic in  minutes sending notification that allows you to surgically block or limit the outbound traffic only anomalous traffic is blocked even when the source of an attack is behind a nat ip when allot’s dpi is deployed on the private ip space allot’s solution can also redirect the infected host to a captive portal for cleanup enabling you to treat the problem at the source instead of just the symptom read how our nbad and hbad technologies embedded in allot’s
