the world   we’re passionate about people power potable water and the environment       baseload electric power and clean water are the “great equalizers” they are the foundations upon which societies are built sufficient power and clean water are national security issues both for those countries with an abundant supply and those without if a community does not have access to adequate power and clean water it cannot advance sufficiently to become independent from subsidies provided by more developed communities and countries that may have dubious political reasons for supporting developing countries this puts stress on the global economy clean water and baseload power comprise the most basic health infrastructure according to the united nations environment programme unep over  million deaths each year are attributed to diarrhea caused by dirty water additionally  million children under the age of five succumb to waterborne diseases equating to an infant dying every  seconds from dirty water power and water are inextricably linked the production of power requires water while the treatment and distribution of water is equally dependent upon available and affordable power the basic essentials of water and power also allow a community to create a more advanced infrastructure that will foster improved education trade and commerce industry communications and ultimately a stable political system in turn these assets promote a society that values its own culture as well as the diversity in the world around them developed nations are and should be incentivized to help those less fortunate establish these essential assets for national and global security reasons ix power pronounced nine power recognizes that establishing an appropriate type of energy to power conversion is not an easy task ix power has the expertise tools and experience to make these kinds of tasks easier and much more cost effective than traditional approaches we recognize the positive impact and opportunities provided to communities when they have clean safe water and clean safe power it’s surprising to many just how much of the planet’s fresh surface water is actually ice and snow if the earth is warming what effect will the melting of all this frozen water have on the dry land and the populations residing in coastal areas     ix power was formed to help communities obtain both of these key assets ix power provides technologyneutral analysis to determine which types of power production best meet a community’s need we then bring appropriate global partners together to create

water into the environment each year produced water is highly saline and contaminated with a complex mixture of salts volatile and semivolatile organics metals organic acids and particulates as well as additives from the drilling process og companies pay to have this contaminated water cleaned or trucked to reinjection sites for disposal—an expensive and timeconsuming process that can represent as much as  of the total cost of hydrocarbon production produced water accounts for  of the waste stream from oil  gas recovery  ix power clean water is manufacturing a new system to eliminate organic hydrocarbons in produced water this system called organiclear was developed at los alamos national laboratory lanl the threepart treatment system includes a surfactantmodified zeolite smz vapor phase bioreactor vpb and membrane bioreactor mbr  this treatment system offers og companies and water users a costeffective treatment process to decontaminate produced water for beneficial use in addition to lowering production costs ix power organiclear™ will provide a new water resource for industry and agriculture and a more environmentally friendly solution for disposing of produced water  the smz portion of the treatment system works by adsorbing organic compounds from produced water when saturated with organics the smz is regenerated by air stripping the offgas is directed to the vpb which biologically converts the volatile and semivolitale components particularly btex and npd to innocuous byproducts at up to  removal efficiency the produced water is then pumped through the mbr component which removes organic acids finally the treated produced water can be run through a traditional reverse osmosis ro or other filtering system to remove salts and dissolved solids the result is clean water that can be used for industrial or agricultural purposes or safely reintroduced to a water system  the ix power clean water organiclear produced water treatment system is tolerant of a wide range of chemistries and is fully automated to provide continuous produced water treatment this system may be used to treat produced water with a variety of contaminants contaminant concentrations flow rates and stripping rates making it flexible for use with produced water from nearly any location additional applications for the produced water treatment system include treatment of bilge waters and coproduced waters from other industrial processes such as power generation  organiclear is patented and has been field tested ix power is now taking orders for custom manufacturing

technology eliminates organic hydrocarbons from produced water even better than mother nature keeps system costs low by using commercially available components and onsite recharging of the filter media eliminates expensive removal and reinjection costs associated with current disposal methods creates new source of usable water especially in arid regions   increases ro system lifetime   cleans

oklahoma was hit with the largest earthquake in the state’s history it was felt from north dakota to houston once very geologically active oklahoma is riddled with fault lines that are susceptible to the unstability caused by the reinjection below the water table of “produced water” – wastewater – from oil and gas operations in the region by most accounts there are more than  such wells in the state   “there is no need for earthquakes because there is no longer a need to inject produced water from industry operations” said senator domenici who championed energy innovation during his  years in the senate representing new mexico “the ix water og system was conceptualized built and tested by a team of scientists from los alamos national laboratory new mexico tech and the university of texas and makes it possible to effectively and costefficiently treat produced water for reuse the energy industry can thereby eliminate the reinjection practice while transforming waste into a safe

clean water’s wwwixwatercom treatment technology developed at los alamos national laboratory can eliminate earthquakes in oklahoma texas colorado and other oil producing states by eliminating the need to inject oil and gas wastewater into deep wells   last week oklahoma was hit with the largest earthquake in the state’s history it was felt from north dakota to houston once very geologically active oklahoma is riddled with fault lines that are susceptible to the unstability caused by the reinjection below the water table of “produced water” – wastewater – from oil and gas operations in the region by most accounts there are more than  such wells in the state   “there is no need for earthquakes because there is no longer a need to inject produced water from industry operations” said senator domenici who championed energy innovation during his  years in the senate representing new mexico “the ix water og system was conceptualized built and tested by a team of scientists from los alamos national laboratory new mexico tech and the university of texas and makes it possible to effectively and costefficiently treat produced water for reuse the energy industry can thereby eliminate the reinjection practice while transforming waste into a safe asset for thirsty farms and ranches or recycled for o  g operations”    for more click here   ix power ceo grizz deal interview on og
