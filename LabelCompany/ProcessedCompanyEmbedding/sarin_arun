the world his initial appointment was as vice president of human resources in less than a year he was promoted to senior vice president of corporate strategy and development a position that fit him exceedingly well his responsibilities included working on corporate acquisitions developing partnerships and forming strategic alliances with other companies throughout the industrysarins dedication and commitment to airtouch were demonstrated by the following incident while celebrating his th birthday at a party he received word that a major deal was brewing between corporate competitors that had serious implications for airtouchs future existence despite being the honored guest sarin left the celebration to assess the problem and to try to influence its outcome as a result of his direct

promoted to president and chief operating officer of airtouch a position he held for approximately two yearsin  airtouch and vodafone a large british wireless communications company decided to join forces to create vodafoneairtouch which produced greater financial and human resources and enabled the company to compete more effectively in the international wirelesscommunications marketplace sarin was named chief executive of the newly formed corporate entity responsible for managing operations in the usasia pacific region and for some  employees in order to expand services sarin with his years of experience partnering with other companies created a strategic alliance with infospace an internet infrastructure company based in bellevue washington to deliver wireless internet services to mobile customers who resided in some two dozen countries advisorcom january  sir christopher gent the fairly young ceo of vodafone had always expressed the greatest respect for sarins financial abilities and managerial and leadership skills he understood sarins value to the newly formed company and wanted sarin to continue to his employment sarin wanted to add the position of chief operating officer coo to his corporate resume as a step toward becoming the ceo of vodafone one day but gent decided that there was no pressing need to create the position of coo at the company faced with this decision and the fact that the youthful gent would likely remain ceo for many years sarin concluded that his path to top was blocked and he was unwilling to take a lesser role in the companys hierarchy on april   sarin resigned from vodafoneairtouch and took the ceo position at infospace hedging his bets gent then offered sarin a nonsalaried position as a member of the board of directors at vodafoneairtouch a position that sarin willingly acceptedinfospaces founder ceo and chairman naveen jain by several accounts badgered sarin until he accepted the ceo position at the company said sarin naveen kept coming up and bugging me this is classic naveen he comes at you and at you and at you… im  theres a time in life when you have done what youre going to do its time to take a bigger chance thestreetcom april   despite his easy transition into the ceo position at infospace however sarin expressed concerns about his ability to balance work and family life he was worried that his new position might impact negatively on his family which chose not to move from their home in piedmont california to bellevue washington the headquarters of infospacejain had the utmost respect for sarins abilities in the global telecommunications business and sarin complemented jains knowledge of the internet as ceo sarin had an external role developing partnerships with global companies and an internal role that focused on recruiting and strengthening the management team at infospace sarin led the merger of infospace and gonet a consumerportal company for approximately  billion in a stock swapafter a short eightmonth tenure at infospace sarin resigned citing family obligations which included weekly travel from his home in piedmont to infospace headquarters in bellevue although family matters undoubtedly played a significant role in his decision to leave the company there was talk among industry analysts about discontent at the top jain asked sarin to remain at the company in a nonexecutive capacity as vice chairman of the board of directors a position that he accepted sarin agreed to meet with customers and not to seek employment at another company for  days despite his willingness to stay with infospace as a nonexecutive director several industry analysts raised strong concerns about sarins unexpected early departure from infospace and the future of the company without his leadershipafter leaving infospace in january  sarin spent some time collecting his thoughts despite the fact that he was quite wealthy by now he refused to lead a simple sedentary life outside of corporate life on july   having honored his agreement with infospace sarin joined accel partners and kohlberg kravis roberts kkr to lead a new telecommunications venture called accelkkr telecom as ceo of this new venture sarin was responsible for identifying and working with established companies in the telecommunications industry seeking financial and human capitalupon sarins appointment paul hazen chairman of accelkkr telecom described sarins management and leadership traits his ability to manage operate and achieve real world handson results will be invaluable in attracting significant investment opportunities and distinguish accelkkr from other investment partnerships in the telecom space accelkkr press release july   as with earlier appointments sarins background in finance and his broad experiences in the telecommunication industry made him a natural choice for this new position under his watch as ceo sarin assessed potential global business opportunities and worked on the acquisition of the yellow pages bell canada business in addition he served as a nonexecutive director on several major corporate boards of directors including charles schwab cisco systems the gap and vodafone after approximately  months at accelkkr telecom sarin resigned to become ceo designate his old firm now called vodafone groupunder the leadership of sir

his family on december   lord ian maclaurin the chairman of vodafone called on sarin to rejoin the company his appointment as ceo designate began on april   maclaurin said of sarins appointment i am delighted that arun sarin has made the commitment to take the group forward to the next phase and that we have identified an individual with the ability stature and knowledge of vodafone which make him the ideal person for this role vodafone press release december  sarins appointment drew mixed reviews from telecommunications analysts andrew darley an analyst at ing financial markets raised concerns about vodafones financial picture we would like to see a continuing cash flow from existing operations as opposed to a continuing acquisition strategy sarins finance background undoubtedly gave him the ability to work on maintaining a positive cash flow on the other hand despite his many excellent leadership attributes and his wealth of executive experience in the telecommunications business one analyst questioned his appointment as a replacement for the retiring dealmaker gent damen maltarp a telecommunicationsindustry analyst at bank of america commented i wouldnt class him as the ideal replacement for chris gent… i think a lot of people will be asking who he is other analysts gave sarin high marks as gents successor due to his education and experience his previous experience at vodafone and the seamless leadership succession and transition that his appointment created for the company darley commented that effectively he has been part of the global business strategy this means continuity in strategy and we like the company as it is bbc news december  after several months as ceo designate sarin was installed as the ceo of vodafone on july   after only a
