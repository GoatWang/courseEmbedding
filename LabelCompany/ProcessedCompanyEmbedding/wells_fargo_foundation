marketing your product or service your main selling points should be front and center here are some ideas for showing off your features and benefits published april   tags marketing messages product features benefit statements your marketing should show your customers how each feature of your product solves a problem meets a need or satisfies a desire here are four tips to help you communicate the value of your offerings  identify the features of your product or service look at what you offer and ask how is it made what is it made of how is it packaged and delivered what is new or unique about it does it offer a bonus what is its life span your marketable features might include free consultations the technology you use the contractors you hire overnight delivery or followup services not every feature is worth marketing so consider what will appeal most to customers  showcase features and benefits features are the actual characteristics and capabilities of your product benefits are how these features provide value to your customers for example a digital cameras features might include megapixels lens type and memory card size but its benefit would be the ability to capture action shots without motion blur analyze your offerings to make sure you understand your features and benefits and can leverage both in marketing related learn how to create a unique value proposition  craft benefit statements for each item on your list of product or service features consider the advantage it provides to customers does the feature solve a problem or address a frustration does it satisfy a need or desire then use that information to create benefit statements which list the larger benefit of an offering first and follow up with the specific features heres an example picternity photography captures and preserves your cherished family memories for generations to come we print on archival canvas so your portraits will stand the test of time and become cherished heirlooms  revise your message as needed adapt your benefit statements for different media types including packaging product descriptions advertising messages and inperson meetings for example you should develop a very short version of your pitch for your packaging and mobile website which consumers are likely to just scan consider writing it as bulleted list zapposcom is one online merchant that uses this approach   waterresistant upper for durability cushioned midsole for allday comfort lug sole for stability and traction while this format isnt suitable for all marketing messages it can help you communicate features and benefits to customers quickly and clearly by highlighting the direct benefits that come with the features of your product or service you can show customers why your offerings
