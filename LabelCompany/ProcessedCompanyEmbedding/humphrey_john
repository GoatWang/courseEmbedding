a friend who recently told me at my company we dont hire when it hurts we hire when it kills he even added an expletive before the word kills but i left that outdont hire when it merely hurts but hire when it absolutely kills i think this is right by the way the same goes for hiring software or other technologiesonly when something starts to kill do you intimately know the problem the underlying factors and the effect it is having on your business and your life when you know these things youll make a wiser hiring decision giving you a better return on your moneyif you hire when it merely hurts you put money control and other people at risk because you dont have a full understanding of the problem youre facing just start building april   by john humphrey have an idea that keeps you up at nightjust start building a prototype a collection of research a slide deck a landing page anything have a conversation about it in most cases you can start building with just some time energy and very little money if anywhen you start building youll start hitting roadblocks the roadblocks will get bigger as you go further and the amount of energy youll need to dedicate to get past the roadblocks will also grow when this happens youll learn quickly whether the idea means something to you or notif it means something to you keep going if it doesnt dont worry too much about it you
