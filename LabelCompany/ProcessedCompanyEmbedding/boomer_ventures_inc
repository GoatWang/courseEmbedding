associated with this offering and partially to the development of the search engine we will pay all costs relating to this offering the table below shows the intended net proceeds from this offering we expect to receive for scenarios where we sell various amounts of the shares since we are making this offering without any minimum requirement there is no guarantee that we will be successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus accordingly the actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this offering if any may differ percent of net proceeds received

percentages of amounts of the related offering we plan to use the proceeds for the establishment of our operations and depending on the amount of funds raised for marketing travel and for the development of the proposed search engine as below all amounts listed below are estimates and do not include funds currently available to us amount raised after offering costs         legal and

are successful in raising  of the funds sought we will be able to increase our administrative costs to raise efficiency of our business  we will utilize funds currently in our account to ensure that we will be able to develop the proposed search engine our offering expenses are comprised of legal and accounting expenses and printing costs the minimum amount of accounting and legal expenses we anticipate in the first year following the effective date would be  our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their efforts in selling our shares we intend to use the proceeds of this offering in the manner set forth above in the event that we do not raise the entire amount we seek to raise and are unable to generate revenues to raise that amount then we may cut back on some of the costs such as travel and development costs or we may attempt to raise additional funds via private placements or sales of securities to or loans from our directors in order to make up any shortfall the most immediate use of funds will be the development of the proposed search engine the second critical element would be retention of employees travel legal and accounting will be the first line items to be reduced if the required funding is not raised if we are successful in raising  of the funds sought we will primarily focus on completing the development of the first version of the proposed search engine we believe that the minimum net offering receivables we require to fund our activity for the next twelve months is  coupled with cash on hand that will enable us to develop the proposed search engine if we are not successful in raising sufficient funds to fully develop the proposed search engine we will need to raise funds from our director we do not have any agreements in place with our directors to provide loans to the company if needed we do not intend to use the proceeds to finance the acquisition of other businesses at present no material changes are contemplated should there be any material changes in the projected use of proceeds in connection with this offering we will issue an amended prospectus reflecting the new uses in all instances after the effectiveness of this registration statement the company will need some amount of working capital to maintain its general existence and comply with its public reporting obligations in addition to changing allocations because of the amount of proceeds received we may change the use of proceeds because of required changes in our business plan investors should understand that we will exercise discretion over the use of proceeds to ensure that funds are used to advance the development of the company’s website and or proposed search engine therefore management decisions may not be in line with the initial objectives of investors who will have little ability to influence these decisions boomer’s chief competition comes from the search engine industry which is rapidly growing as a result the number and sophistication of competitors are also rapidly growing we hope to distinguish ourselves from these competitors by the combination of services we offer the high quality of our website and technology and our focus on our core demographic there are numerous travel search websites on the internet such as kayak and hotwire we hope to distinguish ourselves by utilizing a deep search engine to uncover all available travel options that might be overlooked by popular travel search websites the deep web is a world wide web content that is not part of the surface web which is indexed by standard search engines which are considered as our competitors mike bergman founder of brightplanet and credited with coining the phrase said that searching standard search engines on the internet today can be compared to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean a great deal may be caught in the net but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed most of the web’s information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites and standard traditional search engines used by our competitors do not find it standard traditional search engines cannot see or retrieve content in the deep web our company will attempt to design and create a search engine that will search all of the relevant sites to expose the best deals – the closest thing to a onestop experience our search engine will have the ability to crawl the deep web whereas the current competitor’s standard search engines do not have such access into the deep web company description we were incorporated in nevada on july   under the name boomer ventures inc we intend to develop a deep internet search engine that uncovers the best deals on the internet the proposed search engine’s objectives are to allow users to uncover deals and websites that are usually overlooked by regular search engines it is too time consuming to check every website for travel used cars real estate coupons etc with this proposed deep search engine all relevant sites are searched to expose the best deals we have not yet commenced the development of our website began any proposed business operations and completion of the search engine is not a certainty we anticipate that our revenues will be chiefly derived from sales of advertising sponsorships of our internet website and fees for premium services paid by our users  our operational offices are located at posada del rey via italia punta paitilla ciudad de panama republica de panama and our telephone number is   our mailing
