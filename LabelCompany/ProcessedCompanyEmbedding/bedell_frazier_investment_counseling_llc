your favorite method of getting news sports or entertainment there are so many mediums in today’s digital age and longterm norms have been turned upside down remember when a phone was a phone when i moved back to san francisco from new york in  i didn’t get a landline phone and thought i was cutting edge today a growing population certainly don’t have landlines and don’t have cable or even television sets the average american adult spends over  hours per day consuming media content a recent study by deloitte found that we check our phones over  billion times per day that translates to an average of  times per person not surprisingly the younger you are the more often you check americans  on average check their phones  times per day chances are they’re not using it as a telephone either the  demographic really stands out with media statistics consumer behavior has changed so much over the years cable is a great example it took off in the ’s and my old boss ted turner was the pioneer before  less than  of americans had cable television it surged to over  by  pay tv usage expanded over the years with satellite added in and topped out in  with roughly  it’s expected to fall back towards  by the end of the decade  million people cut the cable cord last year that means they got rid of their cable service and are accessing content directly from the web nearly  of the country now access content away from the traditional pay multichannel tv model netflix has over  million subscribers of which half of them watch on a video game console over  watch from their computer a small but growing  watch from a cell phone attention spans have changed too nearly  of americans online watch television while they’re simultaneously on their phone or tablet does that sound like someone you know it’s expected to be over  next year americans are consuming content like never before over  of americans get their news on facebook for those of you who still enjoy the morning paper delivered to your home you’re not alone over half of americans that read the paper get it in print that also means that nearly half don’t just  of americans  read a newspaper at all do you love going to the movies summer is huge for the boxoffice did you know that movie theaters generate nearly  of their revenues across the month summer season but people don’t go to the movies like they used to and some argue the art of hollywood has been lost with quality story telling being replaced with highpriced action films and reruns whatever the case the traffic trend is undeniable in   of americans went to the movies at least once per week it was at the theater where people socialized and got news updates particularly during wwii they also saw cutting edge cartoons and other shorts it was a destination it was a way of life the advancement of televisions in the home reversed the movie traffic for good last year  of americans saw a movie in a theater at least once nearly half went at least once per month the age group that frequented theaters the most were age  averaging  movies in  this was surprising on one hand as this is the most techsavvy segment of our population but with many in the group in college or not working they have a little more free time then there’s this stat  of frequent moviegoers own at least  different types of technology devices such as smartphones tablets and videogame systems the tech savvy still like the cinema experience movie tickets have increased in price over the years today a movie in the bay area during primetime costs  a ticket to see gone with the wind in  cost  cents the original star wars cost  to see it the summer of  would you pay  to get a blockbuster film on your high def screen at home the same day it opens at the boxoffice you just may get the chance soon online video is available ondemand all the time giving users significantly more power to choose what they want to watch when they want it americans don’t seem to have the patience anymore to sit back and relax with a box of popcorn in the quiet sanctuary of the movie theater they can’t sit still in their own living room long enough without picking up their phones they’ve ditched the big screens for smaller screens disruptive business models have shaken the traditional norm to its core content providers have had to make drastic changes content distributors have been squeezed advertisers have to rethink everything these trends have been disruptive they’ve been evolutionary and they most certainly have been investable we pay close attention have a nice weekend

run sticky post by michael frazier on july   emerging markets on the run emerging markets have been running hot this year but you don’t really hear much about it investors are finally taking notice a decade and a half ago emerging markets were all the rage it was the bric nations that represented the greatest growth opportunity around the globe for investors bric stands for brazil russia india and china the bric nations got hit hard during the financial crisis and have only recently recovered emerging markets are up over  this year but are well below their alltime precrisis highs in fact they still remain below their  levels china is now the nd largest economy in the world but is still considered an emerging market of the  bric’s india stands out india is now the th largest economy in the world growing over  annually india’s economy is accelerating again and is on track to become  by the end of the decade prime minister narendra modi has been implementing economic reforms required to bridge the gap between the potential and the reality modi announced a plan to spend  billion on india’s infrastructure focusing on roads rail and airports also included in the plan is a massive tech buildout of servers networks and storage india is investing in themselves and their bright future apple has made a big push recently to capture the indian market the second largest market for phones the lack of internal infrastructure in india has led to many internetbased business models and they’re taking off india is where china was  years ago in terms of consumer spending but the opportunity for growth is enormous emerging markets account for  of the world’s population but only half of global gdp and less than  of global market cap ie total global stock market value importantly emerging markets will be responsible for over  of the economic growth in the coming years india and china are the fastest growers they also have the largest populations by a long shot with over  billion people each most emerging market nations have very young populations half of the world’s population is under the age of   out of  live in an emerging market besides the young populations emerging market nations share another common theme commodities emerging market nations in africa south america south east asia and the middle east are rich in raw materials when the global economy picks up momentum demand for raw materials like industrial metals agriculture and energy go with it global infrastructure and development is about building new stuff modern stuff that requires tons of raw materials these are longterm themes that look sustainable the dow and sp hit fresh alltime highs again this week the gains continue to come in the face of so much skepticism earnings season has just begun which will provide the necessary facts to confirm the health of this rally the global economy is expected to grow  this year while the us is slated for  growth emerging markets are expected to grow  leading the way and their stock markets have been playing catchup but remain well below their alltime highs for those concerned that the dow is too high rest assured there are plenty of investment

sticky post by meredith on july   big picture metrics as we turn the corner into the nd half of the year we thought it timely to show a few big picture metrics we follow to help give a sense of where the economy and markets sit jobs the june jobs report came out today and was about where we expected it to come in and stabilize the run rate of annual jobs created after the economy broke positive in  from the financial crisis we have averaged a run rate of  million jobs created annually today’s report puts us right back at that trend at  million created for reference the hottest peak labor market hiring was  million in february of  manufacturing  industrial production both hit new cyclical highs in june after peaking in late  if you recall we saw the sp  go through a flat period from  to early  as these numbers started to slow manufacturing  industrial production started to show expansion last fall which gave clues the economy was about to expand again after resting for a year and a half these are both humming along as expected for a strong fundamental backbone of the markets the bond market we saw the year treasury yield start  at  and drop to a low of  in june fast forward a few weeks and the year treasury yield is pushing back to  what was unique about this move down in interest rates at the longer end of the yield curve was how much the yield curve flattened because the front end actually rose what does that mean the yield curve is measured by taking the year yield or furthest out in time and subtracting the month bill or month bill yields or closest to today the yield curve was  steep as we began  now a few weeks ago the curve “flattened” from that  all the way down to  why is this important often times when the yield curve inverts or goes negative pays higher rates in the front maturities then the further out maturities it is a big sign of economic weakness and potential recession for reference the last “inverted” yield curve we saw was in  and we know what followed a year or so later the yield curve since that  low has “steepened” back towards  in a quick  weeks this is exactly what we want to be seeing in tandem with rates beginning to move back up the end of the curve is moving up more than the front again earnings  revenues earnings rose  and  for q and q respectively while revenues rose  and almost  for the first  quarters earnings are still on pace to grow around  for  and revenues around  which would be sufficient to earn  a share and support our  target on the sp  this year there will continue to be quick dips and vacillations along the way but from our perch these are not the characteristics of a stock market top they continue to look like very normal “late stage” economic cycle fundamentals have a nice

on june   the price we pay when you think of inflation what immediately comes to mind do you think about mortgage rates in the early ’s maybe the cost of a loaf of bread today or what a coke cost when you were  years old you probably cringe at the thought of how much you paid for that hot dog and beer at the ballgame the other day inflation is the general increase in price of a product good or service sometimes it’s driven by increased demand or reduced supply while it also can be a function of a higher cost to produce we see the results everyday anyone who has paid attention to california real estate over the years knows very well that prices have increased substantially over time a house purchased in san francisco in  is worth on average nearly x more  years later in  tickets to disneyland cost  it’s over  today a can of coke has doubled in cost from  years ago a call at a phone booth cost a dime in  while today it costs… wait a second what’s a phone booth so clearly there have been inflationary pressures over the years we certainly have seen it in the price of food healthcare and education but we’ve also seen some serious deflationary pressures as well intel founder gordon moore observed that computing power would increase over time while cost would decrease at an exponential pace moore’s law has proven a valuable force in pricing innovative products a inch television in  cost over  you can get a  inch hdtv today for under  stating the obvious the quality of the picture has improved quite a bit in  years while the price has dropped dramatically we’ve certainly experienced deflationary pressures in our industry the average trade commission for stocks was around  in  though some “full service” brokers charged as much as  electronic trades are under  today price at the pump gas prices have experienced both inflation and deflation over the years a gallon of gas cost  cents in  it’s  today when the price of oil reached  in  the national average was  per gallon and over  in california historically gas prices and oil prices have been a barometer for economic growth stronger demand implies economic growth which drives prices higher that hasn’t been the case of late because oil and gas prices today are driven by the increasing supply in the us which has outpaced demand importantly demand continues to grow particularly overseas some people have been concerned that falling oil prices means a recession is coming the deflationary pressure in gas prices is not a negative sign for economic growth in fact the lower prices are an important stimulant particularly for the american consumer which represents nearly  of the us economy the fed has been concerned about deflation ever since the crisis which is why they were so aggressive to increase the money supply with rounds of quantitative easing to help stoke inflation the fed has yet to achieve its goal of  inflation as measured by the consumer price index on a consistent basis part of the issue is we have been importing deflation for years in the form of chinese manufactured goods the amazon effect has driven consumer pricing down as well since commerce has become much more efficient this is a trend that should continue it’s great for consumers but can hurt jobs pay attention to prices this summer and think about what they used to be in some cases you’re paying a lot more for seemingly the same thing while in other cases you’re getting quite a bit more and paying much less of course i’m factoring in absolute dollars and not considering currency inflation and deflation which is another subject altogether i know my grandfather who passed away in  wouldn’t believe people today pay  for a bottle of water… have a nice weekend we’ll be back dark and early on monday mike tgif – the price we pay june rd michael frazier  jun  sticky post by michael frazier posted in weekly tgif permalink tgif – the amazon effect sticky post by michael frazier on june   the amazon effect the big news of the day the week and perhaps the decade for retail is amazon buying whole foods it looks like a really compelling fit amazon needed help cracking the urban retail market and whole foods needed help in pretty much everything amazon has a disruptive business model it has had the greatest influence on how people make purchases today the jeff bezos led company started off selling books amazon has shaken up every aspect of retail today they just torpedoed the grocery business amazon the disruptor amazon sent shockwaves throughout the north american retail chain with news it is buying whole foods in an allcash deal it will be the biggest deal in amazon history it will be the biggest deal in the history of the  billion grocery business with this deal amazon will immediately be the th largest grocer in the us it won’t stop there it’s going to be a game changer of great proportions amazon has built an empire and has proven that it can and will compete with nearly everyone the amazon effect has reached nearly every industry it changed the retail business it changed the server and storage business it has changed the logistics delivery and distribution business only amazon could get the mailman to work on sunday amazon has even disrupted hollywood breaking into show business when so many others failed amazon won an oscar this year the first time for a streaming video provider the company has been active in original content with amazon prime series for a few years the opportunities are boundless for amazon with these physical stores integrated with its web based stores there is quite a bit of overlap between its existing prime members and whole foods shoppers amazon has mastered the study of consumer behavior it has been tracking people’s purchases and searches for years and know more about people than they perhaps know about themselves it has so much data and metrics to analyze amazon has been an innovator in the artificial intelligence space and knows a great deal about human behavior and continues to sell people things that they want or need in a very efficient and easy manner amazon is pretty good at selling things that you don’t need too… amazon is paying nearly  billion for whole foods that comes down to roughly  million per store the grocery business is a tough business it’s hypercompetitive the profit margins are very low amazon knows low margin business it was clear that bezos wanted to get into the food business when he rolled out amazon fresh but early experiences saw the difficulty of providing fresh food sold over the web people generally don’t like bruised bananas and moldy berries most prefer to see the meat and touch the fruit before purchase having whole foods stores will enhance the amazon fresh pickup model where you have the option to buy merchandise online and pick it up within  minutes it’s clear that amazon doesn’t plan to stop here what amazon is likely thinking they just purchased over  upperincome area hubs throughout the country to distribute pretty much everything they sell competitors be warned what does this mean we ask ourselves this question all the time clearly all retail stores have been struggling and this will make things even more difficult drug stores are on watch too amazon could be a huge player in the prescription drug industry and it already thrives on selling dry goods warehouse stores like costco will feel the pressure but how about this online food delivery is expected to grow  times faster than the restaurant business through the end of the decade people would rather order meals online and have them delivered to their home than go out to eat these days amazon will no doubt capitalize on this trend there will be more white amazon vans coming to the neighborhood generally mega deals don’t work this one looks like it will it should be good for consumers but possibly bad for jobs amazon will drive already competitive prices even lower it should bring whole foods prices down too but it speeds up the irreversible trend towards automation that’s been a job crusher you know google and apple are watching with interest i saw an interesting tweet this morning which said that a summer job returning shopping carts in the parking lot just became an entry level position in high tech perhaps so it’s the digital age have a nice

state of the world sticky post by steve harris on june   planet earth is a confusing place trying to make sense of these global developments has been a challenge we are always up for challenges  the thing is these days information travels at the speed of light the problem is knowledge does not i had the great fortune of meeting former cia director and defense secretary leon panetta a couple of years ago this week i attended his lecture series with former secretary of state condoleezza rice and former defense secretary ash carter who succeeded panetta in  these are  of the smartest people on global issues the topic was the world and the focus was on russia north korea cybersecurity and the united states it was quite an event the discussion began with the established understanding that the united states is facing threats not seen since world war ii growing aggression and failed states are breeding grounds for terror foreign governments are behind much of the cyber espionage manipulation and theft how the international community is responding to these threats has changed in  the panel reminded us that the “international community” is a bit of a farce self interest always drives strategies pre world war i was a zerosum game driven by national interests post world war ii has seen global collaboration with democratic competition in relative peace the fact is americans have become “allergic” to war and nationbuilding overseas after afghanistan and iraq the populist movement created the trump presidency and brexit nato and the paris climate agreement is testing the strength of the west’s decade allegiances the current administration’s foreign policy is still evolving according the panel the one china policy and nato are examples of this secretary carter said that the us needs to stand for things and get what we want through competitive behavior with collaboration rice carter and panetta all agreed they would have advised the president to stay in the paris climate accord even though it is limited in what it can do condoleezza rice said she believes the us can and will continue to achieve economic growth in an environmentally conscientious way embracing sustainable energy sources with traditional the panel also reminded everyone that nothing will change until  at the earliest rice said that china leading the environmental push is a joke “have you tried to breathe the air in beijing recently” she quipped rice reminded the group that the us continues to lead as evidenced by its  reduction in carbon emissions output over the past several years naturally someone in the audience asked them about their thoughts on the president’s use of twitter they acknowledged it was a serious issue but was also a method that helped get him elected broadly speaking panetta rice and carter are concerned about the use of social media and politics “democracy takes time it takes listening and compromise” said secretary carter today people send out personal thoughts immediately often emotionally driven and it is documented forever having emotional thoughts and discussions is as old as humankind but they are best practiced behind closed doors in a professional forum they’re dangerous out in the open leaders need clear and consistent messages we don’t always get that right now  panetta institute via youtube as it pertains to russia and vladimir putin condoleezza rice had this to say “i know him pretty well and he is an eyeforaneye kind of person he is still unable to accept that the cold war ended as it did he called the end of the soviet union the greatest tragedy of the th century” rice said he always tries to project strength he only respects strength he thinks of himself as “vladimir the great” following the line of other russian and soviet leaders putin has played a weak hand masterfully as he has reasserted russian influence on the global stage the fact is the russian economy is a th century model driven by fossil fuels they are having trouble competing in the digital age but the weakening alliances in the west and the political infighting in the united states could not have been scripted better for the russian leader putin loves these disruptions an interesting observation that the panel made was what an effective move that secretary of state rex tillerson did when he said the russians are either complicit or incompetent in syria he called them on it to their face on russian ground that was an important moment vladimir putin makes sure that nobody questions his competency in closing mr panetta asked what issue kept them up at night ash carter gave a list in order of north korea russia iran and china but that his “job was to stay up at night so americans could sleep” condoleezza rice answered differently her greatest concern is that america loses the energy commitment and confidence to do the right thing as soon as we stop defending values the american way begins to dissolve “it would be an ugly world without us…” despite all of the problems we face america’s best days could absolutely lie ahead it won’t happen by itself we have a vibrant innovative economy and a way of life that is the envy of the world but there are serious issues to address there’s a great deal of anger and animosity listening and patience are being left behind we’re never going to agree on everything unfortunately compromise has become a fourletter word united we stand divided we fall have a nice weekend we’ll be back dark and early on monday – mike tgif – the state of the world june th steve

but a similar theme the stock market just doesn’t want to go down it had been trading sideways since march in a very tight range june started out with a bang and the rally continued with the dow and sp reaching fresh new highs it keeps happening in the face of so much turmoil and confusion in washington and around the globe many are just scratching their heads in disbelief it seems so counterintuitive but it shows that stocks are driven more so by earnings and corporate growth than politics and geopolitics friday brought a disappointing job report what’s worse both april and march were revised lower showing the labor market is not as strong as previously thought a big problem is the fact that some jobs can’t be filled due to the lack of qualified skills particularly in silicon valley it may also be a sign business leaders are reluctant to expand their workforce until they see more evidence the white house plans are translating into legislation that’ll simplify and lower taxes and accelerate growth our sense is this market had been pricing in tax reform and other progrowth policies being passed in early  not this year but it’s still very much up in the air with these revisions the month average of payroll gains was the weakest since  is the economy slowing or is it a temporary issue the bond market is showing some signs of concerns with the year treasury yield back below  for the first time this year money has been flowing into bonds of late seeking a little safety as a refresher bond yields drive prices when yields go up prices go down and vice versa will this new bit of uncertainty have the fed switching gears it doesn’t seem so with the futures market pricing in a  probability of another interest rate hike in  weeks we will find out soon enough one thing is certain there still is a great deal of skepticism out there as we’ve mentioned on numerous occasions bull markets generally grow on skepticism and die on euphoria there is very little euphoria out there but there is some brewing we’re starting to see it in tech where some stocks have been soaring while the broader market has not the top  stocks in the sp  are having a huge impact on this market rally they are apple google microsoft amazon and facebook case in point these  stocks represent a mere  of the  sp companies however they represent nearly  of the weighting of the index these  tech stocks have been the biggest drivers for the us stock market it’s even more pronounced when you consider the techheavy nasdaq the same  stocks represent over  of the weighting of the nas  index it’s a handful of stocks that are driving the rally it’s a momentum rally the bull market is maturing a rotation of leadership is overdue it’s needed for the next stage of this bull in our work

bitcoin is all the rage  the value surged in price crossing  for the first time  one bitcoin was worth nearly  on wednesday  it was worth  just a month ago  some of you might be wondering what exactly is bitcoin and where did it come from  bitcoin is what’s called a cryptocurrency  you don’t carry them in your pocket  it’s completely digital  bitcoin was created in japan in   the actual creator is unknown but believed to be a group of software programmers under the name “satoshi nakamoto” most retailers do not accept bitcoin for purchase but you might be surprised who does  bitcoin is accepted at the gap subway and whole foods  it can also be used on expedia and virgin airlines  there’s a bitcoin atm at a north beach market in san francisco and a gas station in concord california bitcoin runs through a digital network known as a blockchain  it keeps a secure record of each transaction all in one place every time anyone buys or sells bitcoin the transaction is logged  no one controls these blocks because blockchains are decentralized across every computer that has a bitcoin wallet which you only get if you buy bitcoins  it’s a very efficient system  competition in the digital currency space has been fierce  bitcoin used to account for over  of the market in february but is now just   one of its competitors zcash is up over  since it cut a deal with jp morgan chase  you can see why tech savvy consumers love it and government  regulators do not bitcoin’s anonymity also lends itself to crime  bad guys use them too  in fact the recent wannacry ransomware demanded payment in bitcoin  it was reported that disney was a victim and the new pirates of the caribbean film was being held for ransom despite the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies cash is still king  cash is convenient cash is private cash is intuitive cash does not require transactions costs  but cash really only works with direct handoff and can be clunky to carry and easy to be stolen or lost  in this digital age there absolutely is a pressing need for a digital currency that works  cryptocurrencies serve that purpose  it’s still very early in this trend  despite many attempts nothing rivals the us dollar today over  of consumer transactions in the united states are paid with cash  it is still the single largest source of payment  but if you combine debit and credit cards they account for nearly half of consumer spending habits  roughly  of all purchases are made online today and it’s certainly growing  bitcoin is included in this  checks and other electronic payments are less frequent but tend to account for the larger transactions  no surprise cash is more popular for smaller purchases  but outside the united states over  of transactions are paid in cash  cryptocurrencies will likely play a much bigger role overseas over time as new consumers enter global markets the world still loves dollars  it’s probably not a surprise that the  bill is the most common note in circulation  george washington’s face is on just over  of the  trillion federal notes in circulation  what might be a surprise is the  bill is in greater circulation than the  bill  it’s close  vs  of total but ben franklin wins out over old hickory  there are more  bills overseas than in the united states  have you ever wondered why our money is green  it was hard to copy which helped prevent counterfeiting  in  money was first printed with green ink on the back which quickly earned the name the “greenback”  knowledge is power these markets move fast but we’re all over it  have a fantastic

headline from one of our research sources this week the title is certainly an attention getter and many investors have been no doubt thinking this was possible if not probable but remember politics rarely drive markets earnings and economic activity take that role to be sure politics absolutely influence market activity government policies can both help and hurt investment as it applies to tax treatment and regulation among others but earnings and economic cycles are much more powerful and natural they’re demand driven politics feed on emotion which can be enhancers and detractors from progress these are indeed emotional times in which we live we do not think the bull market is coming to an end quite yet we have however prepared for increased volatility the market finally got rattled this week as the issues at the white house continued to escalate and the severity of the situation grew by the minute for most of the  months since president trump was elected the market has taken his controversial and unconventional behavior in stride the focus has been on earnings and economic acceleration both have been better than expected that is a really good thing but it feels a little different now and the controversy surrounding classified intelligence and russia is catching up to the president the prospects for tax reform and other progrowth policies are seemingly slipping away while the white house scrambles to maintain composure the market doesn’t like it and has begun repricing those expectations wednesday brought the biggest selloff on the year but keep in mind the sp  hit a fresh alltime high on monday the week ended on a high note for stocks but the weekend no doubt will be full of more news and events things still look ok under the hood no cause for panic yet the credit markets are functioning properly that wasn’t the case in previous corrections the yield curve has flattened a bit but mostly because the front end has increased which is normal with expected fed rate hikes the dollar is weak and has been for a while after hitting  year highs the dollar has erased all its gains for the year and is back at the level it was ahead of the election this is important because it suggests that the market believes there is risk to a strengthening us economy and the stability and predictability of the us government is actually in question but a weak dollar is good for american products overseas the only problem is global markets are still mired in the debate about free trade and fair trade that will likely continue our sense is the fed will be a little more careful with their interest rate hike campaign now in light of the washington turmoil a rate hike in june is still likely but beyond is very much in question for the first time in years money has been flowing out of us assets into international stocks gold has also been a recipient of money leaving the dollar we like our exposure in both these areas which we began building last year it was a big week for oil which broke above  again russia and saudi arabia the  largest oil producers agreed to extend production cuts for the rest of the year in an attempt to drive the price higher they’re also combatting the continued production acceleration in texas but global demand is increasing largely driven by india and china the global economy is showing signs of acceleration energy stocks have had a tough go this year but we believe higher levels are ahead earnings season is basically over and was very solid with the sp growing earnings over  in q it was the best quarter in years but the focus has turned towards geopolitics which brought more volatile price action to the mix so many investors haven’t trusted this rally and are shocked that the market has gone up as much as it has this year this bull market is definitely in the latter stages of its life low rates and slow growth are unique characteristics that could make it the longest in history right now it’s second only to the dotcomrally in the ’s as famed investor john templeton eloquently said “bull markets are born on pessimism grown on skepticism mature on optimism and die on euphoria” there is no euphoria today a dominant characteristic from the  prior bull markets that ended very poorly but bull markets don’t move in straightlines  either we are not getting overly aggressive to protect the downside as we still think there is more life in this bull yet but we did raise cash and initiate a hedge for a reason last week a healthy correction is coming the only question is when tighten those belts and
