be approximately  based upon the public offering price of  per share and  per warrant set forth on the cover page of this prospectus if the underwriters fully exercise the overallotment option we estimate the net proceeds of the common stock and warrants we sell will be approximately  “net proceeds” is what we expect to receive after paying the underwriting discount and other expenses of the offering a  increase decrease in the initial public offering price of  per share and  per warrant would increase decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately  assuming the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting underwriter discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to increase production for working capital and for other general corporate purposes including but not limited to financing our growth enhancing and improving our products and solutions diversifying our customer base enhancing our salesmarketing infrastructure funding capital expenditures costcutting activities including but not limited to business automation decrease in shipment costs repayment or refinancing of higher interest debt and outsourcing our logistics to reduce overall expenses expanding our existing business through investments in or acquisitions of other businesses solutions or technologies our actual allocation might differ from the list above and we do not have specific acquisition target at this time potential acquisitions will be considered on the basis of customerrelationships and proprietary technology except for the repayment of  senior secured redeemable debenture we have no specific plans for the proceeds of the offering until we use the net proceeds of the offering we will invest the funds in shortterm investment grade interestbearing securities or in savings accounts our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds our industry is characterized by intense competition supply shortages or oversupply rapid technological change evolving industry standards declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence we believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for our products and services include customer loyalty “coolness” and “buzz” product performance features acquisition cost and lifetime operating cost including maintenance and support ease of use integration with existing equipment quality reliability customer support brand and reputation the market for dronesuas is evolving rapidly and subject to changing technologies shifting customer needs and expectations and the potential introduction of new products we believe that a number of established domestic and international defense contractors have developed or are developing dronesuas that have and will continue to compete directly with our products these competitors may have significantly more financial and other resources than us our current principal dronesmall uas competitors include dr dji parrot yuneec and potentially gopro some of which have longer operating history and greater name recognition may have substantially greater financial technical marketing and other resources as a result these competitors may be able to better absorb price declines ensure more stable supply adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than us ultimately this may lead to a decrease in our sales and market share and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not view large uas manufacturers such as aai corporation aerovironment general atomics northrop grumman corporation and the boeing company as direct competitors because they are weapons and extendedflight surveillance platforms tend to be much higher priced and are not hand launched and locally controlled we cannot be certain that these platforms may not be direct competitors in the future in our consumer electronics markets we expect to face competition from existing or future competitors that design and market similar or alternative products that may be less costly andor provide additional features if a manufacturer of consumer electronics products develops products with similar features our revenues would decline which would result in a material adverse effect on or business company description we design manufacture and market consumer products — including recreational and commercial drones smart
