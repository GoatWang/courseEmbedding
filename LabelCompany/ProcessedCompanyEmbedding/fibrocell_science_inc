platform  our proprietary autologous fibroblast technology is the foundation for creating personalized biologics for diseases of the skin and connective tissue the science of autologous fibroblasts fibroblasts are the basis of fibrocell’s personalized cell and gene therapy platform because they are the most common cell in skin and connective tissue and are responsible for synthesizing extracellular matrix proteins including collagen that provide structure and support fibroblasts—the most common cells in the body—provide an ideal foundation for fibrocell’s personalized biologics   ubiquitous fibroblasts are present in all skin and connective tissue readily sourced from skin fibroblasts can be isolated from the skin and grown in culture the ability to genetically modify fibroblasts has been well documented in scientific literature functionally critical fibroblasts synthesize the structural framework of tissue ideal delivery vehicle fibroblasts have unique capabilities for localized vs systemic delivery to gene targets in the skin and connective tissue our entire fibroblast platform is done autologously this approach allows us to avoid many of the rejection concerns presented with allogeneic cells and results in a higher likelihood of efficacy” — john maslowski chief executive officer personalized biologics approach fibrocell’s autologous fibroblast technology uses our patented manufacturing process which involves collecting small skin biopsies from patients isolating cells and expanding them in culture transducing the fibroblast cells with an integrative lentiviral vector to express a targeted protein followed by continued expansion of the genemodified cells in culture in this manner each patient is treated with cells that were cultivated from his or her own dermal tissue ie autologous fibrocell is developing its genetherapy product candidates in collaboration with intrexon corporation nyse xon a leader in synthetic biology

 clinical trials our pipeline we are developing a robust pipeline of firstinclass autologous cell and gene therapies for diseases of the skin and connective tissue the most common cell in skin and connective tissue fibroblasts repair tissue infrastructure by producing extracellular matrix proteins including collagen our proprietary autologous fibroblast technology is the basis of our personalized biologics pipeline advantages of our approach using autologous fibroblasts as our technology platform provides distinct advantages for creating gene therapies fibroblasts are an ideal delivery vehicle to administer protein of interest locally localized administration avoids side effects typically associated with systemic therapy reduced rejection and immunogenicity concerns because autologous fibroblasts are compatible with the unique biology of each patient use of a third generation selfinactivating sin lentivirus accommodates large gene constructs due to packaging size allows for target gene integration ideal for longterm expression of the protein fibroblasts are geneticallymodified ex vivo—providing distinct safety and efficacy advantages enables testing for safety and confirmation of transduction rates and protein expression prior to administration reduces potential for host immune response upon retreatment as live virus is not administered directly into the patient our gene therapy candidates are being developed in collaboration with intrexon corporation a leader in synthetic biology personalized biologics pipeline fcx   for recessive dystrophic
