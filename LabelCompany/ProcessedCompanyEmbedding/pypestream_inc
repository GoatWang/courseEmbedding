google’s ios app now lets you tap and play gifs pypestream a new startup from adgenesisgenesis media cofounder richard smullen is announcing that it has raised  million in seed funding the round was led by jonah goodhart cofounder of moat and of earlystage investment firm wgi group goodhart told me that pypestream is trying to solve a big problem “the call center as a model is absolutely broken” in other words think about all the times you’ve tried to call customer service and how often it’s an “extraordinarily frustrating” experience how does smullen’s startup solve that well it doesn’t officially launch for another week or so and he wasn’t ready to share many details the aim at least is to create an experience that’s closer to messaging with your friend than it is to a traditional customer service call while still providing the enterprise features that businesses want smullen also said that he wants pypestream to become a platform “where businesses want to be found” — in fact you can already reserve your company name now but what exactly are you reserving well stay tuned for the launch in the meantime i guess i should remind you that smullen’s previous company adgenesis was a video advertising startup that merged with castle vision media to form an ad tech company called drumroll genesis media related articles genesis media raises m for ads that interrupt but hopefully dont annoy you adgenesis aims to be the matchcom of video advertising pair brands with the right viewer and here are the other investors mike walrath – investor at wgi and chairman of
