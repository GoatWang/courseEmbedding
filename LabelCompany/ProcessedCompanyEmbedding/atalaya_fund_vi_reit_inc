estate investment trusts all about reits reit     follow harrydomash real estate investment trusts high dividend payers reit directory  �  how to find the best property reits reits a way to invest in commercial real estate real estate investment trusts reits enable individual investors to participate in largescale incomeproducing real estate investments reits are a special form of corporation that by law must invest only in real estate in return for following that rule a reit does not have to pay us federal income tax if it pays out at least  of its net income in the form of dividends to its shareholders for the years  the irs allowed a reit to pay  of its dividends in stock rather than cash to qualify as a reit a company must meet the following requirements �  its assets must consist mostly of real estate held for longterm investment �  its income must be mainly derived from real estate and �  it must pay out at least  of its taxable income to shareholders equity reits vs mortgage reits there are two major categories of reits equity reits own physical properties such as apartment houses or shopping centers by contrast mortgage reits do not own real estate properties instead they invest in mortgages equity reits may invest in any type of real estate but most specialize in a particular property type reits pay attention to funds from operations ffo when analyzing reits you need to know that that taxable income is not necessarily the same as the net income shown in the quarterly or annual financial statements in fact most reits do not disclose their taxable income reported to the irs actually when it comes to analyzing a reits ability to pay dividends neither taxable income or financial statement net income means much thats because in both instances real estate property owners must deduct noncash depreciation expenses when they calculate income even if the property is in fact appreciating in value thus neither the taxable income nor the financial state numbers tell you anything about the cash available to pay dividends for that reason the reit trade association created a measure called funds from operations ffo which reflects the actual cash profits generated by a property reits operations almost all property reits include the funds from operations numbers in their quarterly reports more about reits no matter how you count it the federal rules require reits to pay out a large chunk of earnings to shareholders leaving little to fund expansion thus reits must raise capital by borrowing or by selling more shares to fund growth property reits are allowed to provide the customary management services associated with leasing properties such as apartment buildings shopping centers and office buildings but reits are not allowed to operate real estate that requires a high degree of personal service such as hotels and healthcare facilities however property reits can create affiliated companies that can provide management services in these sectors reit categories we have divided the reit universe into eleven categories retail shopping centers outlet centers small neighborhood centers or downtownheavily trafficked retail locations healthcare owners but not operators of healthcare facilities such as nursing homes medical office buildings hospitals etc lodging hotels motels and resort properties since lodging reits are not allowed to directly manage their hotel operations most hire nationally known hotel operators such as marriot or westin to run their properties those properties bear the name of the management company not the property owner industrial industrial warehouse distribution center or flex properties flex properties a recent innovation are singlestory buildings that could be configured as needed to be used as office light manufacturing andor warehouse space office office buildings are generally categorized as class a class b or class c depending on amenities and location class a typically located in downtown or upscale areas are the best class b buildings are usually in suburban neighborhoods class c buildings are typically older and in lowrent areas mixed industrialoffice these reits own both office and industrialwarehouse properties mortgagefinance reits that invest in existing mortgages or offer new mortgages or other types of financing residential apartment and manufactured home community owners digital infrastructure computer data centers telecomm towers operators and communications networks specialty selfstorage centers restaurant property owners and other reits that do not fit into the major categories diversified reits that own properties in multiple categories reit income tax considerations reit dividends are mostly taxed at ordinary income tax rates however after the yearend a reit may designate a portion of its prior years payouts as qualified dividends which qualify for the maximum  rate  on average roughly  of annual payouts fall into this category a reit may also classify portions of its prior year payouts as return of capital return of capital payouts reduce your cost basis and are not taxable until you sell your reit shares when they are taxed at the appropriate capital gains rate see the complete reit list in the reit directory want the best reits click here to subscribe to dividend detective best seller fundamental analysis handbook fire your

best preferreds preferred stock call prices � preferred stock returns preferred stock risks � preferred stock tax issues evaluating preferreds � preferred stock glossary preferred stocks primer while money market funds are paying next to nothing many preferred stocks are paying  to  preferred stocks basics corporations issue preferred stocks to raise cash although you buy or sell them the same way you trade regular stocks preferreds are more like bonds than common stocks investors buy them for the steady dividends which typically equate to  to  yields most preferreds pay dividends quarterly unlike common stocks you�re won�t enjoy much share price appreciation if your company comes up with a hot product further in most cases the dividend never goes up either the term �preferred� means that a firm must pay the dividends due on its preferred shares before it pays any common stock dividends also in theory if a company goes bankrupt preferred holders have priority over common stock shareholders however when a company fails both common and preferred shareholders usually get nothing finally another meaningless distinction unlike common stock holders preferred shareholders don�t get to vote on company proposals but in fact individual common shareholders have almost no influence on any corporations policies preferred stocks what you need to know when a company issues a preferred stock it sets the annual dividend and sells the shares at a preset price typically  but some are also  issued at   or  the initial yield called the �coupon rate� is the annual dividend divided by the issue price for instance the yield on shares paying year on shares issued at  is  however since preferreds trade on the open market just like regular stocks the actual trading price depends on supply and demand thus if the shares mentioned above slip to  the yield to new investors market yield rises to   divided by   preferred stock ticker symbols companies that issue preferred stocks typically sell more than one series for instance series a series b etc ticker symbols are not standardized and vary from site to site however they typically start with the issuers common stock symbol and end with the series designator for instance the ticker for bank of america bac series n preferreds might be bacn bacpn bacprn etc to find the ticker on a particular site use the symbol lookup function and enter the common stock ticker most sites respond with a list of all tickers starting with those letters from that list find the ticker ending with the desired series designator after youve done it once youll probably be able to find additional preferreds on the same site without needing the lookup function preferred stock call prices calling preferreds preferreds have minimum year maturities and some are perpetual meaning that the firm is not obligated to redeem them however most preferred stocks are �callable� meaning that the issuer has the right to call redeem them at the �call price� after a specified date call date typically fiveyears after issue the call price is usually as the original issue price but in some instances is slightly higher the issuer is not obligated to redeem the shares at the call date issuers are likely to call their preferreds if interest rates have dropped and they can save money by calling existing preferreds and selling a new batch paying lower rates thus depending on prevailing interest rates preferreds might continue to trade for years after the call date tired of getting next to nothing from your money market account click here to subscribe to dividend detective preferred stock returns preferred stock dividend yield a preferred stocks coupon rate defines its annual dividend but not the yield that you would receive if you bought the preferreds after the issue date for instance a  bond issued at  pays share annually  of  if the price drops and you only pay  per share your nominal yield would be   divided by  on the other hand  your yield would drop to  if you pay  for the shares which still might be acceptable depending on what banks are paying at the time preferred stock yield to call   for preferreds near or already past their call dates it�s important to know your potential return should they be called for instance say that you pay  per share for  coupon rate preferreds originally issued at  per share that can be called in months  even though youre collecting a nominal  yield you would lose share in months if the shares were called at that time factoring that in your actual return called the yield to call would drop to  rather than doing the math yourself use this handy calculator to determine your preferreds yield to call potential price appreciation ideally you would like to buy preferreds below their issue price assuming that the issuing corporation is a solid player and wont renege on its dividend obligations the preferreds will eventually move back up to their issue price if that happens you would enjoy capital appreciation in addition to the dividends for instance suppose that you buy shares originally issued at  but currently trading at  your capital appreciation potential is  and your nominal dividend yield is  obviously thanks to the capital appreciation potential the call date isnt an issue when you buy preferreds trading below their call price for example for the  coupon preferreds trading at  your yield to maturity would be  if they were called months after you purchased in practice though most companies wouldnt call preferreds trading significantly below their call prices instead they would simply buy them on the open market if they wanted to redeem them preferred stock risks preferred stock investors face three major risk factors  dividend suspension or company failure  rising interest rates and  low trading volumes  preferred dividend suspensioncompany failure firms that are facing cash flow problems will be tempted to suspend paying preferred stock dividends and in the worst case might file for bankruptcy either of those events would sink preferred share prices consequently preferred investors must understand the issuing corporations fundamental outlook preferreds issued by marginal corporations will look tempting because they will be trading at big discounts to their issue price thus be sure to do your homework before buying preferreds in that category many preferred stocks are rated by bond rating agencies such as moodys and standard  poors they use a combination of letters numbers and plus or minus signs such as aaa ba or b to rate the preferreds the details vary between agencies but all ratings starting with a and three letter ratings starting with b indicate investment quality sp investment quality ratings are aaa aa a and bbb below investment quality  best to worst are bb b ccc cc c and d sp may add a �� or �� to indicate that a rating falls near the top or bottom of a rating category moody�s investment quality ratings are aaa aa a and baa below investment quality best to worst are ba b caa ca and c moody�s may add a �� �� or �� to a rating to indicate that it falls near the top or bottom of a rating category  is best since issuers must pay moody�s or sp to be rated not all preferreds are rated unrated preferreds aren�t necessarily risky but they require more work since you�ll have to do the financial strength analysis on your own beware bondanalysts sometimes overlook the obvious for instance in  many didn�t realize that falling home prices would reduce the value of mortgages secured by those homes thus it�s up to you to keep up with the news and avoid industries with obvious problems preferred interest rate risk after the issuing companys financial outlook prevailing interest rates are the most important factor controlling preferred share prices if market rates rise preferred stock prices will probably drop and vice versa here�s why suppose that you own preferreds paying an initial  dividend yield for instance a preferred issued at  that pays dividends totaling  annually now say that prevailing corporate rates rise to  there would be no market for preferreds paying  at  per share instead buyers would only be willing pay  per share at that price the  annual dividend would equate to a  return  divided by  is  conversely if interest rates drop investors would be willing to pay more for you shares because they are yielding better than market returns thus the best time to own preferreds is when the outlook for corporate interest rates is steady or headed down trading volumes some preferred stocks are not widely followed and are lightly traded those are risky business because the lack of trading volume makes it difficult to move in or out of a position at a reasonable price avoid preferred stocks trading less than  shares daily on average preferred stock tax issues for reasons too involved to detail here the dividends from some preferreds are subject to the maximum  dividend tax rate while others are taxed as ordinary income that can make a big difference for instance  of dividends taxed at  nets out to roughly the same amount as  taxed at the maximum  ordinary tax rate for each preferred quantum online wwwquantumonlinecom specifies whether the  maximum rate applies corporations that have invested in other firm�s preferred shares in most instances enjoy a dividend received deduction that allows them to exclude  of dividends received from their taxable income quantum online also specifies whether each preferred qualifies for the corporate dividend received deduction how to evaluate preferred stocks evaluate preferreds by analyzing the issuing company�s financial strength what�s important is that the firm has the cash to pay its dividends it doesn�t matter if the issuer�s earnings came in below analysts� estimates or it said next quarter sales would be lower than previously forecast here are some selection criteria to keep in mind �  current price vs call price ideally the current preferred trading price would be below the call price and should never be more than  above the call price �  credit rating conservative investors should stick with investment grade any rating starting with a and threeletter b ratings �  trading volume minimum  shares traded daily on average �  issuers common stock trading price minimum  and higher is better �  issuing company analyst consensus buysell rating hold or better �  issuing company return on assets  or higher �  issuing company trailing months ttm operating cash

dividends  dividend detective has the tools you need click here to subscribe did you know that you only have to hold a stock for one day to collect a dividend that fact has inspired many investors to pursue �dividend capture� strategies that involve holding a stock just long enough to collect the dividend selling at or above their purchase price and then moving on   of course it�s not that easy for starters theoretically the share price drops by the dividend amount on the exdividend date but in fact many different factors influence a stock�s price movements on any given day and prices typically don�t drop by the exact dividend amount on the exdate   dividend capture definitions here are definitions that you need to know declaration date the day that a firm announces its next dividend such announcements are almost always made via a press release owner of record date the date that you must be registered as a shareholder to collect the next dividend you become the owner of record on the third business day after you purchased the shares exdividend date the first day that new buyers are not entitled to collect the next dividend the exdividend date is two business days before the owner of record date business days are days when new york city banks are open not stock market days in the case of very large dividends at least  of the share price to collect the dividend you cannot sell until at least one market day after the payment date payment date the day that the dividend should be deposited into your brokerage account thus in most instances you could purchase shares on the day prior to the exdividend date sell on the exdividend date and still collect the dividend on the payment date traditional dividend capture strategies traditional dividend capture strategies involve buying a stock before the exdividend date thus qualifying to collect the dividend and then selling some time later within that general framework traditional dividend capture players employ a variety of substrategies some try to buy before the dividend is announced some sell on the exdate while others wait for a stock to recover to a predetermined price before selling dividend capture is a controversial topic and not everybody believes that any capture strategy will be consistently profitable dividend capture income tax implications us tax rules say that you must hold a stock a least  days to be eligible for the maximum  dividend tax rate consequently some dividend capture investors try to hold for that period before selling alas such strategies are generally unproductive for starters doing so would limit you to six trades per year moreover there is no reason to believe that your trade would remain profitable after waiting that long you can mitigate these issues by limiting your dividend capture trades to taxsheltered accounts such as iras or roth iras if held in an ordinary ira dividends arent taxed until you begin taking distributions from that ira if held in a roth ira dividends are not taxed at all dds traditional dividend capture strategy resources dividend detectives exdividend calendar a premium feature lists all stocks going exdividend
