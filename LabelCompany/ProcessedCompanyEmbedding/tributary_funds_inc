predecessor common trust fund the common trust fund had investment objectives policies and restrictions restrictions and guidelines that were equivalent in all material respects to those of the fund and was managed by first national bank of omaha the fund commenced business on january   the performance of the predecessor fund was calculated net of the predecessor fund’s fees and expenses the

securities stocks are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments including investments in high grade fixed income securities the net asset value per share will fluctuate as the value of the securities in the portfolio changes common stocks and funds investing in common stocks generally provide greater return potential when compared with other types of investments   small capitalization funds typically carry additional risks since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure   stock funds are more volatile and carry more risk and return potential than other forms of investments bonds offer a relatively stable level of income although bond prices will fluctuate providing the potential for principal gain or loss cash equivalents offer low risk and low return potential   bond funds will tend to experience smaller fluctuations in value than stock funds however investors in any bond fund should anticipate fluctuations in price especially for
