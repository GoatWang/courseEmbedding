applicable separate account applicant moreover by substituting corresponding classes of shares of the replaced and substituting funds the owners who were subject to a b distribution plan will continue to be subject to such plan those owners who were not subject to a b distribution plan will not be subject to such plan after the substitution  in connection with the redemption of all shares of the

that it will comply with the requirements of rule a under the  act and the procedures established thereunder by the board of trustees of the trust  as noted above the portfolio securities received from the inkind redemption will be used together with the cash proceeds to purchase the shares of the substituting fund the applicants have determined that partially effecting the redemption of shares of the replaced fund inkind is appropriate based on the similarity of certain types of the portfolio securities that may be held by the replaced fund and the substituting fund the trust has advised the applicants that the valuation of any inkind transactions will be made on a basis consistent with the normal valuation procedures of the replaced fund and that of the substituting fund  the full net asset value of the redeemed shares held by the separate account applicants will be reflected in the owners contract values following the substitution the applicants represent that the owners will not bear any expenses for the substitution so that the full net asset value of redeemed shares of the replaced fund held by the separate account applicants will be reflected in the owners contract values following the substitution  the trust is fully advised of the terms of the substitution applicants anticipate that until the substitution occurs the trust will conduct the trading of portfolio securities in accordance with the investment objectives and strategies stated in the replaced funds prospectuses and in a manner that provides for the anticipated redemptions of shares held by the separate account applicants  applicants have determined based on advice of counsel familiar with insurance laws that the contracts allow the substitution as described in the application and that the transactions can be consummated as described therein under applicable insurance laws and under the contracts these contractual provisions have also been disclosed in the prospectus or statements of additional information relating to the contracts in addition prior to effecting the substitution applicants will have complied with any regulatory requirements they believe are necessary to complete the transactions in each jurisdiction where the contracts are qualified for sale  owners will not directly or indirectly incur any expense including brokerage expenses as a result of the substitution and the rights or obligations of the insurance company applicants under the applicable contracts will not be altered in any way the proposed substitution will not have any adverse tax consequences to owners the proposed substitution will not cause contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution the proposed substitution will not be treated as transfers for the purpose of assessing transfer charges the insurance company applicants will not with respect to shares substituted exercise any right it may have under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers for a period of thirtyone days from the mailing of the a notice of the substitution the “notice” to the owners the “free transfer period” in addition such a transfer will not be counted as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the contracts that limit the start printed page number of transfers that may be made without charge  the insurance company applicants have supplemented the prospectuses for the contracts to reflect the substitution within five days after the substitution the insurance company applicants will send to owners the notice which will identify the shares of the replaced fund that have been eliminated and the shares of the replaced fund that have been eliminated and the shares of the substituting fund that have been substituted the insurance company applicants will include in such mailing the applicable prospectus supplement for the contracts of the separate account applicants describing the substitution for those contracts that already include the substituting fund as an underlying variable investment option the insurance company applicants do not intend to mail a copy of the prospectus for the substituting fund to the owners because they already will have received a copy of those prospectuses in the ordinary course for those contracts that do not include the substituting fund the applicable insurance company applicants will have amended the applicable registration statement and will provide a copy of the prospectus supplement of the contract and the prospectus of the substituting fund with the notice owners will be advised in the notice that for a period of thirtyone days from the mailing of the notice owners may transfer all assets as substituted to any other available subaccount without charge or limitation and such transfers will not be counted toward any applicable limitation on transfers  the annual operating expenses of the

growth fundinternational fundadvisory and fund administrative chargesdistribution expensesother expensestotal expenses  as of december   the replaced fund and the substituting fund had the following net assets in millionsclass  sharesclass  sharespacific growth fundinternational fundpacific growth fundinternational fund  applicants represent that the insurance company applicants do not and will not for three years receive any direct or indirect benefit from the substituting fund or its adviser or the advisers affiliates that exceeds the amount it had received from the replaced fund its adviser andor the advisers affiliates including b shareholder service administration or other service fees revenue sharing or other arrangement either with specific reference to the substituting fund or as part of an overall business arrangement applicants legal analysis  section b of the  act provides that “it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission shall have approved such substitution” section b of the  act was enacted as part of the investment company act amendments of  prior to the enactment of these amendments a depositor of a unit investment trust could substitute new securities for those held by the trust by notifying the trusts security holders of the substitution within five  days after the substitution in  the commission concerned with the high sales charges then common to most unit investment trusts and the disadvantageous position in which such charges placed investors who did not want to remain invested in the substituted security recommended that section  be amended to require that a proposed substitution of the underlying investments of a trust receive prior commission approval  applicants represent that the purposes terms and conditions of the substitution are consistent with the principles and purposes of section b and do not entail any of the abuses that section b is designed to prevent owners will be assessed no charges whatsoever in connection with the substitution and their annual fund expense ratios are expected to decrease in addition to the extent an owner does not wish to participate in the substitution he or she will have thirty one days to transfer to any other option available under the relevant contract prior to the substitution and after the substitution without any transfer fee moreover as described below applicants assert that the owners will be substituted into a substituting fund whose investment objectives policies and expenses are substantially similar or identical in all material respects to those of the replaced fund  applicants submit that the substitution does not present the type of costly forced redemption or other harms that section b was intended to guard against and is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the  act and assert the following in support of this contention a the substitution will continue to fulfill owners objectives and risk expectations because the investment objectives of the pacific growth fund are substantially similar to those of the international fund b after receipt of the notice informing an owner of the substitution an owner may request that his or her assets be reallocated to another subaccount at any time during the free transfer period the free transfer period provides sufficient time for owner to consider their reinvestment options c the substitution will be at net asset value of the respective shares without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge d neither the owners the replaced fund nor the substituting fund will bear any cost of the substitution and accordingly the substitution will have no impact on the owners contract valuesstart printed page  e the substitution will in no way alter the contractual obligations of the respective insurance company applicants or the rights and privileges of owners under the contracts f the substitution will in no way alter the tax benefits to owners and g the substitution is expected to confer certain economic benefits on owners by virtue of enhanced asset size and lower expenses as described above  applicants contend that the substituting fund and the replaced fund share similar investment objectives the pacific growth fund and the international fund seek to provide longterm capital growth the pacific growth fund pursues its objectives by investing primarily in common stocks of pacific rim companies and under normal conditions at least  of its total assets in equity securities that trade in pacific rim markets including those in emerging markets the international fund pursues its objectives by investing at least  of its total assets in equity securities of companies located outside the us including those in emerging markets the manager for each of these funds employs the same investment philosophy of bottomup valueoriented longterm selection of portfolio securities thus both funds invest primarily in equity securities of companies located outside the us and employ the same investment selection strategy moreover morningstar inc classifies the pacific growth and international funds as large capitalization stock funds  applicants assert that the primary difference between the pacific growth fund and the international fund is their concentration in a particular region as of september   the international fund invested approximately  in european issuers and approximately  in asian issuers as of september   the pacific growth fund invested  in asian issuers the applicants do not believe that these differences are significant particularly because of the lack of interest in the pacific growth fund as shown in its smaller size and the more concentrated regional focus of the pacific growth fund is likely to be a factor in its lower performance the applicants also considered that owners likely invest in the pacific growth fund as a means to diversify their assets into foreign equity securities the international fund will also enable owners to achieve this diversification goal accordingly applicants believe that the international fund is a suitable replacement for owners to continue their investment in foreign equity securities  applicants state that the insurance company applicants have specifically determined that the substituting fund is an approximate investment vehicle for owners who have allocated value to the replaced fund and that the substitution will be consistent with owners investment objectives  applicants assert that the fees and expenses of the substituting fund have historically been less than those of the replaced fund and accordingly that the proposed substitution poses no concerns in connection with the fees and expenses that will arise therefrom  applicants assert that the substituting fund has significantly more assets than the replaced fund it is expected that the lower expense ratios should continue as a result of the significantly greater assets of the substituting fund  applicants state that the returns of the substituting fund have consistently been substantially higher than the returns of replaced fund while there is no guarantee that past performance will continue applicants state that the substitution is not expected to give rise to diminution in performance or other adverse effects on contract values  section a of the  act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of an affiliated person from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company section a of the  act prohibits any of the persons described above from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company section a of the  act defines the term “affiliated” person the proposed substitution will be effected in part through inkind redemptions and purchases and may be deemed to entail the indirect purchase of shares of the related substituting fund with portfolio securities of the replaced fund and the indirect sale of securities of the replaced fund for shares of the substituting fund  in addition the insurance company applicants as appropriate will combine the subaccount investing in the pacific growth fund and the continuing subaccount investing in the international fund applicants state that the insurance company applicants could be said to be transferring unit values between their respective subaccounts and that the transfer of unit values could be said to involve purchase and sale transactions between subaccounts that are affiliated persons applicants further state that the sale and purchase transactions between subaccounts could be said to come within the scope of section a and a of the  act respectively and that the substitution involving the combination of subaccounts may require an exemption from section a of the  act pursuant to section b of the  act  section b of the  act provides that the commission may grant an order exempting transactions prohibited by section a of the  act upon application if evidence establishes that a the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned b the proposed transaction is consistent with the investment policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the  act and c the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the  act the applicants represent that the terms of the proposed transactions as described in this application are reasonable and fair including the consideration to be paid and received do not involve overreaching are consistent with the policies of the replaced fund of the trust and are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  applicants represent that for all the reasons stated above with regard to section b of the  act the substitution is reasonable and fair it is expected that existing and future owners will benefit from the consolidations of assets in the substituting fund the transactions effecting the substitution will be effected in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder moreover the partial inkind redemptions of portfolio securities of the replaced fund will be effected in conformity with rule a under the  act and the procedures of the trust established pursuant to rule a applicants contend that the owners interests after the substitution in practical economic terms will not differ in any measurable way from such interests immediately prior to the substitution and that in each case the consideration to be received and paid is therefore reasonable and fair applicants conclusions applicants submit for all the reasons stated herein that their requests meet the standards set out in sections c b and b of the  act and that start printed page an order should therefore be granted accordingly applicants request an order pursuant to sections c b and b of the  act approving the substitution of shares of the pacific growth fund with shares of the international fund start signature for the

investment allocations that were in place on the income date if you choose to have any portion of your annuity payments come from the funds the dollar amount of your payment will depend upon three things  the value of your contract in the funds on the income date  the  assumed investment rate used in the annuity table for the contract and  the performance of the funds you selected if the actual performance exceeds the  assumed rate your annuity payments will increase similarly if the actual rate is less than  your annuity payments will decrease annuity options you can choose one of the

for aip to begin that same month investments will take place on the th of the month or the next business day the minimum investment that can be made by aip is  you may stop aip at any time you want we need to be notified by the first of the month in order to stop or change aip that month if aip is used for a qualified contract you should consult your tax adviser for advice regarding maximum contributions allocation of purchase payments when you purchase a contract we will allocate your purchase payment to the fixed account andor one or more of the funds you have selected we ask that you allocate your money in either whole percentages or round dollars the fixed account may not be available in your state check with your registered representative you can instruct us how to allocate additional purchase payments you make if you do not instruct us we will allocate them in the same way as your previous instructions to us allianz life reserves the right to limit the number of funds that you may invest in at one time currently you may invest in  investment options at one time which includes any of the  funds of franklin valuemark funds listed in section  and the allianz life fixed account we may change this in the future however we will always allow you to invest in at least five funds once we receive your purchase payment the necessary information and federal funds federal funds means monies credited to a banks account with its regional federal reserve bank we will issue your contract and allocate your first purchase payment within  business days if you do not give us all of the information we need we will contact you to get it if for some reason we are unable to complete this process within  business days we will either send back your money or get your permission to keep it until we get all of the necessary information if you make additional purchase payments we will credit these amounts to your contract within one business day our business day closes when the new york stock exchange closes which is usually at  pm eastern time free look if you change your mind about owning the contract you can cancel it within  days after receiving it or the period required in your state when you cancel the contract within this time period allianz life will not assess a contingent deferred sales charge you will receive back whatever your contract is worth on the day we receive your request in certain states or if you have purchased the contract as an ira we may be required to give you back your purchase payment if you decide to cancel your contract within  days after receiving it or whatever period is required in your state if that is the case we reserve the right to put your purchase payment in the money market fund for  days after we issue your contract in some states the period may be longer at the end of that period we will reallocate those funds as you selected currently however we will directly allocate your money to the funds andor the fixed account as you have selected accumulation units the value of the portion of your contract allocated to the funds will go up or down depending upon the investment performance of the funds you choose the value of your contract will also depend on the expenses of the contract in order to keep track of the value of your contract we use a measurement called an accumulation unit which is like a share of a mutual fund during the income phase of the contract we call it an annuity unit every business day we determine the value of an accumulation unit for a fund by multiplying the accumulation unit value for the previous period by a factor for each fund for the current period the factor for each fund is determined by  dividing the value of a fund share at the end of the current period by the value of a fund share for the previous period and  multiplying it by one minus the daily amount of the insurance charges and any charges for taxes the value of an accumulation unit may go up or down from day to day when you make a purchase payment we credit your contract with accumulation units the number of accumulation units credited is determined by dividing the amount of the purchase payment allocated to a fund by the value of the accumulation unit for that fund we calculate the value of an accumulation unit for each fund after the new york stock exchange closes each day and then credit your contract example on wednesday we receive an additional purchase payment of  from you you have told us you want this to go to the growth and income fund when the new york stock exchange closes on that wednesday we determine that the value of an accumulation unit for the growth and income fund is  we then divide  by  and credit your contract on wednesday night with  accumulation units

instructions dollar cost averaging program the dollar cost averaging program allows you to systematically transfer a set amount of money each month or quarter from any one fund or the fixed account to up to eight of the other funds by allocating amounts on a regularly scheduled basis as opposed to allocating the total amount at one particular time you may be less susceptible to the impact of market fluctuations you may only participate in this program during the accumulation phase you must participate in the program for at least six months or two quarters and must transfer at least  each time or  each quarter your allocations can be in whole percentages or dollar amounts the funds you transfer from may not be the funds you transfer to in this program you may elect this program by properly

the transfer will be made the next business day your participation in the program will end when any of the following occurs  the number of desired transfers have been made  you do not have enough money in the funds or fixed account to make the transfer if less money is available that amount will be dollar cost averaged and the program will end  you request to terminate the program your request must be received by us by the first of the month to terminate that month  the contract is terminated or  we receive proof of the contract owners death if you participate in the dollar cost averaging program the transfers made under the program are not taken into account in determining any transfer fee you may not participate in the dollar cost averaging program and flexible rebalancing at the same time flexible rebalancing once your money has been invested the performance of the funds and the earnings from the fixed account may cause your allocation to shift flexible rebalancing is designed to help you maintain your specified allocation mix between the different funds you can direct us to readjust your money on a quarterly semiannual or annual basis to return to your original allocations flexible rebalancing transfers will be made on the th day of the month unless that day is not a business day if it is not then the transfer will be made on the previous day if you participate in the flexible rebalancing program the transfers made under the program are not taken into account in determining any transfer fee the fixed account is not permitted to be part of flexible rebalancing voting rights allianz life is the legal owner of the fund shares however allianz life believes that when a fund solicits proxies in conjunction with a shareholder vote it is required to obtain from you and other contract owners instructions as to how to vote those shares when we receive those instructions we will vote all of the shares we own in proportion to those instructions this will also include any shares that allianz life owns on its own behalf should allianz life determine that it is no longer required to comply with the above we will vote the shares in our own right substitution allianz life may be required to substitute one of the funds you have selected with another fund we would not do this without the prior approval of the securities and exchange commission we will give you notice of our intention to do this  expenses there are charges and other expenses associated with the contract that will reduce your investment return these charges and expenses are insurance charges each day allianz life makes a deduction for its insurance charges allianz life does this as part of its calculation of the value of the accumulation units and the annuity units the insurance charge has two parts  the mortality and expense risk charge and  the administrative charge mortality and expense risk charge  during the accumulation phase this charge is equal on an annual basis to  of the average daily value of the contract invested in a fund after the deduction of expenses during the income phase the charge is equal on an annual basis to  of the average daily value of the contract invested in a fund after the deduction of expenses this charge compensates us for all the insurance benefits provided by your contract for example the guarantee of annuity rates the death benefits certain expenses related to the contract and for assuming the risk expense risk that the current charges will be insufficient in the future to cover the cost of administering the contract the amount of the mortality and expense risk charge is less during the income phase because allianz life does not pay a death benefit if you die during the income phase if this charge is not sufficient then allianz life will bear the loss allianz life does however expect to profit from this charge the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased allianz life may use any profits it makes from this charge to pay for the costs of distributing the contract administrative charge  this charge is equal on an annual basis to  of the average daily value of the contract invested in a fund after the deduction of expenses this charge together with the contract maintenance charge which is explained below is for all the expenses associated with the administration of the contract some of these expenses include preparation of the contract confirmations annual reports and statements maintenance of contract records personnel costs legal and accounting fees filing fees and computer and systems costs because this charge is taken out of every unit value you may pay more in administrative costs than those that are associated solely with your contract allianz life does not intend to profit from this charge however if this charge and the contract maintenance charge are not enough to cover the costs of the contracts in the future allianz life will bear the loss contract maintenance charge every year on the anniversary of the date when your contract was issued allianz life deducts  from your contract as a contract maintenance charge this charge is for administrative expenses see above this charge can not be increased however during the accumulation phase if the value of your contract is at least  when the deduction for the charge is to be made allianz life will not deduct this charge if you own more than one valuemark iv contract allianz life will determine the total value of all your contracts if the total value of all contracts registered under the same social security number is at least  allianz life will not assess the contract maintenance charge except in new jersey if the contract is owned by a nonnatural person eg a corporation allianz life will look to the annuitant to determine if it will assess the charge if you make a complete withdrawal from your contract the contract maintenance charge will also be deducted during the income phase the charge will be collected monthly out of each annuity payment contingent deferred sales charge withdrawals may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge during the accumulation phase you can make withdrawals from your contract allianz life keeps track of each purchase payment you make the amount of the contingent deferred sales charge depends upon how long allianz life has had your payment the charge is download table number of complete years from receipt of payment         or more contingent deferred sales charge         however after allianz life has had a purchase payment for  years there is no charge when you withdraw that purchase payment for purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge allianz life treats withdrawals as coming from the oldest purchase payments first allianz life does not assess the contingent deferred sales charge on any payments paid out as annuity payments or as death benefits note for tax purposes withdrawals are considered to have come from the last money you put into the contract thus for tax purposes earnings are considered to come out first free withdrawal amount  each year after the first contract year you can make multiple withdrawals up to  of the value of your contract and no contingent deferred sales charge will be deducted from the  you take out withdrawals in excess of that free amount will be subject to the contingent deferred sales charge you may also select to participate in the systematic withdrawal program or the minimum distribution program which allow you to withdraw money without the deduction of the contingent deferred sales charge under certain circumstances see section   access to your money for a description of the systematic withdrawal program and the minimum distribution program waiver of contingent deferred sales charge benefits under certain circumstances after the first year allianz life will permit you to take your money out of the contract without deducting a contingent deferred sales charge  if you become confined to a nursing home  if you become terminally ill which is defined as life expectancy of  months or less a full surrender of the contract will be required or  if you become totally disabled for at least  days also after the first year if you become unemployed for at least  days you can take up to  of your money out without incurring a contingent deferred sales charge this benefit is available only once during the life of the contract and you may not use both this benefit and the  free withdrawal amount in the same contract year these benefits may not be available in your state reduction or elimination of the contingent deferred sales charge allianz life will reduce or eliminate the amount of the contingent deferred sales charge when the contract is sold under circumstances which reduce its sales expenses some examples are if there is a large group of individuals that will be purchasing the contract or a prospective purchaser already had a relationship with allianz life allianz life will not deduct a contingent deferred sales charge under a contract issued to an officer director or employee of allianz life or any of its affiliates also allianz life will not deduct a contingent deferred sales charge when a contract is sold by an agent of allianz life to any members of his or her immediate family and the commission is reduced any circumstances resulting in reduction or elimination of the contingent deferred sales charge requires prior approval of allianz life transfer fee you can make  free transfers every year we measure a year from the day we issue your contract if you make more than  transfers a year we will deduct a transfer fee of  or  of the amount that is transferred whichever is less for each additional transfer if the transfer is part of the dollar cost averaging program or flexible rebalancing it will not count in determining the transfer fee premium taxes some states and other governmental entities eg municipalities charge premium taxes or similar taxes allianz life is responsible for the payment of these taxes and will make a deduction from the value of the contract for them some of these taxes are due when the contract is issued others are due when annuity payments begin it is allianz lifes current practice to not charge you for these taxes until you die annuity payments begin or a complete withdrawal is made allianz life may some time in the future discontinue this practice and assess the charge when the tax is due premium taxes generally range from  to  depending on the state income taxes allianz life will deduct from the contract for any income taxes which it may incur because of the contract currently allianz life is not making any such deductions fund expenses there are deductions from and expenses paid out of the assets of the various funds which are described in the attached prospectus for franklin valuemark funds  taxes note allianz life has prepared the following information on taxes as a general discussion of the subject it is not intended as tax advice you should consult your own tax adviser about your own circumstances allianz life has included additional information regarding taxes in the statement of additional information annuity contracts in general annuity contracts are a means of setting aside money for future needs usually retirement congress recognized how important saving for retirement was and provided special rules in the internal revenue code code for annuities basically these rules provide that you will not be taxed on the earnings on the money held in your annuity contract until you take the money out this is referred to as tax deferral there are different rules regarding how you will be taxed depending upon how you take the money out and the type of contract qualified or nonqualified see following sections you as the owner will not be taxed on increases in the value of your contract until a distribution occurs  either as a withdrawal or as annuity payments when you make a withdrawal you are taxed on the amount of the withdrawal that is earnings for annuity payments different rules apply a portion of each annuity payment you receive will be treated as a partial return of your purchase payments and will not be taxed the remaining portion of the annuity payment will be treated as ordinary income how the annuity payment is divided between taxable and nontaxable portions depends upon the period over which the annuity payments are expected to be made annuity payments received after you have received all of your purchase payments are fully includible in income when a nonqualified contract is owned by a nonnatural person eg a corporation or certain other entities other than taxqualified trusts the contract will generally not be treated as an annuity for tax purposes this means that the contract may not receive the benefits of taxdeferral income may be taxed as ordinary income every year qualified and nonqualified contracts if you purchase the contract under a qualified plan your contract is referred to as a qualified contract examples of qualified plans are individual retirement annuities iras taxsheltered annuities sometimes referred to as b contracts hr  plans sometimes referred to as keogh plans and pension and profitsharing plans which include k plans if you do not purchase the contract under a qualified plan your contract is referred to as a nonqualified contract withdrawals  nonqualified contracts if you make a withdrawal from your contract the code treats such a withdrawal as first coming from earnings and then from your purchase payments in most cases such withdrawn earnings are includible in income the code also provides that any amount received under an annuity contract which is included in income may be subject to a tax penalty the amount of the penalty is equal to  of the amount that is includible in income some withdrawals will be exempt from the penalty they include any amounts  paid on or after the taxpayer reaches age    paid after you die  paid if the taxpayer becomes totally disabled as that term is defined in the code  paid in a series of substantially equal payments made annually or more frequently for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer  paid under an immediate annuity or  which come from purchase payments made prior to august   withdrawals  qualified contracts the above information describing the taxation of nonqualified contracts does not apply to qualified contracts there are special rules that govern qualified contracts a more complete discussion of withdrawals from qualified contracts is contained in the statement of additional information withdrawals  taxsheltered annuities the code limits the withdrawal of purchase payments made by owners from certain taxsheltered annuities withdrawals can only be made when a contract owner  reaches age   leaves hisher job  dies  becomes disabled as that term is defined in the code or  in the case of hardship however in the case of hardship the contract owner can only withdraw the purchase payments and not any earnings diversification the code provides that the underlying investments for a variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements in order to be treated as an annuity contract allianz life believes that the funds are being managed so as to comply with the requirements neither the code nor the internal revenue service regulations issued to date provide guidance as to the circumstances under which you because of the degree of control you exercise over the underlying investments and not allianz life would be considered the owner of the shares of the funds if this occurs it will result in the loss of the favorable tax treatment for the contract it is unknown to what extent under federal tax law contract owners are permitted to select funds to make transfers among the funds or the number and type of funds contract owners may select from if any guidance is provided which is considered a new position then the guidance would generally be applied prospectively however if such guidance is considered not to be a new position it may be applied retroactively this would mean that you as the owner of the contract could be treated as the owner of the funds due to the uncertainty in this area allianz life reserves the right to modify the contract in an attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment  access to your money you can have access to the money in your contract  by making a withdrawal either a partial or a total withdrawal  by receiving annuity payments or  when a death benefit is paid to your beneficiary withdrawals can only be made during the accumulation phase when you make a complete withdrawal you will receive the value of the contract on the day you made the withdrawal less any applicable contingent deferred sales charge less any premium tax and less any contract maintenance charge see section   expenses for a discussion of the charges any partial withdrawal must be for at least  and unless you instruct allianz life otherwise and will be made prorata from all the funds and the fixed account you selected allianz life requires that after you make a partial withdrawal the value of your contract must be at least  income taxes tax penalties and certain restrictions may apply to any withdrawal you make there are limits to the amount you can withdraw from a qualified plan referred to as a b plan for a more complete explanation see section   taxes and the discussion in the sai systematic withdrawal program if the value of your contract is at least  allianz life offers a program which provides automatic monthly or quarterly payments to you each year the total systematic withdrawals which you can make each year without allianz life deducting a contingent deferred sales charge is limited to  of the value of your contract on the day the request is received you may withdraw any amount you want under this program if your payments are no longer subject to the contingent deferred sales charge you may not participate in this program if you own a nonqualified contract and are under age   if you make withdrawals under this program you may not also use the  free withdrawal amount that year for a discussion of the contingent deferred sales charge and the  free withdrawal amount see section   expenses all systematic withdrawals will be made on the th day of the month unless that day is not a business day if it is not then the withdrawal will be made the previous business day income taxes may apply to systematic withdrawals minimum distribution program if you own a contract that is an individual retirement annuity ira you may select the minimum distribution program under this program allianz life will make payments to you that are designed to meet the applicable minimum distribution requirements imposed by the internal revenue code for iras if the value of your contract is at least  allianz life will make payments to you on a monthly or quarterly basis the payments will not be subject to the contingent deferred sales charge and will be instead of the  free withdrawal amount suspension of payments or transfers allianz life may be required to suspend or postpone payments for withdrawals or transfers for any period when  the new york stock exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings  trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted  an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the fund shares is not reasonably practicable or allianz life cannot reasonably value the fund shares  during any other period when the securities and exchange commission by order so permits for the protection of contract owners allianz life has reserved the right to defer payment for a withdrawal or transfer from the fixed account for the period permitted by law but not for more than six months  performance allianz life periodically advertises performance of the various funds allianz life will calculate performance by determining the percentage change in the value of an accumulation unit by dividing the increase decrease for that unit by the value of the accumulation unit at the beginning of the period this performance number reflects the deduction of the insurance charges it does not reflect the deduction of any applicable contingent deferred sales charge and contract maintenance charge the deduction of any applicable contract maintenance charge and contingent deferred sales charges would reduce the percentage increase or make greater any percentage decrease any advertisement will also include average annual total return figures which reflect the deduction of the insurance charges contract maintenance charge contingent deferred sales charges and the expenses of the funds allianz life may also advertise aggregate total return information aggregate total return is determined the same way except that the results are not annualized certain funds have been in existence for some time and have investment performance history however the contracts are new in order to demonstrate how the actual investment experience of the funds may affect your accumulation unit values allianz life has prepared hypothetical performance information part a of the appendix to this prospectus the performance is based on the performance of the funds modified to reflect the charges and expenses of your contract as if it had been in existence for the time periods shown the information is based upon the historical experience of the funds and does not necessarily represent what your investment would earn in those funds the mutual shares securities fund and the mutual discovery securities fund new valuemark funds are newly created and therefore also do not yet have any meaningful performance history however they have the same investment objectives and portfolio managers and substantially the same investment policies as two corresponding series of franklin mutual series fund inc formerly mutual series fund inc which have been sold to the public public funds in order to show how the performance of the public funds would have affected accumulation unit values hypothetical performance information was developed part b of the appendix to this prospectus shows the historical performance of the public funds which reflects the deduction of the historical fees and expenses paid by the public funds and not those paid by the new valuemark funds there are hypothetical performance figures for the accumulation units which assume the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge the administrative charge and the fees and expenses that the public funds paid there are also hypothetical performance figures for the accumulation units which reflect the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge the administrative charge the contingent deferred sales charge the contract maintenance charge and the fees and expenses that the public funds paid the hypothetical performance figures for the accumulation units have not been restated to reflect the higher fees for the new valuemark funds if the higher fees were used the hypothetical performance shown would be lower future performance may vary and the results shown are not necessarily representative of future results allianz life may in the future also advertise yield information for one or more of the funds if it does it will provide you with information regarding how yield is calculated more detailed information regarding how performance is calculated is found in the sai any performance advertised will be based on historical data and does not guarantee future results of the funds  death benefit upon your death if you die during the accumulation phase allianz life will pay a death benefit to your beneficiary see below no death benefit is paid during the income phase if you have a joint owner and the joint owner dies the surviving owner will be considered the beneficiary joint owners must be spouses except in pennsylvania and oregon the death benefit will be the greater of  the current value of your contract less any taxes on the day all claim proofs and payment election forms are received by allianz life at the valuemark service center or  as set forth in the enhanced death benefit endorsement to the contract the guaranteed minimum death benefit less any taxes as of the day you die certain contract owners will not receive an enhanced death benefit endorsement for these owners the death benefit is as set forth in item no  above during the first year the guaranteed minimum death benefit is equal to the payments you have made less any money you have taken out and any charges paid on the money you have taken out after the first year and before your th birthday the guaranteed minimum death benefit is the greater of a payments you have made less any money you have taken out and charges paid on the money you have taken out increased by  per year on each contract anniversary or b the highest of the contract values for each six year contract anniversary determined by the contract value on such six year anniversary plus any payments made less any money taken out since that contract anniversary and charges paid on the money you have taken out after your th birthday the guaranteed minimum death benefit will only be increased by any payments you have made since the last contract anniversary before your th birthday less any money you have taken out and any charges paid on the money you have taken out since such contract anniversary if you have a joint owner the age of the oldest owner will be used to determine the guaranteed minimum death benefit the guaranteed minimum death benefit will be reduced by any amounts withdrawn after the date of death if the contract is owned by a nonnatural person then all references to you mean the annuitant the death benefit provision described above may not be available in your state if it is not available the death benefit will be equal to the value of your contract less any premium taxes on the business day that allianz life receives proof of the death and payment instructions a beneficiary may request that the death benefit be paid in one of the following ways  payment of the entire death benefit within  years of the date of death or  payment of the death benefit under an annuity option the death benefit payable under an annuity option must be paid over the beneficiarys lifetime or for a period not extending beyond the beneficiarys life expectancy payment must begin within one year of the date of death if the beneficiary is the spouse of the contract owner heshe can choose to continue the contract in hisher own name at the then current value or if greater the death benefit value if a lump sum payment is elected and all the necessary requirements are met the payment will be made within  days if you or any joint owner die during the income phase and you are not the annuitant any payments which are remaining under the annuity option selected will continue at least as rapidly as they were being paid at your death if you die during the income phase the beneficiary becomes the contract owner death of annuitant if the annuitant who is not a contract owner or joint owner dies during the accumulation phase you can name a new annuitant if a new annuitant is not named within  days of the death of the annuitant you will become the annuitant however if the contract owner is a nonnatural person eg a corporation then the death of the annuitant will be treated as the death of the contract owner and a new annuitant may not be named if the annuitant dies after annuity payments have begun the remaining amounts payable if any will be as provided for in the annuity option selected the remaining amounts payable will be paid to the contract owner at least as rapidly as they were being paid at the annuitants death  other information allianz life allianz life insurance company of north america allianz life  hennepin avenue minneapolis

 azl money market fund in july  the us securities and exchange commission adopted certain amendments to the regulations governing money market mutual funds which will change significantly the way that certain money market funds will be required to operate at its meeting on june   the board of trustees of the allianz variable insurance products trust considered the likely effects of the rule changes on the azl money market fund and approved changes proposed by the fund s manager allianz investment management llc to the name and principal investment strategies of the fund as a result of these changes the fund will become a government money market fund and will be called the azl government money market fund as a government money market fund the fund will be permitted subject to the revised regulations to continue to use a stable net asset value  and the fund will not be required to impose fees on shareholder redemptions or to temporarily suspend redemptions in the event that the fund s weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold the board believes that this result is in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders the changes to the fund are expected to be fully implemented by may   prior to the final compliance dates for the new rules however it is anticipated that the fund s subadviser blackrock advisors llc will begin immediately to gradually implement changes to the fund s portfolio in order to provide the most efficient transition as a result it is expected that the fund gradually will allocate a larger percentage of its assets to government securities over time until it reaches its new allocation on or about may  because the yields on government securities generally may be expected to be lower than the yields on comparable nongovernment securities it should be expected that the fund s yield will decrease as more assets are invested in government securities as a result of these changes approved by the board of trustees the fund is no longer subject to the requirement that it invest at least  of its assets in the financial services industry effective on or about may   the name of the fund will be changed to azl government money market fund and the primary investments included in the investment options section of the prospectus is expected to be updated to the following invests at least  of its total assets in cash government securities or repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully investments include us treasury bills notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the us

payments gmib payments beginning on the fifth contract anniversary if you apply the entire contract value to annuity payments we call that a full annuitization and if you apply only part of the contract value to annuity payments we call that a partial annuitization the maximum number of annuitizations you can have at any one time is five because the contract allows partial annuitization it is possible that some portions of the contract are in the accumulation phase and other portions are in the annuity phase at the same time the annuity phase begins on the income date or the first income date if you take any partial annuitizations and ends when all portions of the contract that you apply to annuity payments have ended as indicated in section  the annuity phase  gmib partial annuitizations are based on the gmib value and are not available until the fifth contract anniversary and they are not available if the gmib value is less than the contract value your investment choices include the investment options and any available general account investment choice you cannot invest in more than  investment options at any one time depending upon market conditions you can gain or lose value in the contract based on the investment performance of the investment options the investment options are designed to offer the opportunity for a better return than any available general account investment choice however this is not guaranteed the amount of contract value you are able to accumulate in your contract during the accumulation phase and the amount of any variable traditional annuity payments we make during the annuity phase depend in large part upon the investment performance of any investment options you select  the only general account investment choices available during the accumulation phase are the fixed period accounts fpas you can allocate up to  of any purchase payment to the fpas during the accumulation phase however in some states the fpas may only be available for gav transfers we make if your contract includes the living guarantees in addition we may transfer more than  of the total purchase payments to the fpas beginning on the second contract anniversary in order to support the living guarantees the fpas have account periods ranging from one to ten years only one fpa is available for purchase payments or transfers in each contract year amounts allocated to the fpas earn interest that we declare periodically if you have money invested in the fpas the amount of contract value you are able to accumulate in your contract during the

phase ends the annuity phase if any ends andor if we received a valid claim all applicable death benefit payments have been made for example if you purchased a contract and later take a full withdrawal of the entire contract value both the accumulation phase and the contract end although the annuity phase never began and we did not make any death benefit payments state specific contract restrictions the contract is subject to the law of the state in which it was issued some of the terms of your contract may differ from the terms of a contract delivered in another state because of

a taxable event you should consult with your tax adviser before doing this joint owner nonqualified contracts can be owned by up to two owners upon the death of either joint owner the surviving joint owner becomes the sole primary beneficiary we then treat any other beneficiary designation on record at the time of death as a contingent beneficiary you can change joint owners under the same conditions as described for an owner if a contract has joint owners we generally require the signature of both owners on any forms that are submitted to our service center note partial annuitizations are not available to joint owners there can be only one owner the owner must be the annuitant and we do not allow the owner to add a joint annuitant  annuitant the annuitant is the individual on whose

the annuity date the younger owner automatically becomes the new annuitant but the owner can subsequently name another annuitant designating different persons as owners and annuitants can have important impacts on whether a death benefit is paid and on who would receive it for example if a sole owner dies during the accumulation phase of the contract we pay a death benefit to the beneficiarys if the annuitant is not an owner and heshe dies during the accumulation phase of the contract the owner can name a new annuitant subject to our approval and we do not pay a death benefit

death unless you name an irrevocable beneficiary if a beneficiary predeceases you or you and a beneficiary die simultaneously as defined by applicable state law or regulation that beneficiary s interest in this contract ends unless your beneficiary designation specifies otherwise if there are no surviving beneficiaries or if there is no named beneficiary we pay the death benefit to your estate or the owner if the owner is a nonindividual note for jointly owned contracts the sole primary beneficiary is the surviving joint owner regardless of any other named beneficiaries spousal joint owners may also appoint contingent beneficiaries however joint owners who are not spouses may not appoint contingent beneficiaries if both joint owners who were never spouses die before we pay the

the person selling you the contract who generally earns a commission on each sale you should consult a tax adviser to discuss the potential tax effects before making a  exchange  accumulation unitscomputing the contract value your contract value in the subaccounts separate account value increase and decrease based upon the investment performance of the investment options you choose your contract value is also affected by the charges of the contract any interest you earn on any general account investment choices and any mvas made due to amounts removed from the fpas in order to keep track of your separate account value we use a measurement called an accumulation unit if you request variable traditional annuity payments during the annuity phase of the contract we call this measurement an annuity unit when we receive a purchase payment we credit your contract with accumulation units for any portion of your purchase payment allocated to an investment option at the daily price next determined after receipt of the purchase payment at our service center the daily purchase price is normally determined at the end of each business day and any purchase payment received at or after the end of the current business day receives the next business day s price the purchase payments you allocate to the investment options are actually placed into subaccounts each subaccount invests exclusively in one investment option we determine the number of accumulation units we credit to your contract by dividing the amount of the purchase payment allocated to a subaccount by the value of the corresponding accumulation unit every business day we determine the value of an accumulation unit for each subaccount by multiplying the accumulation unit value for the previous business day by the net investment factor for the current business day we determine the net investment factor by adding declared distributions daily interest dividends long term gains and short term gains for an investment option to its net asset value nav that result is then divided by the nav the end of the prior business day to determine the overall daily performance in the investment option that calculation is then multiplied by one minus the current business day s mortality and expense risk charge and any additional calendar days since the prior business day we calculate the value of each accumulation unit after regular trading on the new york stock exchange closes each business day the value of an accumulation unit may go up or down from business day to business day we calculate your separate account value by multiplying the accumulation unit value in each subaccount by the number of accumulation units for each subaccount and then adding those results together for example the contract value on any contract anniversary reflects the number and value of the accumulation units at the end of the previous business day example on wednesday we receive at our service center an additional purchase payment of  from you before the end of the business day when the new york stock exchange closes on that wednesday we determine that the value of an accumulation unit for the investment option you chose is  we then divide  by  and credit your contract on wednesday night with subaccount accumulation units for the investment option you chose if the  payment had been received at or after the end of the current business day it would have received the next business day s price   the annuity phase you can apply your contract value to regular periodic payments annuity payments a full annuitization occurs when you apply the entire contract value to annuity payments a partial annuitization occurs when you apply only part of your contract value to annuity payments the payee receives the annuity payments you receive tax reporting on the payments whether or not you are the payee we may require proof of the annuitants age before we make any life contingent annuity payment if you misstate the annuitants age or gender the amount payable is the amount that would have been provided at the true age or gender  gmib partial annuitizations are based on the gmib value and are not available until the fifth contract anniversary and they are not available if the gmib value is less than the contract value income date the income date is the date annuity payments gmib payments or traditional annuity payments begin your scheduled income date in your contract is the maximum permitted income date allowed for your contract which is the first day of the calendar month following the later of a the annuitant s th birthday or b the tenth contract anniversary your scheduled income date may be different if the contract is issued to a charitable remainder trust an earlier income date or a withdrawal may be required to satisfy minimum required distribution rules under certain qualified contracts you can make an authorized request for a different income date but any such request is subject to applicable law and our approval the extension available to you may vary depending on the financial professional you purchased your contract through and your state of residence your income date must be the first day of a calendar month and must be at least two years after the issue date some states may require us to allow you to select an earlier income date the income date cannot be later than what is permitted under applicable law to receive the annuity income protection of the gmib your income date must be within  days following a contract anniversary beginning with the fifth contract anniversary and certain other conditions must also be met your election to start annuity payments may involve an mva if any of your contract value is in a fpa on the income date note you must take a full annuitization of your total contract value on the maximum permitted income date if at that time your contract value is greater than zero we base your annuity payments on your contract value if you have not selected an annuity option we make payments under the default option described in the annuity payments discussion of this section upon full annuitization you no longer have a contract value any periodic withdrawal or payments other than annuity payments stop and the death benefit ends in addition if your contract includes the living guarantees the fpas and the guaranteed withdrawal benefit are no longer available to you and you no longer receive any true ups traditional annuity payments annuity payments offer a guaranteed income stream with certain tax advantages and are designed for owners who are not concerned with continued access to contract value you can request traditional annuity payments under annuity options  as a variable payout a fixed payout or a combination of both we base annuity payments on your contract value under a fixed payout all of the annuity payments are the same dollar amount equal installments except as provided under annuity option  guaranteed fixed traditional annuity payments are based on an interest rate and mortality table specified in your contract the payout rates for fixed traditional annuity payments provided by your contract are guaranteed and in no event do we use lower fixed payout rates to calculate your fixed traditional annuity payments however we may use higher fixed payout rates to calculate fixed traditional annuity payments than the guaranteed rates provided by your contract  view more similar documents variable annuity allianz rewards prospectus sign up to view your

decreased or in those cases where the number of investment options is being reduced continue to offer a significant number of alternative investment options specifically the number of investment options is currently expected to range in number from  to  after the substitutions versus  to  before the substitutions  at the close of business on the day of the substitution the “substitution date” insurance company applicants will each redeem shares of the replaced funds held by their separate accounts in kind and apply the proceeds of such redemptions to the purchase shares of the corresponding replacement funds thus after the substitutions each subaccount of the separate accounts previously holding shares of a replaced fund will hold shares of the corresponding replacement fund  redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that redemption of replaced fund shares and purchase of replacement fund shares will both occur at the price for such shares computed as of the close of business on the substitution date in a manner consistent with rule c under the  act as a result the full net asset value of the replaced fund shares held by the separate accounts will be reflected in the contractowners contract values following the substitutions without reduction for brokerage or other such fees or charges all expenses incurred in connection with the substitutions including legal accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage start printed page commissions will be paid by insurance company applicants or the manager of the replacement funds accordingly contract value attributable to contractowners then invested in the replaced funds will remain fully invested at all times and the substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contractowners contract value death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the applicable separate account  affected contractowners will not incur any fees or charges in connection with the substitutions so that the net asset value of redeemed shares of the replaced funds held by the separate accounts will be reflected in the contractowners contract values following the substitutions moreover neither the obligations of the respective insurance company applicants under the contracts nor the rights of contractowners will be altered in any way by the substitutions the substitutions will not impose any tax liability or have any adverse tax consequences on contractowners the substitutions will not cause contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing owners of contracts to be greater after the substitutions than they were before the substitutions for a period of at least  days following the substitutions insurance company applicants will not exercise any right it may have under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers except pursuant to any investment option allocation restrictions under the contracts  from the date that notice of the substitutions was provided to affected contractowners by means of a prospectus supplement the “presubstitution supplement” through the date  days after the substitution the “free transfer period” the respective insurance company applicants will allow the affected contractowners to make one transfer of contract value held in each subaccount investing in the replaced funds before the substitutions or replacement fund after the substitutions to one or more investment options available pursuant to the contracts without charge and without assessing transfer fees such a transfer also will not be counted as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge  under the manager of managers order subject to the approval of the board of trustees of the vip trust azim may retain one or more subadvisers for any fund of the vip trust without the approval of shareholders of the fund however after the substitution date insurance company applicants represent that azim will not retain any new subadviser for the azl sp  index fund and the azl small cap stock index fund or otherwise rely on the manager of managers order in connection with azl sp  index fund and the azl small cap stock index fund without first obtaining shareholder approval of either  the new subadviser or  the funds ability to rely on the manager of managers order  notice of the substitutions and free transfer period has been given to all affected contractowners by means of the presubstitution supplement for each of the contracts stating that applicants have filed the application and seek approval of the substitutions the presubstitution supplement sets forth the anticipated substitution date and advises affected contractowners that contract values allocated to subaccounts investing in shares of the replaced funds will be transferred to subaccounts investing in shares of the replacement funds without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge on the substitution date the presubstitution supplement states that during the free transfer period affected contractowners may make one transfer of contract value from each subaccount investing in a replaced fund before the substitutions or a replacement fund after the substitutions to one or more other subaccounts subject to any investment option allocation restrictions under their contract without charge and without the transfer counting against any limitations on transfers further prior to the substitutions all affected contractowners will receive a copy of the most recent prospectus for the replacement funds  within five days following the substitutions insurance company applicants will send a written notice to affected contractowners stating that the substitutions were carried out and reiterating the information set forth in the presubstitution supplement  for those who were contractowners on the date of the proposed substitutions insurance company applicants will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the  months following the substitution date those contractowners whose subaccount invests in any replacement fund such that the sum of such replacement funds a operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements net of any acquired fund fees and expenses and b assetbased fees and charges for the contracts for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the corresponding replaced funds operating expenses taking into account any fee waiver or expense reimbursement and subaccount expenses for the fiscal year ended december   thereafter expenses for the replacement funds will vary from year to year and may exceed those of the corresponding replaced funds applicants legal analysis  applicants represent that section c of the  act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission approves the substitution applicants note that the commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  applicants note the legislative history makes clear that congress intended section c of the  act to provide the commission scrutiny of proposed substitutions that could otherwise in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring either a loss of the sales load deducted from initial purchase payments an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both  applicants assert that section c of the  act would not appear to have been designed to prohibit transactions like the substitutions in which a number of customer protections are provided including the fact that the applicable unit investment trusts the separate accounts offer in excess of  different investment options  applicants claim that the purposes terms and conditions of the substitutions are consistent with the principles and purposes of section c of the  act and do not entail any of the abuses that section c of the  act is designed to prevent contractowners will not be assessed charges in connection with the substitutions and their annual fund net total operating expenses are expected to remain the same or decrease in addition to the extent a contractowner does not wish to participate in the start printed page substitutions he or she is free to make one transfer to any other option available under the relevant contract at any time prior to the date of the substitutions or during the day period following the date of the substitutions without any transfer fee and without that transfer counting as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge moreover the contracts have features that applicants believe provide adequate protection to contractowners these features include  a significant number of different investment options  investment options that are reasonably diversified  investment options that are reasonably seasoned  reasonable transferability between investment options  investment choices that include an option that is intended to reduce or eliminate fluctuation of principal and  reasonable liquidity in the form of free partial withdrawal rights  in addition contractowners will be substituted into replacement funds whose investment objectives principal investment policies and risks applicants believe will be substantially similar or virtually identical to those of the corresponding replaced funds with net total operating expenses that are anticipated to be equal to or less than those of their corresponding replaced funds like the replaced funds which are not assessed a b fee their corresponding replacement funds will not be assessed a b fee  in addition to substantially similar or virtually identical investment objectives principal investment policies and risks as well as anticipated equal or lower net total operating expenses applicants maintain that the types of investment advisory and administrative services that will be provided to the replacement funds by their subadvisers will be comparable to the types of investment advisory and administrative services currently provided to the replaced funds by their respective investment advisers contractowners who become beneficial owners of the replacement funds as a result of the proposed substitutions will enjoy continuity of their asset manager these replacement funds will be managed by azim but the asset management activity will be handled by the subadviser that currently manages the corresponding replaced fund  moreover because the replacement funds operate pursuant to the manager of managers order applicants believe that the proposed substitutions will provide protection to contractowners by giving azim the flexibility to change the subadvisers of the replacement funds should such a change become warranted or advisable thus applicants will provide contractowners with investment vehicles following the substitutions that will be substantially similar to those offered prior to the substitutions  in further support of their contention that the substitutions do not present the type of costly forced redemption or other harms that section c of the  act was intended to guard against and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the  act applicants note that the substitutions will be subject to the following terms and conditions  a contractowner may request that his or her contract value be reallocated to another investment option subject to any investment option allocation restrictions under their contract at any time during the free transfer period without charge the free transfer period provides sufficient time for contractowners to reconsider their investment options  the substitutions will be at net asset value of the respective shares without the imposition of any transfer brokerage or similar charge  neither the contractowners the replaced funds nor the replacement funds will bear any costs of the substitutions and all legal accounting and transactional costs and any brokerage or other costs incurred in the substitutions will be paid by insurance company applicants or the managers to the replacement funds and accordingly the substitutions will have no impact on the contractowners contract values  the substitutions will in no way alter the contractual obligations of insurance company applicants or the rights and privileges of contractowners under the contracts and  the substitutions will in no way alter the tax benefits to contractowners  applicants request an order of the commission pursuant to section c of the  act approving the substitutions on the terms set forth in this application applicants believe for all of the reasons stated above that each substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  section  applicants also request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit insurance company applicants to carry out the substitutions by redeeming shares of the replaced funds in kind and using the proceeds to purchase shares of the replacement funds  section a of the  act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of an affiliated person acting as principal from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company section a of the  act prohibits any of the persons described above acting as principal from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company section a of the  act defines the term “affiliated person” of another person in relevant part as a any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote five per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of such other person b any person five per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with power to vote by such other person c any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person d any officer director partner copartner or employee of such other person e if such other person is an investment company any investment adviser thereof or any member of an advisory board thereof and f if such other person is an unincorporated investment company not having a board of directors the depositor thereof  applicants may be considered affiliates of each of the replacement funds based upon the definition of “affiliated person” in section a of the  act shares of the funds of the vip trust are held solely by separate accounts because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company insurance company applicants and their affiliates collectively own of record all of the shares of the funds of the vip trust including the replacement funds further azim an affiliated person of the vip trust by virtue of section a e of the  act is a wholly owned subsidiary of allianz life for these reasons the vip trust and the replacement funds are arguably under the control of insurance company applicants notwithstanding the fact that contractowners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if the vip trust and the replacement funds are under the control of insurance company applicants then insurance company applicants or any person controlling start printed page insurance company applicants or any person under common control with insurance company applicants is an affiliated person of the vip trust and the replacement funds similarly if the vip trust and the replacement funds are under the control of insurance company applicants then the vip trust and the replacement funds are affiliated persons of insurance company applicants and of any persons that control insurance company applicants or are under common control with insurance company applicants at the close of business on the substitution date insurance company applicants will redeem shares of the replaced funds either in kind or in cash and use the proceeds of such redemptions to purchase shares of the corresponding replacement funds with each subaccount of the applicable separate account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the replaced funds in the applicable replacement funds thus the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the replaced funds to insurance company applicants immediately thereafter insurance company applicants would purchase shares of the replacement funds with the portfolio securities received from the replaced funds this aspect of the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more sales by insurance company applicants of securities or other property to the replacement funds accordingly this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a of the  act accordingly section  applicants seek relief from section a of the  act for the inkind purchases and sales of the replacement fund shares  section  applicants assert that any inkind redemptions and purchases for purposes of the substitutions will be effected in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the replacement funds subject to the oversight of azim the subadvisers of each of the replacement funds will review the securities holdings of their corresponding replaced fund and determine which of the replaced fund holdings would be suitable investments for the corresponding replacement fund in the overall context of that replacement funds investment objective and policies and consistent with their management of the replacement fund and will accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction section  applicants submit that these portfolio securities will be of the type and quality that the replacement funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash  section  applicants state that any securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the replacement funds to effect the contemplated inkind purchases of shares will be valued in accordance with the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming and purchasing portfolios the redeeming and purchasing values will be the same consistent with rule ad under the  act no brokerage commissions fees or other remuneration will be paid by the replaced funds or the replacement funds in connection with the inkind transactions if azim declines to accept particular portfolio securities of any of the replaced funds for purchase of inkind shares of any of the replacement funds those positions will be liquidated by the applicable replaced fund and shares of the corresponding replacement fund will be purchased with cash  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a of the  act if the evidence establishes that  the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned  the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records found under the  act and  the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the  act  section  applicants submit that the terms of the substitutions including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a under the  act the use of inkind transactions will not cause contractowner interests to be diluted the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the  act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contractowners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts contractowners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though they may not rely on rule a under the  act section  applicants submit that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons  the board of the vip trust has adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a under the  act the “a procedures” pursuant to which the replacement funds may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates section  applicants will carry out the proposed inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and the a procedures except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer to each replacement fund the same degree of protection from overreaching that rule a provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular insurance company applicants or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective registration statement and as required by rule c under the  act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed transactions the transactions will be reviewed by the chief compliance officer of the vip trust or his agents and will be reported to the vip trusts board of trustees in the same manner as any other a transaction by any of the replacement funds would be reported  section  applicants also submit that the inkind portfolio security transactions are consistent with the policies of the replacement funds and the vip trust as recited in the current registration statements and reports
