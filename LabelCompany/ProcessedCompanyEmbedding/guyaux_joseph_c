inc focusing on the customer is no risk at all  spring   pitt business magazine university of pittsburgh pitt business go home  about  pitt business magazine  joseph c guyaux focusing on the customer is no risk at all for financial institutions the line between winning and losing is sharply drawn on risk the market upheaval on wall street was accelerated by firms betting heavily on what turned out to be highrisk assets pnc financial services group was not one of those banks joseph c guyaux mba  had a front row seat to the action guyaux in his former role as president of pnc and head of retail banking grew the retail core that safely anchored pnc when rough seas swept the market he visited campus in september as the featured speaker of the  thought leaders in business speakers forum when he discussed pncs strategy for how to excel during tough times a plan that begins and ends with the customer anthropology and the future of banking imagine adding a half million new customers but producing less revenue that is whats happening to the retail business at pnc like all banks historically low interest rates are eating away the bottom line deposits are worth less in this environment pnc has other challenges too there is worrisome new competition from companies outside the banking sphere slow job growth is holding back the us economy financial regulatory reform is a big unknown so what makes guyaux relentlessly confident about pncs future prospects he believes pnc is well positioned for growth by virtue of the fact that it builds everything around its customers under guyauxs leadership pnc has rolled out new products targeting the younger demographic such as virtual wallet an online tool that integrates three accounts — titled spend reserve and growth — with industryleading personal finance tools the success of this segment led pnc to add features to virtual wallet aimed at expanding its appeal to older techsavvy customers the pathway out is to focus on customers and to think about our guiding principles reciprocity transparency and choice thats the way out while we manage our costs while we manage our capital guyaux told a pitt business audience of students and alumni gathered in the william pitt union for his thought leaders presentation the thought leaders forum made possible by the support of alumni shekar narasimhan mba  and ed hurley mba  exposes students to leading business thinkers from a variety of industries the speakers share executivelevel insight into how to lead in todays complex global economy often times innovation is a driving force of effective leadership since knowing what customers want isnt easy pnc leaves nothing to chance it hired a firm that employs amongst others anthropologists and social behaviorists the firm conducted field research that became the basis for many features of the virtual wallet program and its corresponding mobile applications for the iphone ipod touch and android devices the anthropologists and behavioral scientists went and observed how people who are gen y live their lives and how they manage their money what we got from that was our gen y customers dont think about checking accounts and savings accounts what they said was ive got money i spend ive got money i save and ive got money in reserve and how do you fi t into my life to make it easy  guyaux said pnc invests in traditional advertising channels such as television print media and billboards but increasingly the company focuses on social media — and its potential for providing hyperspecific information about customer habits where do you think most of our improvement ideas come from now guyaux asked the audience from listening to our customers on twitter and our blog the day after we rolled out our check deposit app for the iphone i went onto twitter half the twitter comments were this is great i cant believe it this bank gets it the other half were whats up with this no droid when are you going to update this it doesnt do me any good cyclical or secular the question going forward guyaux joined pnc bank in  in march  he was appointed senior vice chairman and chief risk officer in this role he oversees pncs enterprisewide risk management program including operating compliance credit and market risk prior to that guyaux led pncs consumer businesses business banking brokerage and residential mortgage business in the late s guyaux experienced a crossroads moment popular wisdom was that retail branches were dying many banks viewed feebased services such as treasury management or investments as growth engines and were willing to siphon retails cash to support them guyaux did not agree with that future he spent the first  years of his career in branches to him their value was clear so as competitors backed off retail banking guyaux went the other way he pushed pnc to renew its retail focus and implemented strategies that increased revenues and improved customer and employee satisfaction ultimately its retail core gave pnc a layer of body armor that other banks didnt have during the wall street crisis and the extreme downturn even so guyaux warns of a tipping point in terms of banks free services fifty years ago customers only had access to bank branches now they have automated teller machines atm call centers internet access and mobile access pnc customers arent paying extra for these services instead of shuttering branches pnc is taking advantage of selfservice trends giving customers tools to make their lives easier mobile banking transactions cost us onetenth of what it costs if customers went into a branch atm check imaging is a lower cost also guyaux said guyaux says hed like to see his branches do a better job of demonstrating products for customers for example walking out to the atm and showing them how to deposit a check remotely i hate to say this but most banks — ours included — wait for the customers to discover it by themselves apple doesnt do that you walk in and they start telling you what you might be interested in guyaux said from brown to the pipeline gang raised in tarentum a bluecollar town northeast of pittsburgh guyaux was the first in his family to go to college he earned a scholarship to brown university one summer guyaux lined up a summer internship in finance but his father insisted that guyaux work for the upper allegheny joint sanitary authoritys pipeline gang cleaning out riverfront sewers instead it was work there or move out guyaux recalled my father said i dont know what youre doing up there at brown but i want to make sure you know what you could be doing if you mess it up guyaux laughs about it now but the labor was hot dirty physical work not that the banking climate is much more hospitable we are going to face increased compliance efforts and were going to comply with them guyaux said whatever the challenges pittsburghbased pnc marches on it doubled its size by purchasing national city bank and recently finalized the integration of royal bank of canada usa pnc now employs more than  people it operates branches in  states serving more than  million customers it was astonishing to me that we were able to acquire national city bank guyaux said national city bank was bigger than pnc so we acquired a bank that was bigger than us and only had to pay about  percent of our value to get it and the reason was they didnt manage risk both liquidity risk and credit risk pnc emerged from the banking crisis stronger because it avoided the pitfalls that stuck other banks with a glut of toxic assets it did send a message home to us at pnc that said you do get rewarded for managing your risk well sometimes it just takes longer if there had never been a recession that might never have happened but if you believe that economies go up and down in varying degrees and varying lengths of prosperity and recession then you need to be managing your risk guyaux said hear guyauxs thought leaders presentation mp pitt business magazine  spring  in this issue in sports in business parallels abound school of hard knocks the legacy that
