late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help when i first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me i even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them i was able to get  apr until the next year and they also had low transfer rates now that i have been with the company for a long time there is no way i would switch i have also talked to some of my family and friends joining citi and switching from the credit cards that they had they are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now they have also used citi for loans and also personal banking thank you citi reply thank you your comment has been

wont do it reply thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review   submit comment  reply by comparecards  jan   hi marty it is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank the reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the citi simplicity is because the att access more credit card is issued by citibank as well but  apr is very high so i would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest two cards to consider that arent issued by citibank would be the chase slate which offers  months with  apr and no balance transfer fee or the discover it which has  months with  apr thank you your comment has been submitted and is
