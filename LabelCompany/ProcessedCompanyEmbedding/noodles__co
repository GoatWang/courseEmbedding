from the reviews i was pleasantly surprised the woman who took my order was helpful everything is made to order and she took the time to explain how i might customize my order to fit my needs when i asked about alcoholic beverages she listed them for me and let me know what is most commonly ordered it was not immediately clear to me where to go for silverware and soft drinks after we ordered the store itself is very clean there are lots of booths and tables some tucked away in the back for more privacy we ordered the small pad thai and an order of chicken dumplings i was surprised at the quantity of pad thai offered for an  dish the best part for me was the dumplings though they were really good and the sauce they were served with was perfect im not usually a fan of restaurants that think they know what i will like in a dipping sauce but this one was good with just a hint of spice my husband and i split the noodles and dumplings between us and left satisfied i will go back there are several more noodle dishes i want to try and i also want some more of those dumplings theres better places to eat in this plaza  for pastas that you can make better at home got the penne rosa with chicken breasts without the chicken probably wouldnt have finished it generous portions though the pasta was alright definitely not coming back the portion sizes were extremely small the large looked like it couldve been a small for two large bowls and drinks it was  which was not worth it i waited in line a few minutes until the guy in the front finally turned his back around to take our order it wasnt too busy when we got there there was one customer there and then about four more after we showed up i got the pasta that was featured on the cardboard sign on the counter it was a little too oily for me first time here so thought id give it a try since they offered a variety had the spicy korean noodles it was oversauced and on the salty side i poured out the extra sauce and there was still plenty left in the bowl couldnt finish even the small bowl because it was too salty kids mac and cheese meal was a good option for my son but i wouldnt come back here  stars for offering variety otherwise it would have been  star my hubby and my daughter superliked in here we loved trying all their offers and varieties of food we loved noodles feeling like weve travelled the world by eating different kind and taste hahahaha not so authentic but still ok hopefully they can offer laksa from malaysia amd singapore the soonest thank you for making us full today will definitely coming back soon noodles noodles  more noodles if you and your friends are in the mood for noodles but not sure specifically what type this is the spot this was my first time to a noodles  company and i really liked the variety from penne rosa tomatobased cream sauce to pad thai to steak stroganoff there is something on the menu for anyones taste during my first visit i tried the penne rosa with parmesancrusted chicken breast per staff recommendation it was prepared in under  minutes almost took me longer to go fill my cup up with root beer the food was tasty and filled me up perfectly before returning back to work if im in the mood for noodles but unsure what type initiallyill stop back at noodles  company i had japanese noodle and korean noodle the japanese noodle was tasty but the only think i dont like was they put too much sauce in korean noodle that was why it made the noodle salty overall good noodle and nice place will definitely come back my husband and i both had the japanese pan noodles with steak an extra the noodle texture and caramelized sauce were good but the serving contained very little other than noodles ie very few vegetables high calorie counts high sodium with little nutritional value started being disappointed when we couldnt place an online order once we arrived at the location we were overwhelmed at the choices we chose a few options and waited for our to go order some of the dishes pad thai and mac n cheese were just okay our other dishes were pretty good the price was good compared to amount of food we got they have options for everyone we will be going back came in for lunch the other day i had the penne rosa with a side salad and soup it was delicious the place was well managed and clean the helpful cashier joseph also let me know they have noodles rewards ill be back for sure points their portion has always been inconsistent one day my small japanese noodle order can feed  adults while another day it was barely enough for a toddler theres nothing authentictasting about any of the dishes since it tastes nothing like the foods from that particular country thats like claiming taco bell is authentic mexican food and panda express is authentic chinese food dishes that ive had here japanese noodle  edible korean noodle  spicy and thats about all i can say about the dish mac  cheese  offensive beef stroganoff  passable chicken adobo  waste of money on the bright side the staff are friendly and helpful we are currently addicted to this place a picture says a thousand words right ill attach one from last nights feast the meatballs omg yum tomato soup is delicious korean spicy noodles are killer burger mac and cheese was so good trust us check this place out decided on this place by doing the ole eenie meenie mienie moe method in the new plaza we ordered potstickers spicy korean noodles and the japanese pan noodles very tasty definitely coming here again especially since my  yr old keeps telling me oh i like this this is good clean friendly new and so he so tasty great job i thought id try this place since its new and different i looked at the menu and asked the cashier what was popular she suggested the top row so i opted for the japanese pan noodles and chose the small bowl she asked what meat i wanted with it and immediately offered the steak goes well with it so i agreed i also ordered for my son the kids meal of spaghetti meatballs with two side options of apples and kids crispy which is a small block of rice krispies treat when she rang it all up i was surprised that it was about  which includes both our meals and a milk i thought ok not bad as far as price so we went to sit down and as looked at the receipt i was charged  for the steak you know it would have been nice to have been told there was an extra charge for the meat since i wasnt aware there was when we received our meals i thought how small the serving was but then i did order a small right and i didnt think there was enough meat to justify the  i would have to say my noodles were okay the flavor was fine but i thought the udon was chewy and it really wasnt that warm my sons spaghetti wasnt that warm either but he ate some of it okay ill come back and try it again since i did fill out the online survey which i shared in part the same here on yelp and received a validation code to redeem but for what it it wasnt specified overall a good experience everyone enjoyed their dishes and we had several with  of us most notable was a small spicy penne rosa w parm chicken  less notable was the pad thai which was good but flavor was quite light in my opinion also we had one small and one regular ordered and bows were different sizes but content looked very close to same i will bring a scale when i return to this place to validate their sizes have some significance to justify the  price difference also notable was the side of thai curry vegetables  which was very good w the japanese pan noodles i think it would pair a small pad thai well and to the overall flavor i really dont like to leave poor reviews im a vegetarian and im always so excited when a business offers options such as no meat or even tofu today i ordered the korean noodles with no meat online when i came to pick up my order a really nice man was bagging my order and noticed there was meat in it without me saying anything he apologized and i watched as he asked the cook to make a fresh one he even gave me a coupon for a free bowl i was really impressed with his service when i got home i noticed that the cook did not actually remake the order they just took most of the beef out i still had multiple chunks of beef that was really disappointing i stayed and waited around while they made me a fresh bowl which wasnt fresh at all the gentleman that helped me today was awesome but i hope this can be a teaching moment for the cooks im not sure if i would go back im sorry im in love with noodles and company im from minnesota and its a much more popular chain there i was thrilled when i found out there was a noodles close to me but then it shut down i think due to inconsistent experiences at that location so that was a bummer ive been to this location twice now with no issues yay and it always hits the spot i get the penne rosa with feta a spicy delicious sauce with penne pasta my boyfriend gets the wisconsin mac n cheese which is different from most places where they oversaturate everything with too much cheese we came here the other day with the family to give it a try everybody was very happy to find something on the menu that they liked and to give it a try we placed our orders i was within about  to  minutes are orders were at our table refillable drinks and very big bowls they have good stuff on the menu so it will be hard to choose the only complaint we have is finding tables to sit and have an enjoyable meal not much to say besides it was very lackluster had the spicy korean noodles and the japanese pan noodles the spicy korean noodles had some flavor and a good amount of spice the japanese pan noodles were flavorless there were bits of broccoli in the dish but they were pretty much raw and didnt go at all with the cooked noodles the highlight of the meal were the korean meatballs nothing horrible about this place just wasnt impressed also for the cost i could have made  times as much food at home clean place and friendly workers our favorites are the spaghetti meatballs and japanese pan noodles chicken noodle soup is really good but it says its seasonal now  noodles  company unclaimed
