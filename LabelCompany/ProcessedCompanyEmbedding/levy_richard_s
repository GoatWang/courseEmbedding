contributions too on the phenomenon in the arab world both before and after the foundation of israel contributors grapple with the use and abuse of the term antisemitism which was first coined in the midnineteenth century but which has since gathered a range of obscure connotations and confusingly different definitions often applied retrospectively to historically distant periods and vastly dissimilar phenomena of course as this book shows hostility to jews dates to biblical periods but the nature of that hostility and the many purposes to which it has been put have varied over time and often been mixed with admiration a situation which continues in the twentyfirst century antisemitism  a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution book  editions published between  and  in
