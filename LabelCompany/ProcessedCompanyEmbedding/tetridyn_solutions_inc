engineering methodologies strategic planning and system integration to develop radiofrequency identification products to address location tracking issues in the healthcare industry including issues surrounding patient care optimization of business processes for healthcare providers improved reporting of incidents and increased revenues for provided services the condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly owned subsidiary an idaho corporation also named tetridyn solutions inc intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in the opinion of management our financial statements reflect all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature necessary for presentation of financial statements for interim periods in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and with the instructions to form q in article  of sec regulation sx as used in this report the terms “we” “us” and “our” mean tetridyn solutions inc and its subsidiary unless the context indicates otherwise we condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our annual audited financial statements which we prepared in accordance with gaap our interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march   and june   the results of the interim period are not indicative of the results expected for the year ended december   in preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period note  going concern the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern as reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements we had a net loss of  and used  of cash in operating activities for the nine months ended september   we had a working capital deficiency and a stockholders’ deficit of  as of september   these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to increase sales and obtain external funding for our product development the financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty note  income taxes no income tax expense was recognized for the three and ninemonth periods ended september   and  and the threemonth period ended september   due to net losses being incurred in these periods we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and various states for the prior three years there has not been a change in our unrecognized tax positions since december   and we do not believe there will be any material changes in our unrecognized tax positions over the next  months our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense we do not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits and no interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits was recognized during the nine months ended september            our recent equity raises and past restructuring events have resulted in the occurrence of a triggering event as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended which could limit the use of the our net operating loss carryforwards we have yet to undertake a study to quantify any limitations on their use note  fair value of financial instruments the accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs where available the following summarizes the three levels of inputs required as well as the assets and liabilities that we value using those levels of inputs ●    level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities ●    level   observable inputs other than those included in level  for example quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets ●    level   unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability a review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities we did not have any significant nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that would be recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of september   nor did we have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in the first nine months of  note  net loss per common share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding we recorded a net loss for each of the three and ninemonth periods ended september   and  so there are no diluted earnings per share calculated for those periods basic and diluted earnings per share were essentially the same for all periods presented as of both september   and   outstanding common share equivalents for granted stock warrants were antidilutive and not used in the calculation of diluted net loss per share additionally as of september   and   and  respectively of common share equivalents for convertible note payables were antidilutive and not used in the calculation of diluted net loss per share note  recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board issued asu  statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments historically there has been a diversity in practice in how certain cash receiptspayments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under topic  the purpose of the update is to reduce the existing diversity in practice by clarifying the presentation of certain types of transactions the amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we note that this guidance applies to our reporting requirements and will implement the new guidance accordingly          we have reviewed all other recently issued but not yet adopted accounting standards in order to determine their effects if any on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows based on that review we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations note  accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of june   we had  included in our accounts payable which was related to balances due for multiple revolving credit cards under the name of our former chief executive officer now deceased these amounts represent advances to us from funds borrowed on credit cards in the name of this officer as an accommodation to us at a time when we were unable to obtain advances on our own credit upon his death these obligations became debts of his estate previously we had agreed to carry these as liabilities on our financial statements until such time as the statute of limitations for collection by the credit card companies expired subsequent to september   we were notified by the executor of our former officer’s estate who is also one of our former directors that the estate would not pursue any future repayment by us accordingly we have removed these obligations from our balance sheet since our former director is one of our affiliates the removal of the obligations resulted in an increase in our additional paidin capital in addition as of june   we also had  included in our accounts payable that was related to balances due for services rendered by the same former director subsequent to september  this amount was also forgiven by our former director resulting in a further increase in our additional paidin capital as of september   we had  in accounts payable the majority of which is

liquidity requirements the continued growth of the software and information technology it services industries the success of our product development marketing and sales activities vigorous competition in the software industry dependence on existing management leverage and debt service including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates domestic or global economic conditions the inherent uncertainty and costs of prolonged arbitration or litigation and changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws overview we optimize business and it processes by using systems engineering methodologies strategic development and integration to add efficiency and value to our customers’ business processes and to help our customers identify critical success factors in their business we have recently focused on business it solutions to the healthcare industry we may seek to expand our service offerings into selected other professional industries as those markets develop and as we develop new applications for our integrated system of radio frequency identification and software solutions for tracking management and diagnostic systems          as we continue development of our proprietary concepts and identify specific commercialization opportunities we will focus on those product markets for which we might be able to get external funding through joint venture agreements strategic partnerships or other direct investments we also consider opportunities in other business lines that may allow us to increase our value revenue we have only generated nominal revenue during the periods covered by this report as our activities consist principally of testing our products description of expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for accounting administration finance human resources and information systems and stock compensation costs professional fees expenses consist primarily of fees related to legal outside accounting auditing and investor relations services results of operations comparison of three months ended september   and  revenues and cost of revenue our revenue of  for the three months ended september   and  for the three months ended september   was not material operating expenses general and administrative expenses were  for the three months ended september   compared to  for the three months ended september   an increase of  the increase is due primarily to secrelated compliance and filing fees professional fees expenses were  for the three months ended september   compared to  for the three months ended september   a decrease of  for the threemonth periods during the third quarter of  we incurred significant costs for legal and accounting fees related to our  proposed merger later abandoned and filing pastdue periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission interest expense was  for the three months ended september   compared to  for the three

expense the debt discount was fully amortized in periods prior to the third quarter of  comparison of nine months ended september   and  revenues and cost of revenue our revenue of  for the nine months ended september   and  for the nine months ended september   was not material          operating expenses general and administrative expenses were  for the nine months ended september   compared to  for the nine months ended september   an increase of  compared to the earlier period the increase is primarily due to stock compensation costs of  in  professional fees expenses were  for the nine months ended september   compared to  for the nine months ended september   a decrease of  the decrease in our professional fees expenses reflects higher legal fees that were associated with investment and acquisition negotiations in  interest expense was  for the nine months ended september   compared to  for the nine months ended september   a decrease of  the change in interest expense was due to the amortization of debt discount in the prior year compared to the current year liquidity and capital resources at september   we had  of cash compared to  of cash at december   our stockholders’ deficit was  at september   our operations used net cash of  during the nine months ended september   compared to net cash used of  during the nine months ended september   the decrease in cash used was primarily the result of lower professional fees in  financing activities provided cash of  for our operations during the nine months ended september   primarily due to a loan from a related party reflecting our dependence on external financing as of june   we had  included in our accounts payable which was related to balances due for multiple revolving credit cards under the name of our former chief executive officer now deceased these amounts represent advances to us from funds borrowed on credit cards in the name of this officer as an accommodation to us at a time when we were unable to obtain advances on our own credit upon his death these obligations became debts of his estate previously we had agreed to carry these as liabilities on our financial statements until

services rendered by the same former director subsequent to september  this amount was also forgiven by our former director resulting in a further increase in our additional paidin capital we are focusing our efforts on completing testing of our product so that we can complete product development to commence sales to generate revenue while we explore external funding alternatives as our current cash is insufficient to fund operations for the next  months our efforts to advance product commercialization is constrained by our lack of capital we expect that new sales would enable us to begin our payments on indebtedness and support the development of other products although our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we believe that increased revenues could be sufficient for our it business solutions segment to continue as a going concern however in order to expand our product offerings we expect that we will require additional investments and sales we have no significant contractual obligations or commercial commitments not reflected on our balance sheet as of this date          critical accounting policies a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note  of our consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made we believe the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide financial statement users with useful reliable and timely information about our earnings results financial condition and cash flows the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements our management reviews these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our financial statements item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officer whom we refer to in this periodic report as our certifying officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our management evaluated with the participation of our certifying officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae under the exchange act as of september   pursuant to rule ab under the exchange act based upon that evaluation our certifying officer concluded that as of september   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance as of september   because certain deficiencies involving internal controls constituted material weaknesses as discussed below the material weaknesses identified did not result in the restatement of any previously reported financial statements or any other related financial disclosure and management does not believe that the material weaknesses had any effect on the accuracy of our financial statements for the current reporting period limitations on effectiveness of controls a system of controls however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the system will meet its objectives the design of a control system is based in part upon the benefits of the control system relative to its costs control systems can be circumvente d by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control in addition over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate in addition the design of any control system is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events          management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control of over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the exchange act we have assessed the effectiveness of those internal controls as of september   using the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” internal control—integrated framework  as a basis for our assessment because of inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance respecting financial statement preparation and presentation further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs a material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects our ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected based on our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of september   as of september   management identified the following material weaknesses ●    control environment —we did not maintain an effective control environment for internal control over financial reporting ●    segregation of duties —as a result of limited resources and staff we did not maintain proper segregation of incompatible duties the effect of the lack of segregation of duties potentially affects multiple processes and procedures ●    entity level controls —we failed to maintain certain entitylevel controls as defined by the framework issued by coso specifically our lack of staff does not allow us to effectively maintain a sufficient number of adequately trained personnel necessary to anticipate and identify risks critical to financial reporting there is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused or at least not be detected in a timely manner due to lack of adequate staff with such expertise ●    access to cash —one executive had the ability to transfer from our bank accounts these weaknesses are continuing management and the board of directors are aware of these weaknesses that result because of limited resources and staff management has begun the process of formally documenting our key processes as a starting point for improved internal control over financial reporting efforts to fully implement the processes we have designed have been put on hold due to limited resources but we anticipate a renewed focus on this effort in the near future due to our limited financial and managerial resources we cannot assure when we will be able to implement effective internal controls over financial reporting changes in internal control over financial reporting there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended september    that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting          part ii–other information item  defaults on securities as of september   a loan from one
