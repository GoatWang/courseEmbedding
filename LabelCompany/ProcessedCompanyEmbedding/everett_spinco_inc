addition nongaap net earnings from continuing operations nongaap net loss earnings from discontinued operations nongaap diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations and nongaap diluted

these nongaap financial measures for purposes of evaluating hewlett packard enterprise’s historical and prospective financial performance as well as hewlett packard enterprise’s performance relative to its competitors hewlett packard enterprise’s management also uses these nongaap measures to further its own understanding of hewlett packard enterprise’s segment operating performance hewlett packard enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these nongaap financial measures allows hewlett packard enterprise’s management to better understand hewlett packard enterprise’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of hewlett packard enterprise’s segments as hewlett packard enterprise’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results more specifically hewlett packard enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons hewlett packard enterprise recorded a gain on the sale of its assets and liabilities identified as part of the hc and mphasis transactions during fiscal  hewlett packard enterprise excludes these gains for purposes of calculating these nongaap measures because it believes that these onetime gains do not reflect the company’s ongoing operational performance thereby facilitating a more meaningful evaluation of hewlett packard enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to hewlett packard enterprise’s operating performance in other periodshewlett packard enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets those charges are included in hewlett packard enterprise’s gaap earnings from operations operating margin net loss earnings and diluted net loss earnings per share such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of hewlett packard enterprise’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges consequently hewlett packard enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these nongaap measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of hewlett packard enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to hewlett packard enterprise’s operating performance in other periodsrestructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to i employee termination costs and benefits ii costs to vacate duplicative facilities and iii an accelerated employee stock compensation program hewlett packard enterprise excludes these restructuring costs and any reversals of charges recorded in prior periods for purposes of calculating these nongaap measures because it believes that these historical costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of hewlett packard enterprise’s current operating performance or comparisons to hewlett packard enterprise’s operating performance in other periodsseparation costs are expenses associated with hpi’s formerly known as “hewlettpackard company” or “hp co” separation into two independent publiclytraded companies and the spinoff and merger transactions of the enterprise services business with csc everett transaction and the software business with micro focus the charges are primarily related to thirdparty consulting contractor fees
