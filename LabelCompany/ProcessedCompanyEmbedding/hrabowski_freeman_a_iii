maryland baltimore county says his parents taught him how to develop a tough skin and a strong sense of self this interview with freeman a hrabowski iii president of the university of maryland baltimore county was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq tell me about your early yearsa i grew up in birmingham and was fortunate to have older educated parents everything was about learning to work hard and to be resilient in our middleclass africanamerican neighborhood people worked to prepare their kids for a world that might not be fair the message was that there’s no time to be a victim and never give uptell me more about your parentsmy father left education to work in a steel mill because he could make more money for his family working in the steel mill than being a teacher and administrator in the school nevertheless he worked with the black men there to help them get their geds so he was always still teachingand my mother was an english teacher who later became a math teacher so my background has always been a combination of language and mathematics continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story i learned from my parents my community and my church that we are in all of this together when i was  i heard martin luther king talk about the role children could play in the changing of america and i participated in the children’s march in birmingham in  i spent a week in jailwhat were you doing outside of class when you were youngeri was a nerd we were always reading and i came to appreciate the significance of reading skills and the ways in which disciplines can connect to solve problems you don’t just solve them from one anglefor me the civil rights movement was about thinking about the problems of our country like how do we create an environment in which kids have the right to a great educationi often hear students today say that we’ve never been so divided as a country i remind them to think about the sif you were to ask me the hardest problem we as educators have right now i would say it is to prepare our students to understand the importance of the word “citizen” the challenge is to make sure that educated people have a good understanding of all the different disciplines and how they connect it’s about critical thinking advertisement continue reading the main story the messages from your parents about the importance of grit — those were explicitvery explicit they talked often about the idea that some things are not fair you want to work to change what you can and if you can’t change it the question is how do you deal with itthey were really preparing me for a world that wouldn’t immediately assume that i’d be the best thinker how do you develop the toughness of skin but also a strong sense of self it’s this balance between confidence and humilitydid you move into leadership roles quicklyeven when i was a grad student i would always speak up and say what i thought was not working well so people would tell me “then you do it” i was always working with other people and saying “let’s figure out how to make this better” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify

email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime from grad school on i was doing a combination of teaching and administration but most important i was trying to understand human behavior why is it that two students can come from the same background and one can be focused and hungry and the other can be bored and not motivated how do you find ways of getting students to connect to the work and take it seriously what about leadership lessons later in lifein meetings i had to learn to not be so quick to give a response to breathe deeply and allow the energy of the room to lead to more discussion i was much too quick to think i had the answer in the early yearshow do you hirefirst of all i look for chemistry the ability of the person to connect human being to human being do they have the ability to have interesting conversations about ideas involving education and to listenmost important do they have the ability to ask good questions and to give answers that show they are a deep thinker and not that they know everything i’m sometimes more impressed with somebody who leaves me with more questions than answersi find that the newer somebody is to an idea the more confident that person often is that he or she has the answer the more time you spend diving into the work the more often you’re comfortable saying “i’m working on it”what questions do you askgive me an example of a challenge you faced involving management of people how do you go about handling someone who is not effective on the job what approach do you use in making decisions about that person’s future advertisement continue reading the main story what i want to hear is that every situation is different it’s never quite that obvious and simple i’ve had people say to me “i’ll just fire them” i don’t want somebody who’s just going to be so quick and harsh i want somebody who’s willing to understand more about the situationwhat i’m trying to see is whether the person understands the complexity of life itself it’s never that simple it’s always about understanding why somebody isn’t doing a good job and what you can do to help themwhat career and life advice do you give to new college gradsnothing takes the place of hard work i keep going back to that we make the mistake in our country of telling some kids they’re smart or they’re not smart i have found that the most effective people really give it all they haveit’s about finding ways of using your brainpower to work as effectively as possible to reach your goals and never give up and continue to work at it and the world is not necessarily fair get over it just keep being your best develop that tough skin continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think

he never expected that the world might change and that black and white students would one day study togetherbut hearing king speak changed everything for hrabowski who convinced his parents that he needed to answer kings call to stand up for equality while participating in the famed childrens crusade he spent five terrifying nights in jailduring which freeman became a leader for the younger kids

whom were educators his mother was an english teacher who decided to become a math teacher and she used the young hrabowski as a guinea pig at home his father had been a math teacher and then went to work at a steel mill because as hrabowski is quoted as saying frankly he could make more money doing that frequently asked about the origin of his unusual surname hrabowski explains that he is the

nights shielding other youngsters and comforting them by reading his bible aloud or singing songs after being reunited with the adults hrabowski remembers the rev dr martin luther king telling them “what you do this day will have an impact on generations as yet unborn kings words resonated with hrabowski and ultimately rang true as the national outrage at the brutality against birmingham

of the meyerhoff scholarship program initially designed to help smart black males become scientists and engineers the program he cofounded with robert meyerhoff quickly expanded to include students of all races and both genders who are interested in the advancement of minorities in the sciences and related fields the meyerhoff program has since become a national model for colleges and universities everywhere freeman hrabowski at the opening of the performing arts  humanities building at the university of maryland baltimore county it was hrabowski’s background that empowered him to take several bold administrative actions such as disbanding an africana graduate studies program and refusing to field a college football team in favor of funding math undergraduates and a championship chess team

singing songs after being reunited with the adults hrabowski remembers the rev dr martin luther king telling them “what you do this day will have an impact on generations as yet unborn kings words
