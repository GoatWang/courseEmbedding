securities law that makes it legal for the general public to invest in a private growthstage company before the company’s stocks are publicly traded here’s what usually happened before the new law existed only rich people who had a net worth of  million or those with an annual salary of over  were allowed to invest early then the company grew until it went to an ipo and stock started being publicly traded so everyone else only got the opportunity to invest once the company growth had slowed down that’s why rich people early investors made much more money than the lessrich people late investors but now with reg a miniipo you do not need to be rich to invest you just need to commit to not invest more than  of your annual income or net worth everyone can invest good luck q what does
