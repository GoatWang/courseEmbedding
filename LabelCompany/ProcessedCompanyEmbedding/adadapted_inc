mcfarland developed technology that allows clients to create ads automatically but make them look customdesigned going grocery shopping with native advertising a shopper sees a sponsored recipe in a grocery store app hungry shopper clicks on recipe list of ingredients includes advertised product shopper adds product to grocery list courtesy of adadapted better late than never adadapted inc an ann arbor firm that helps companies build ads designed for mobile devices has finished raising its seedstage round of funding of  the company was expected to announce the news on july  — many months after it originally planned to finish raising capital last september the company was halfway to its original target of  and founders cmo molly mcfarland and ceo mike pedersen believed they were on track to receive  from the michigan preseed capital fund instead the michigan economic development corp stopped funding the program people told us dont count on anything til you get it but the truth is we were counting on that money said mcfarland it was back to fundraising for adadapted veteran angel investor and consultant terry cross made a personal investment in the company and helped bring in more money from his range of contacts what helped too was that the market for what adadapted was trying to do had quickly heated up the company builds whats known in the industry as native ads which is advertising that is integrated with other content and sometimes appears as content itself native ads create more clickthroughs and less frustration on mobile devices than dropdown and banner ads which are meant for larger screens adadapteds customers are companies with mobile apps while adadapted worked to raise money native had become a hot topic in the mobile ad industry and was attracting the attention of investors mcfarland and pedersen founded adadapted in  both left amplifinity inc a fastgrowing ann arbor company that uses social media websites to help companies build their businesses through customer and employee referrals she had been a marketing officer and he had been a software developer mcfarland said pedersen got the idea for adadapted and with the blessing of amplifinity founder dick beedon left to form the company people were spending more time on smartphones she said but the ad model was broken ads that worked on computers dont work on small screens ads only work if theyre developed specifically for the platform theyll be seen on youre more likely to climb mount everest than you are to click on a banner ad on your smartphone adadapteds ads are integrated into content mcfarland said so if you have a grocery list the ad might appear as a sponsored item on that list or we may use colors sizing and type font to format the ad so it reflects the apps look feel and content what she described as the secret sauce for adadapted is that its technology allows clients to create ads automatically but make them look customdesigned the company has applied for a provisional patent covering that process it is a process and patent that mcfarland hopes will help adadapted carve out a niche in the soontobe crowded space of native advertising large competitors include torontobased polar mobile group inc bangalore indiabased inmobi and san franciscobased liquidm inc adadapted projects revenue in  of more than  million the goal is never to trick the user mcfarland said but instead to show users that each advertisement was designed for their favorite apps and the ad messaging is connected to the apps content not some generic ad blindly served anywhere ronda guimond is media director of ann arborbased enlighten inc a digital ad agency that decided to try adadapted last year when it was in beta testing enlighten launched a mobile ad campaign for biore a line of skin care products biore was trying to reach women ages  and the best way was with mobile ads but traditional ads developed for other digital media were notoriously bad guimond said annoying to the point that they engendered ill will in consumers and few clickthroughs and sales guimond said adadapteds ads were lowcost efficient and provided enough eyeballs and impressions to show it was well worth the spend adadapted also did some project work for the detroit lions last season but the team is hiring a new digital director and so any work for the coming season is up on the air scott brew is president and ceo of adtegrity inc a grand rapidsbased digital advertising firm that has been around for  years has about  employees and does about  million in business a year brew said he heard about adadapted more than a year ago through carl erickson after mcfarland made a pitch for funding to the grand angels an angel investing group that erickson is a part of erickson is also founder of atomic object a grand rapidsbased app website and software developer that has offices in detroit and ann arbor atomic objects ann arbor office has been serving as adadapteds temporary headquarters while it raised funding adadapted now will be able to find space of its own build up its team and heavily market the product erickson told brew that he ought to meet mcfarland and that some synergies might be found between the two companies brew said that he liked what adadapted does enough to become an investor himself and that the two companies probably will be making pitches together to clients looking for broad advertising solutions its pretty exciting to be working with them adadapted reduces the friction of advertising on mobile platforms theyve created a system that allows advertisers to run flowing ads that arent disruptive and irritating companies can create customized ads based on adadapteds platform that make it easy to create a placement without having to go back to their inhouse people and taking three weeks to do it other investors include the studentmanaged frankel commercialization fund at the university of michigan the detroitbased first step fund grand rapidsbased start garden michigan preseed fund  and the grosse pointe farmsbased belle michigan fund lp which is advised by cross and invests in womanowned technology companies adadapted also has received  in loans and  in grants from ann arbor spark it has four fulltime employees and six parttimers last month adadapted was one of  finalists that pitched to aol cofounder steve case in detroit when he kicked off his rise of the rest tour to promote technology startups theyve got a good product that has already been validated in the marketplace cross said mobile advertising today is something people hate so native advertising is a big big opportunity and theyve found a way to provide a platform so theres native advertising you can do yourself but what i really like is they have someone who can market the heck out of it and thats molly she leaves no stone unturned she understands the industry and she walks the walktom henderson   email protected twitter tomhenderson

answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
