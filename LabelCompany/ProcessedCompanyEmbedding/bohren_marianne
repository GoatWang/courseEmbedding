approved its  operating and capital budgets at its regular board meeting last night rate changes for wastewater services will result in an increase of less than  percent for nearly all the 7 communities served by wlssd “we’ve contained costs for our wastewater services and been able to keep rates relatively flat over the past five years” said marianne bohren wlssd executive director “our major cost driver is electricity where we’ve seen a  rate increase over the past eight years with electricity making up  of our operating costs we are excited to begin the first phase of our energy self sufficiency projects” wlssd’s capital improvement budget also approved at the meeting includes the first of four phases of wlssd’s energy project that will move the district toward energy selfsufficiency the  energy projects will prepare the district for the future installation of equipment that allows wlssd to generate electricity to cover a portion of its electrical needs the board also approved a  increase to solid waste management fees effective january   executive director marianne bohren stated “about  of the cost of providing recycling solid waste education composting and hazardous waste services to the region are covered by solid waste management fees collected on residential property taxes and by fees included on residential and commercial garbage bills these fees have remained unchanged over the past nine years while the amount of materials being successfully diverted from landfilling through these programs has increased significantly as a result garbage volumes have decreased and recycling rates have increased this is excellent news however with funding for these programs directly tied to garbage volumes we are challenged by reduced revenue and increased demand for these programs it is time to adjust these fees to ensure we continue to increase recycling and protect our environment well into the future” the wlssd board approved the following changes to the solid waste management fees effective january   under a twopart system adopted in 7 · the haulercollected portion of swmfs for residents will not increase in  remaining at  per gallon the fee collected on residential property taxes will increase from  per year to  per year seasonal properties will be charged  per year · nonresidential garbage producers will pay an increased hauler collected fee on their garbage bill this fee will increase from the current  per cubic yard of noncompacted garbage to  per cubic yard compacted garbage fees increasing from cubic yard to cubic yard

wisconsin wood waste banned from wlssd facilities to help reduce spread of emerald ash borer western lake superior sanitary district wlssd has placed an immediate ban on acceptance of brush and wood waste originating from wisconsin at the wlssd yard waste compost site and materials recovery center the ban has placed to aid in curtailing the spread of the emerald ash borer emerald ash borer has recently been discovered in superior wi and the state of wisconsin has quarantined all ash logs ash byproducts and hardwood firewood prohibiting the movement of this material out of the quarantined area “to reduce the potential spread of the emerald ash borer more broadly in the northland we had no choice but to place this temporary ban at our facilities” said marianne bohren wlssd executive director “because it’s difficult for staff at our busy facilities to distinguish between various tree species we’ve placed a complete ban on wood waste from wisconsin we believe this will aid wisconsin in successfully reducing the devastating impacts of emerald ash borer help to prevent its spread into other areas of the region” the wlssd ban impacts wood waste originating in wisconsin only wlssd will continue to collect wood waste originating in minnesota and leafy vegetative waste from either state “wisconsin residents may continue to bring their leafy wastes like lawn clippings garden debris and leaves to the yard waste compost site” continued bohren wisconsin residents are advised to use brush and wood disposal services at the city of superior landfill on moccasin mike road
