federal claims prompting strong criticism after hearing thirtyseven days of testimony and requiring appearances by ben bernanke timothy geithner and hank paulson judge thomas c wheeler ruled that the federal reserve responses to the subprime crisis had been illegal the court reasoned the aig bailout had been an illegal exaction because the federal reserve act did not authorize the new york fed to nationalize a corporation by owning its stock however judge wheeler did not award monetary compensation to the plaintiffs ruling that they did not suffer economic damage because if the government had done nothing the shareholders would have been left with  percent of nothing both parties appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit the new york fed volunteered an amicus

david boies sue the us government separately for money damages in the united states court of federal claims prompting strong criticism after hearing thirtyseven days of testimony and requiring appearances by ben bernanke timothy geithner and hank paulson judge thomas c wheeler ruled that the federal reserve responses to the subprime crisis had been illegal the court reasoned the aig bailout had been an illegal exaction because the federal reserve act did not authorize the new york fed to nationalize a corporation by owning its stock however judge wheeler did not award monetary compensation to the plaintiffs ruling that they did not suffer economic damage because if the government had done nothing the shareholders would have been left with  percent of nothing both parties appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit the new york fed volunteered an amicus brief arguing that “apart from an erroneous interpretation of a federal statute the trial

law preempted any delaware fiduciary duties owed to shareholders money damagesedit hank greenberg next had david boies sue the us government separately for money damages in the united states court of federal claims prompting strong criticism after hearing thirtyseven days of testimony and requiring appearances by ben bernanke timothy geithner and hank paulson judge thomas c wheeler ruled that the federal reserve responses to the subprime crisis had been illegal the court reasoned the aig bailout had been an illegal exaction because the federal reserve act did not authorize the new york fed to nationalize a corporation by owning its stock however judge wheeler did not award monetary compensation to the plaintiffs ruling that they did not suffer economic damage because if the government had done nothing the shareholders would have been left with  percent of nothing both parties appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit the new york fed volunteered an amicus

david boies sue the us government separately for money damages in the united states court of federal claims prompting strong criticism after hearing thirtyseven days of testimony and requiring appearances by ben bernanke timothy geithner and hank paulson judge thomas c wheeler ruled that the federal reserve responses to the subprime crisis had been illegal the court reasoned the aig bailout had been an illegal exaction because the federal reserve act did not authorize the new york fed to nationalize a corporation by owning its stock however judge wheeler did not award monetary compensation to the plaintiffs ruling that they did not suffer economic damage because if the government had done nothing the shareholders would have been left with  percent of nothing both parties appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit the new york fed volunteered an amicus brief arguing that “apart from an erroneous interpretation of a federal statute the trial

law preempted any delaware fiduciary duties owed to shareholders money damagesedit hank greenberg next had david boies sue the us government separately for money damages in the united states court of federal claims prompting strong criticism after hearing thirtyseven days of testimony and requiring appearances by ben bernanke timothy geithner and hank paulson judge thomas c wheeler ruled that the federal reserve responses to the subprime crisis had been illegal the court reasoned the aig bailout had been an illegal exaction because the federal reserve act did not authorize the new york fed to nationalize a corporation by owning its stock however judge wheeler did not award monetary compensation to the plaintiffs ruling that they did not suffer economic damage because if the government had done nothing the shareholders would have been left with  percent of nothing both parties appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit the new york fed volunteered an amicus

david boies sue the us government separately for money damages in the united states court of federal claims prompting strong criticism after hearing thirtyseven days of testimony and requiring appearances by ben bernanke timothy geithner and hank paulson judge thomas c wheeler ruled that the federal reserve responses to the subprime crisis had been illegal the court reasoned the aig bailout had been an illegal exaction because the federal reserve act did not authorize the new york fed to nationalize a corporation by owning its stock however judge wheeler did not award monetary compensation to the plaintiffs ruling that they did not suffer economic damage because if the government had done nothing the shareholders would have been left with  percent of nothing both parties appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit the new york fed volunteered an amicus brief arguing that “apart from an erroneous interpretation of a federal statute the trial
