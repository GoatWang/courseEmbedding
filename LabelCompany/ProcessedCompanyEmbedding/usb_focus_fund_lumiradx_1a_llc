nav bitcoin index price and bitcoin holdings bitcoins are held by the custodian on behalf of the trust and are carried for financial statement purposes at fair value as required by the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the trust determines the fair value of bitcoins based on the price provided by the bitcoin exchange that the trust considers its principal market as of  pm new york time on the valuation date the net asset value of the trust determined on a gaap basis is referred to in this prospectus as nav to determine which exchange is the trusts principal market for purposes of calculating the trusts nav the trust considers only bitcoin exchanges that are us dollardenominated have an online platform and publish transaction price and volume data publicly based on these requirements the trust prepares a list of eligible bitcoin exchanges and considers the following criteria to select its principal market i the volume of bitcoin traded on a bitcoin exchange in the prior twelve months ii a bitcoin exchanges regulatory compliance with applicable federal and state licensing requirements and practices regarding antimoney laundering procedures and iii the degree of intraday price fluctuations a bitcoin exchange experiences as well as the degree of variance in prices across bitcoin exchanges in determining which of the eligible bitcoin exchanges is the trusts principal market the trust reviews these criteria in the following order        first the trust sorts the list of eligible bitcoin exchanges from high to low by volume of bitcoin traded on each bitcoin exchanges in the prior twelve months the trust moves down the list until it reaches a bitcoin exchange that has a volume of bitcoin traded for the prior twelve months that is less than  of the next largest bitcoin exchange and excludes this and all smaller bitcoin exchanges from the list however the list will always contain a minimum of three bitcoin exchanges even if the percentage of volume drops to less than  of the next largest bitcoin exchange        second the trust reviews the remaining bitcoin exchanges and excludes any bitcoin exchanges that do not comply with the federal and state licensing requirements that are applicable to the trust and the authorized participants the trust authorized participants or liquidity providers can only do business with those bitcoin exchanges that meet the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which the trust or an authorized participants or liquidity providers are registered to do business for example the trust is registered to do business in new york and thus can only do business with bitcoin exchanges that have applied for a bitlicense as required by new york law if an authorized participant or liquidity provider however is registered in a different jurisdiction such authorized participant or liquidity provider and by extension the trust could do business with any bitcoin exchange that meets the regulatory requirements of that jurisdiction even if they do not meet the regulatory requirements in new york the trust also assesses each bitcoin exchanges practices regarding antimoney laundering procedures        third the trust then reviews intraday pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on bitcoin exchanges to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular bitcoin exchange the trust then selects a bitcoin exchange as its principal market based on highest trade volume and price stability in comparison to the other bitcoin exchanges on the list the trust determines its principal market annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine if i there have been recent changes to each bitcoin exchanges transaction volume in the prior twelve months ii if any bitcoin exchanges have fallen out of or come into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements iii if the trust has engaged any new authorized participant or liquidity provider that due to being registered to do business in another jurisdiction would make bitcoin exchanges previously inaccessible to the trust now accessible or iv if recent changes to each bitcoin exchanges price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the trusts determination of its principal market   iv table of contents intraday price fluctuations across the exchanges are relatively immaterial and the variance of prices on bitcoin exchanges with the highest transaction volumes is rarely greater than  these variances usually stem from small changes in the fee structures on different bitcoin exchanges or differences in administrative procedures required to deposit and withdraw fiat currency in exchange for bitcoins and vice versa the greatest variances are found at i smaller exchanges with relatively low transaction volumes where even small trades can be large relative to an exchanges transaction volume and as a result impact the trading price on those exchanges ii exchanges that are inaccessible to the trust because they do not meet the trusts regulatory requirements or iii exchanges that lack adequate compliance controls such as knowyourcustomer procedures and as a result are accessed and used by a captured market or by parties that do not have regulatory or compliance requirements historically the trust has not needed to make any changes in the determination of principal market due to variances in pricing although it has changed its principal market due to disruption of operations of the bitcoin exchange considered to be the principal market historically the trust considered bitstamp to be its principal market with an exception for the period of january   through january   when the trust relied on pricing from bitfinex on january   bitstamp suffered a disruption of operations and in accordance with the trusts procedures for determining its principal market the trust relied upon bitfinex until january   when the trust determined that it could again rely upon bitstamp as the principal market the trust performed an assessment of the principal market at december   in accordance with its accounting policies and identified a change in the principal market from bitstamp to global digital asset exchange gdax formerly known as coinbase exchange the trust has applied this change in principal market effective december   and has valued bitcoin held by the trust since december   using the gdax exchange the trusts investment objective is for the shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the index less the trusts liabilities and expenses accordingly the trusts aggregate and per share value is tracked by reference to the bitcoin index price which is the price of a bitcoin derived from multiple bitcoin exchanges that are reflected in the index the trust believes that calculating the bitcoin index price in this manner mitigates the impact of anomalistic or manipulative trading that may occur on any single bitcoin exchange see overview of the bitcoin industry and marketbitcoin valuethe index and the bitcoin index price the trust uses the bitcoin index price to calculate its bitcoin holdings which is the aggregate us dollar value of bitcoins in the trust based on the bitcoin index price less its liabilities and expenses bitcoin holdings per share is calculated by dividing bitcoin holdings by the number of shares currently outstanding bitcoin holdings and bitcoin holdings per share are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap bitcoin holdings is not intended to be a substitute for the trusts nav calculated in accordance with gaap and bitcoin holdings per share is not intended to be a substitute for the trusts nav per share calculated in accordance with gaap   v table of contents prospectus summary this is only a

xbx index the index to calculate a volumeweighted perbitcoin value in us dollars the bitcoin index price the bitcoin index price is calculated by applying a weighting algorithm to the price and volume of all bitcoin data from selected trading venues for the immediately preceding hour period as of  pm new york time on the valuation date the bitcoin index price is calculated using a nongaap methodology and is not used in the trusts financial statements included in this prospectus     the index is a us dollardenominated composite reference rate for the price of bitcoin based on the volumeweighted price at trading venues selected by tradeblock inc the index provider to ensure that the index providers trading venue selection process is impartial the index provider considers depth of liquidity compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements data availability us domicile and acceptance of us dollar deposits in the calculation of the bitcoin index price the index provider cleanses the trade data and compiles it in such a manner as to algorithmically reduce the impact of anomalistic or manipulative trading this is accomplished by adjusting the weight of each input based on price deviation relative to the observable set of data for the relevant trading venue as well as recent and longterm trading volume at each venue relative to the observable set for the relevant trading venues      table of contents the index provider formally reevaluates the weighting algorithm quarterly but maintains discretion to change the way in which the index is calculated based on its periodic review or in extreme circumstances while the index does not currently utilize data from overthecounter markets or derivative platforms the index provider may decide to include

obtaining exemptive relief from the sec to reinstate its redemption program the trust intends to redeem shares in baskets on an ongoing basis from authorized participants see risk factorsrisk factors related to the regulation of the trust and the sharesthe trust and an affiliate of the trust recently entered into a settlement agreement with the sec concerning the operation of the trusts former redemption program and description of the sharesredemption of the shares a basket equals  shares as of the date of this prospectus each share represents approximately  of a bitcoin see description of creation and redemption of shares     the creation and redemption of baskets require the delivery to the trust or the distribution by the trust of the number of bitcoins represented by the baskets being created or redeemed the number of which is determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the trust at  pm new york time on the trade date of a creation or redemption order as adjusted for the number of whole and fractional bitcoins constituting accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the trust by the number of shares outstanding at such time the quotient so obtained calculated to one onehundredmillionth of one bitcoin and multiplying such quotient by  the basket bitcoin amount the number of bitcoins required to create a basket or to be delivered      table of contents   upon the redemption of a basket will gradually decrease over time due to the transfer of the trusts bitcoins to pay the sponsors fee and the delivery or sale of the trusts bitcoins to pay any trust expenses not assumed by the sponsor the trust will not accept or distribute cash in exchange for baskets other than upon its dissolution see description of creation and redemption of shares and activities of the trusttrust expenses   although the trust will create baskets only upon the receipt of bitcoins and will redeem baskets only by distributing bitcoins an

risks described below before making an investment decision you should also refer to the other information included in this prospectus including the trusts financial statements and related notes thereto risk factors related to the bitcoin network and bitcoins the loss or destruction of a private key required to access a bitcoin may be irreversible the trusts loss of access to its private keys or its experience of a data loss relating to the trusts bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in the shares bitcoins are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the bitcoins are held while the bitcoin network requires a public key relating to a digital wallet to be published when used in a spending transaction private keys must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent a third party from accessing the bitcoins held in such wallet to the extent a private key is lost destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible the trust will be unable to access the bitcoins held in the related digital wallet and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the bitcoin network any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store the trusts bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in the shares the further development and acceptance of the bitcoin network and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of transactions in bitcoins and other digital currencies which represent a new and rapidly changing industry are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of the bitcoin network may adversely affect an investment in the shares the use of digital currencies such as bitcoins to among other things buy and sell goods and services is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that employs digital assets based upon a computergenerated mathematical andor cryptographic protocol bitcoin is a prominent but not a unique part of this industry the growth of this industry in general and the bitcoin network in particular is subject to a high degree of uncertainty the factors affecting the further development of this industry include but are not limited to        continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins and other digital currencies        government and quasigovernment regulation of bitcoins and other digital assets and their use or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the bitcoin network or similar digital asset systems        changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences        the maintenance and development of the opensource software protocol of the bitcoin network        the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services including new means of using fiat currencies        general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets and        negative consumer perception of bitcoins specifically and cryptocurrencies generally the trust is not actively managed and will not have any strategy relating to the development of the bitcoin network furthermore the sponsor cannot be certain as to the impact of the listing of the shares and the expansion of its bitcoin holdings on the digital asset industry and the bitcoin network a decline in the popularity or acceptance of the bitcoin network would harm the price of the shares    table of contents currently there is relatively small use of bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively large use by speculators thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in the shares bitcoins and the bitcoin network have only recently become accepted as a means of payment for goods and services by certain major retail and commercial outlets and use of bitcoins by consumers to pay such retail and commercial outlets remains limited conversely a significant portion of bitcoin demand is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short or longterm holding of bitcoins a lack of expansion by bitcoins into retail and commercial markets or a contraction of such use may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the bitcoin index price either of which could adversely affect an investment in the shares the core developers or other programmers could propose amendments to the bitcoin networks protocols and software that if accepted and authorized by the bitcoin network community could adversely affect an investment in the shares the bitcoin network uses a cryptographic protocol to govern the peertopeer interactions between computers connected to the bitcoin network the code that sets forth the protocol is informally managed by a development team known as the core developers that was initially appointed informally by the bitcoin networks purported creator satoshi nakamoto the members of the core developers evolve over time largely based on selfdetermined participation in the resource section dedicated to bitcoin on githubcom the core developers can propose amendments to the bitcoin networks source code through software upgrades that alter the protocols and software of the bitcoin network and the properties of bitcoins including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoins proposals for upgrades and related discussions take place on online forums including githubcom and bitcointalkorg to the extent that a significant majority of the users and miners on the bitcoin network install such software upgrades the bitcoin network would be subject to new protocols and software that may adversely affect an investment in the shares if a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than  of the processing power on the bitcoin network such actor or botnet could manipulate the blockchain to adversely affect an investment in the shares or the ability of the trust to operate if a malicious actor or botnet a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on the bitcoin network it may be able to alter the blockchain on which the bitcoin network and most bitcoin transactions rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner or at all the malicious actor or botnet could control exclude or modify the ordering of transactions though it could not generate new bitcoins or transactions using such control the malicious actor could doublespend its own bitcoins ie spend the same bitcoins in more than one transaction and prevent the confirmation of other users transactions for so long as it maintained control to the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the bitcoin network or the bitcoin community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible although there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of the blockchain achieved through controlling over  of the processing power on the network it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded the  threshold the possible crossing of the  threshold indicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions to the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem including the core developers and the administrators of mining pools do not act to ensure greater decentralization of bitcoin mining processing power the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power on the bitcoin network will increase which may adversely affect an investment in the shares    table of contents if the award of bitcoins for solving blocks and transaction fees for recording transactions are not sufficiently high to incentivize miners miners may cease expending processing power to solve blocks and confirmations of transactions on the blockchain could be slowed temporarily a reduction in the processing power expended by miners on the bitcoin network could increase the likelihood of a malicious actor or botnet obtaining control if the award of new bitcoins for solving blocks declines and transaction fees are not sufficiently high miners may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease their mining operations miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power on the bitcoin network which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions ie temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to the blockchain until the next scheduled adjustment in difficulty for block solutions and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to a malicious actor or botnet obtaining control in excess of  of the processing power on the bitcoin network which would allow such actor or botnet to manipulate the blockchain and hinder transactions any reduction in confidence in the confirmation process or processing power of the bitcoin network may adversely affect an investment in the shares if fees increase for recording transactions in the blockchain demand for bitcoins may be reduced and prevent the expansion of the bitcoin network to retail merchants and commercial businesses resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoins that could adversely affect an investment in the shares as the number of bitcoins awarded for solving a block in the blockchain decreases the incentive for miners to contribute processing power to the bitcoin network will transition from a set reward to transaction fees in order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute processing power to the bitcoin network the bitcoin network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a block if miners demand higher transaction fees to recording transactions in the blockchain or a software upgrade automatically charges fees for all transactions the cost of using bitcoins may increase and the marketplace may be reluctant to accept bitcoins as a means of payment existing users may be motivated to switch from bitcoins to another digital currency or back to fiat currency decreased use and demand for bitcoins may adversely affect their value and result in a reduction in the bitcoin index price and the price of the shares to the extent that the profit margins of bitcoin mining operations are not high bitcoin miners are more likely to immediately sell bitcoins earned by mining in the bitcoin exchange market resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoins that could adversely affect an investment in the shares over the past several years bitcoin network mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors graphics processing units and first generation asic applicationspecific integrated circuit machines currently new processing power brought onto the bitcoin network is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated professionalized mining operations professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated asic machines acquired from asic manufacturers they require the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware the leasing of operating space often in data centers or warehousing facilities incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms as a result professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior bitcoin network miners and have more defined regular expenses and liabilities these regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to more immediately sell bitcoins earned from mining operations on the bitcoin exchange market bitcoin exchange market whereas it is believed that individual miners in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoins for more extended periods the immediate selling of newly mined bitcoins would increase the supply of bitcoins on the bitcoin exchange market creating downward pressure on the price of bitcoins the extent to which the value of bitcoins mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation a professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined bitcoins rapidly if it is operating at a    table of contents low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative in a low profit margin environment a higher percentage of the  to  new bitcoins mined each day will be sold into the bitcoin exchange market more rapidly thereby reducing bitcoin prices further in july  the reward for mining bitcoins was reduced from  bitcoins to  bitcoins thereby further reducing the profit margin lower bitcoin prices will result in further tightening of profit margins particularly for professionalized mining operations with higher costs and more limited capital reserves creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of bitcoins until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining power from the bitcoin network the network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined bitcoins could result in a reduction in the price of bitcoins that could adversely affect an investment in the shares to the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in the bitcoin network which could adversely impact an investment in the shares to the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks such transactions will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees currently there are no known incentives for miners to elect to exclude the recording of transactions in solved blocks however to the extent that any such incentives arise for example a collective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing bitcoin users to pay transaction fees as a substitute for or in addition to the award of new bitcoins upon the solving of a block miners could delay the recording and confirmation of a significant number of transactions on the blockchain if such delays became systemic it could result in greater exposure to doublespending transactions and a loss of confidence in the bitcoin network which could adversely affect an investment in the shares the acceptance of bitcoin network software patches or upgrades by a significant but not overwhelming percentage of the users and miners in the bitcoin network could result in a fork in the blockchain resulting in the operation of two separate networks there is no official developer or group of developers that formally controls the bitcoin network any individual can download the bitcoin network software and make any desired modifications which are proposed to users and miners on the bitcoin network through software downloads and upgrades typically posted to the bitcoin development forum on githubcom a substantial majority of miners and bitcoin users must consent to such software modifications by downloading the altered software or upgrade otherwise the modifications do not become a part of the bitcoin network since the bitcoin networks inception modifications to the bitcoin network have been accepted by the vast majority of users and miners ensuring that the bitcoin network remains a coherent economic system if however a proposed modification is not accepted by a vast majority of miners and users but is nonetheless accepted by a substantial population of participants in the bitcoin network a fork in the blockchain could develop resulting in two separate bitcoin networks such a fork in the blockchain typically would be addressed by communityled efforts to merge the forked blockchains and several prior forks have been so merged however if a permanent fork were to occur there is a remote possibility that bitcoin would evolve into two slightly different versions for example in  ethereum a digital currency experienced a permanent fork in its blockchain that resulted in two slightly different versions of the digital currency communityled efforts to merge the blockchains were not successful and a small minority of ethereum holders continued to support the old blockchain this led to the development of two distinct blockchains that produced two slightly different versions    table of contents of ethereum ethereum and ethereum classic therefore holders of ethereum classic were given an equal number of the new ethereum currency and therefore held equal numbers of ethereum classic and ethereum when the fork became permanent if a permanent fork similar to the one which occurred with respect to ethereum were to occur with respect to bitcoin the trust would hold equal amounts of the original and the new bitcoin as a result in that event and subject to the requirement that the trust continue to be treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes the sponsor expects that it would i in consultation with the index provider select a bitcoin network and therefore a single version of bitcoin and ii simultaneously isolate the bitcoin on the bitcoin network that it did not select in order to segregate it from the bitcoin the trust would continue to hold in that case the sponsors intention would be to distribute to its shareholders the bitcoin on the bitcoin network that it did not select with the result that the trust would only hold one version of bitcoin it is uncertain whether the value of any such distribution of the bitcoin on the bitcoin network that the sponsor did not select would equal the change in the value of the shares resulting from such distribution consequently a permanent fork could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the bitcoin network and could cause the termination of the trust third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims relating to the operation of digital currencies and their source code relating to the holding and transfer of such assets regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action any threatened action that reduces confidence in the bitcoin networks longterm viability or the ability of endusers to hold and transfer bitcoins may adversely affect an investment in the shares additionally a meritorious intellectual property rights claim could prevent the trust and other endusers from accessing the bitcoin network or holding or transferring their bitcoins which could force the sponsor to terminate the trust and liquidate the trusts bitcoins if such liquidation of the trusts bitcoins is possible as a result an intellectual property rights claim against the trust or other large bitcoin network participants could adversely affect an investment in the shares the opensource structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the core developers and other contributors are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the bitcoin network protocol a failure to properly monitor and upgrade the bitcoin network protocol could damage the bitcoin network and an investment in the shares the bitcoin network operates based on an opensource protocol maintained by the core developers and other contributors largely on the github resource section dedicated to bitcoin development as the bitcoin network protocol is not sold and its use does not generate revenues for its development team the core developers are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the bitcoin network protocol consequently there is a lack of financial incentive for developers to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the core developers may lack the resources to adequately address emerging issues with the bitcoin network protocol although the bitcoin network is currently supported by the core developers there can be no guarantee that such support will continue or be sufficient in the future to the extent that material issues arise with the bitcoin network protocol and the core developers and opensource contributors are unable to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner the bitcoin network and an investment in the shares may be adversely affected risk factors related to the bitcoin exchange market and the index the value of the shares relates directly to the value of the bitcoins held by the trust and fluctuations in the price of bitcoins could materially and adversely affect an investment in the shares the shares are designed to mirror as closely as possible the performance of the price of bitcoins as measured by the index and the value of the shares relates directly to the value of the bitcoins held by the trust less the trusts liabilities including estimated accrued but unpaid fees and expenses using a composite    table of contents reference rate of volumeweighted trading data the index is derived from the transaction prices on electronic market places where exchange participants may first use fiat currency to trade buy and sell bitcoins based on bidask trading a bitcoin exchange the index uses us dollardenominated trading data from the bitcoin exchanges to determine the bitcoin index price whether a bitcoin exchange is considered eligible to be included in the indexs calculation depends on considerations such as depth of liquidity compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements data availability us domicile and acceptance of us dollar deposits the price of bitcoins has fluctuated widely over the past several years and may continue to experience significant price fluctuations several factors may affect the bitcoin index price including but not limited to        total bitcoins in existence estimated at approximately  million as of april   according to wwwblockchaininfo        global bitcoin demand which is influenced by the growth of retail merchants and commercial businesses acceptance of bitcoins as payment for goods and services the security of online bitcoin exchanges and digital wallets that hold bitcoins the perception that the use and holding of bitcoins is safe and secure the lack of regulatory restrictions on their use and the reputation of bitcoins for illicit use        global bitcoin supply which is influenced by similar factors as global bitcoin demand in addition to fiat currency needs by miners for example to invest in equipment or pay electricity bills and taxpayers who may liquidate bitcoin holdings around tax deadlines to meet tax obligations        investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation of fiat currencies        investors expectations with respect to the rate of deflation of bitcoin        interest rates        currency exchange rates including the rates at which bitcoins may be exchanged for fiat currencies        fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of bitcoin exchanges and liquidity of such bitcoin exchanges        interruptions in service from or failures of major bitcoin exchanges        cyber theft of bitcoins from online bitcoin wallet providers or news of such theft from such providers or from individuals bitcoin wallets        investment and trading activities of large investors including private and registered funds that may directly or indirectly invest in bitcoins        monetary policies of governments trade restrictions currency devaluations and revaluations        regulatory measures if any that restrict the use of bitcoins as a form of payment or the purchase of bitcoins on the bitcoin market        the availability and popularity of businesses that provide bitcoinrelated services        the maintenance and development of the opensource software protocol of the bitcoin network        increased competition from other forms of cryptocurrency or payments services        global or regional political economic or financial events and situations        expectations among bitcoin economy participants that the value of bitcoins will soon change and        fees associated with processing a bitcoin transaction if bitcoin markets continue to be subject to sharp fluctuations you may experience losses if you need to sell your shares at a time when the price of bitcoins is lower than it was when you made your prior investment even if you are able to hold shares for the longterm your shares may never generate a profit since bitcoin markets have historically experienced extended periods of flat or declining prices in addition to sharp fluctuations    table of contents in addition investors should be aware that there is no assurance that bitcoins will maintain their longterm value in terms of future purchasing power or that the acceptance of bitcoin payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will continue to grow in the event that the price of bitcoins declines the sponsor expects the value of an investment in the shares to decline proportionately the value of bitcoins as represented by the bitcoin index price may be subject to momentum pricing due to speculation regarding future appreciation in value leading to greater volatility which could adversely affect an investment in the shares momentum pricing typically is associated with growth stocks and other assets whose valuation as determined by the investing public accounts for anticipated future appreciation in value the bitcoin index price is determined using data from various bitcoin exchanges overthecounter markets and derivative platforms the sponsor believes that momentum pricing of bitcoins has resulted and may continue to result in speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoins inflating and making the bitcoin index price more volatile as a result bitcoins may be more likely to fluctuate in value due to changing investor confidence in future appreciation or depreciation in the bitcoin index price which could adversely affect an investment in the shares the index is an average composite reference rate calculated using volumeweighted trading price data from various bitcoin exchanges chosen by the index provider pricing on any bitcoin exchange in the bitcoin exchange market can be volatile and can adversely affect an investment in the shares the index has a limited history and is an average composite reference rate that is based on volumeweighted trading price data from various bitcoin exchanges chosen by the index provider the data inputs are drawn from the application programming interface of various bitcoin exchanges and includes trade time price and volume the index provider selects which bitcoin exchanges to include in the index based on currencydenomination liquidity and such other factors as the index provider may deem material for example availability of data the index provider reviews the eligibility of bitcoin exchanges periodically and not less frequently than quarterly as of the date of this prospectus the eligible bitcoin exchanges selected by the index provider include bitstamp gdax formerly known as coinbase exchange kraken and itbit the calculation of the index at  pm new york time on each business day will be used as the bitcoin index price for the calculation of the trusts bitcoin holdings see overview of the bitcoin industry and marketbitcoin value the price of bitcoins on public bitcoin exchanges has a limited history of less than seven years during such history bitcoin prices on the bitcoin exchange market as a whole and on bitcoin exchanges individually have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors including the levels of liquidity on bitcoin exchanges even the largest bitcoin exchanges have been subject to operational interruption limiting the liquidity of bitcoins on the bitcoin exchange market and resulting in volatile prices and a reduction in confidence in the bitcoin network and the bitcoin exchange market for example both okcoin and bitfinex were previously included in the index but have been removed due to operational difficulties effective february   okcoin was removed due to its implementation of a policy that currently suspends withdrawals from its exchange on april   bitfinex announced that it was having difficulty withdrawing fiat currencies from its taiwanese banks and as a result it stopped accepting incoming wires leading to volatility in the price of bitcoin on bitfinex on may   the index provider removed bitfinex from the index and added kraken the index is designed to have limited exposure to bitcoin exchange interruption by utilizing transaction data from the high volume us dollardenominated bitcoin exchanges measured over the prior hour period the index is also designed to limit exposure to trading or price distortion on bitcoin exchanges experiencing periods of unusual activity or limited liquidity by discounting in realtime anomalous price movement at individual exchanges the sponsor believes the index calculation methodology provides a more accurate picture of bitcoin price movements than a simple average of bitcoin exchange prices and that the inclusion of only the highest volume bitcoin exchanges during the calculation period limits the likelihood that included data is influenced by temporary price dislocations that may result from technical problems or limited liquidity on otherwise eligible exchanges the index provider periodically reviews which bitcoin exchanges are used to    table of contents calculate the bitcoin index price using considerations such as depth of liquidity compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements data availability us domicile and acceptance of us dollar deposits the price of bitcoins on public bitcoin exchanges may also be impacted by policies on or interruptions in the deposit or withdrawal of fiat currency into or out of larger bitcoin exchanges on large bitcoin exchanges users may buy or sell bitcoins for fiat currency or transfer bitcoins to other wallets operational limits including regulatory exchange policy or technical or operational limits on the size or settlement speed of fiat currency deposits by users into bitcoin exchanges may reduce demand on such bitcoin exchanges resulting in a reduction in the bitcoin price on such bitcoin exchange operational limits including regulatory exchange policy or technical or operational limits on the size or settlement speed of fiat currency withdrawals by users from bitcoin exchanges may reduce supply on such bitcoin exchanges resulting in an increase in the bitcoin price on such bitcoin exchange to the extent that fees for the transfer of bitcoins either directly or indirectly occur between bitcoin exchanges the impact on bitcoin prices of operational limits on fiat currency deposits and withdrawals may be reduced by exchange shopping among bitcoin exchange users for example a delay in us dollar withdrawals on one site may temporarily increase the price on such site by reducing supply ie sellers transferring bitcoins to another exchange without operational limits in order to settle sales more rapidly but the resulting increase in price will also reduce demand because bidders on bitcoins will follow increased supply on other bitcoin exchanges not experiencing operational limits to the extent that users are able or willing to utilize or arbitrage prices between more than one bitcoin exchange exchange shopping may mitigate the shortterm impact on and volatility of bitcoin prices due to operational limits on the deposit or withdrawal of fiat currency into or out of larger bitcoin exchanges despite efforts to ensure accurate pricing on a volumeweighted basis the bitcoin index price and the price of bitcoins generally remains subject to volatility experienced by the bitcoin exchanges such volatility can adversely affect an investment in the shares due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of bitcoin exchanges the marketplace may lose confidence in bitcoin exchanges upon which the trust is dependent the bitcoin exchanges on which the bitcoins trade are relatively new and in some cases unregulated furthermore while many prominent bitcoin exchanges provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure management teams corporate practices and regulatory compliance many bitcoin exchanges including several us dollar denominated bitcoin exchanges and many chinese yuan denominated bitcoin exchanges do not provide this information as a result the marketplace may lose confidence in bitcoin exchanges including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of bitcoin trading the trusts bitcoin holdings is determined using the bitcoin index price as represented by the index as of  pm new york time on the valuation date the index utilizes data from bitcoin exchanges selected by the index provider to determine the weighted average price for bitcoins for a further discussion of the bitcoin exchange market and the selection of bitcoin exchanges for inclusion in the indexs calculation of bitcoin prices see overview of the bitcoin industry and marketbitcoin value and uses of bitcoins over the past seven years some bitcoin exchanges have been closed due to fraud business failure or security breaches in many of these instances the customers of such bitcoin exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances in such bitcoin exchanges while smaller bitcoin exchanges are less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that make larger bitcoin exchanges more stable larger bitcoin exchanges are more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and malware and may be more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action for example in august  it was reported that almost  bitcoins worth around  million were stolen from bitfinex a large bitcoin exchange the value of bitcoin immediately decreased over  following reports of the theft at bitfinex and the shares suffered a corresponding decrease in value additionally in january  bitstamp announced that approximately  bitcoin had been stolen from its operational or hot wallets further the collapse of mt gox which filed for bankruptcy protection in japan in late february  indicated that even the largest bitcoin    table of contents exchanges could be subject to abrupt failure with consequences for both users of a bitcoin exchange and the bitcoin industry as a whole in particular in the two weeks that followed the february   halt of bitcoin withdrawals from mt gox the value of one bitcoin fell on other exchanges from around  on february   to  on february   a lack of stability in the bitcoin exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of bitcoin exchanges due to fraud business failure hackers or malware or governmentmandated regulation may reduce confidence in the bitcoin network and result in greater volatility in the bitcoin index price furthermore the closure or temporary shutdown of a bitcoin exchange used in calculating the bitcoin index price may result in a loss of confidence in the trusts ability to determine its bitcoin holdings on a daily basis these potential consequences of a bitcoin exchanges failure could adversely affect an investment in the shares since there is no limit on the number of bitcoins that the trust may acquire the trust itself as it grows may have an impact on the supply and demand of bitcoins that ultimately may affect the price of the shares in a manner unrelated to other factors affecting the global market for bitcoins the trust agreement places no limit on the number of bitcoins the trust may hold moreover the trust may issue an unlimited number of shares subject to registration requirements and therefore acquire an unlimited number of bitcoins in existence at any point in time the global market for bitcoins is characterized by supply and demand constraints that generally are not present in the markets for commodities or other assets such as gold and silver the bitcoin networks mathematical protocols under which bitcoins are created or mined permit the creation of a limited predetermined number of bitcoins not to exceed  million furthermore the rate of creation or issuance of bitcoins cannot be increased ahead of the protocols schedule as of april   approximately  million bitcoins had been created if the number of bitcoins acquired by the trust is large enough relative to global bitcoin supply and demand further creations and redemptions of shares could have an impact on the supply of and demand for bitcoins in a manner unrelated to other factors affecting the global market for bitcoins such an impact could affect the bitcoin index price which would directly affect the price at which shares are traded on nyse arca or the price of future baskets created or redeemed by the trust as of march   the trust held a closing balance of  bitcoins that it acquired in the sale of baskets representing approximately  of the total bitcoins in existence the trust and the sponsor cannot provide any assurance that increased bitcoin holdings by the trust in the future will have no longterm impact on the bitcoin index price thereby affecting share trading prices the shares may trade at a discount or premium in the trading price relative to the trusts bitcoin holdings per share as a result of nonconcurrent trading hours between nyse arca and the bitcoin exchange market the value of a share may be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between nyse arca and various bitcoin exchanges including those that represent components of the index while nyse arca is open for trading in the shares for a limited period each day the bitcoin exchange market is a hour marketplace however trading volume and liquidity on the bitcoin exchange market is not consistent throughout the day and bitcoin exchanges including the largervolume markets have been known to shut down temporarily or permanently due to security concerns directed denial of service attacks and ddos attacks and other reasons as a result during periods when nyse arca is open but large bitcoin exchanges or a substantial number of smaller bitcoin exchanges are either lightly traded or are closed trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and therefore increase the difference between the price of the shares and the trusts bitcoin holdings per share premiums or discounts may have an adverse effect on an investment in the shares if a shareholder sells or acquires its shares during a period of discount or premium respectively    table of contents if bitcoin prices on the exchange market move negatively during hours when nyse arca is closed trading prices on nyse arca may gap down at market open the value of a share may be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between nyse arca and various bitcoin exchanges including those that represent components of the index while nyse arca is open for trading in the shares for a limited period each day the bitcoin exchange market is a hour marketplace during periods when nyse arca is closed but bitcoin exchanges are open significant changes in the price of bitcoin on the exchange market could result in a difference in performance between the value of bitcoins as measured by the index and the most recent bitcoin holdings per share or closing trading price to the extent that the price of bitcoin on the exchange market and the value of bitcoins as measured by the index moves significantly in a negative direction after the close of nyse arca the trading price of the shares may gap down to the full extent of such negative price shift when nyse arca reopens to the extent that the price of bitcoin on the exchange market drops significantly during hours nyse arca is closed investors may not be able to sell their shares until after the gap down has been fully realized resulting in an inability to mitigate losses in a rapidly negative market a possible short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand for the shares that largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in the shares investors may purchase shares to hedge existing bitcoin or other digital currencies commodity or currency exposure or to speculate on the price of bitcoins speculation on the price of bitcoins may involve long and short exposures to the extent that aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares available for purchase for example in the event that large redemption requests by authorized participants dramatically affect share liquidity investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares for delivery to share lenders those repurchases may in turn dramatically increase the price of the shares until additional shares are created through the creation process this is often referred to as a short squeeze a short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in the shares that are not directly correlated to the price of bitcoins purchasing activity in the bitcoin exchange market associated with basket creations or selling activity following basket redemptions may affect the bitcoin index price and share trading prices adversely affecting an investment in the shares purchasing activity associated with acquiring bitcoins required for deposit with the trust in connection with the creation of baskets may increase the market price of bitcoins on the bitcoin exchange market which will result in higher prices for the shares increases in the market price of bitcoins may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants other market participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of bitcoins that may result from increased purchasing activity of bitcoins connected with the issuance of baskets consequently the market price of bitcoins may decline immediately after baskets are created selling activity associated with sales of bitcoins withdrawn from the trust in connection with the redemption of baskets may decrease the market price of bitcoins on the bitcoin exchange market which will result in lower prices for the shares decreases in the market price of bitcoins may also occur as a result of the selling activity of other market participants if the bitcoin index price declines the trading price of the shares will generally also decline an investment in the shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in bitcoins the trust competes with direct investments in bitcoins and other potential financial vehicles possibly including securities backed by or linked to bitcoins and digital currency financial vehicles similar to the trust market and financial conditions and other conditions beyond the sponsors control may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in bitcoins directly which could limit the market for the shares and reduce the liquidity of the shares    table of contents the bitcoin index price may be affected by the sale of other digital currency financial vehicles that invest in and track the price of bitcoins to the extent digital currency financial vehicles other than the trust tracking the price of bitcoins are formed and represent a significant proportion of the demand for bitcoins large redemptions of the securities of these digital currency financial vehicles or private funds holding bitcoins could negatively affect the bitcoin index price the trusts bitcoin holdings and the price of the shares the impact of geopolitical or economic events on the supply and demand for bitcoins is uncertain but could motivate largescale sales of bitcoins which could result in a reduction in the bitcoin index price and adversely affect an investment in the shares as an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments digital assets such as bitcoins which are relatively new are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative decentralized means of buying and selling goods and services and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events nevertheless political or economic crises may motivate largescale acquisitions or sales of bitcoins either globally or locally largescale sales of bitcoins would result in a reduction in the bitcoin index price and could adversely affect an investment in the shares demand for bitcoins is driven in part by its status as the most prominent and secure digital asset it is possible that a digital asset other than bitcoins could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base resulting in a reduction in demand for bitcoins which could have a negative impact on the price of bitcoins and adversely affect an investment in the shares the bitcoin network and bitcoins as an asset hold a firsttomarket advantage over other digital assets this firsttomarket advantage is driven in large part by having the largest user base and more importantly the largest combined mining power in use to secure the blockchain and transaction verification system see overview of the bitcoin industry and marketcryptographic security used in the bitcoin network having a large mining network results in greater user confidence regarding the security and longterm stability of a digital assets network and its blockchain as a result the advantage of more users and miners makes a digital asset more secure which makes it more attractive to new users and miners resulting in a network effect that strengthens the firsttomarket advantage as of april   there were over  alternate digital assets or altcoins tracked by coinmarketcapcom having a total market capitalization including bitcoin of approximately  billion using market prices and total available supply of each digital asset according to coinmarketcapcoms calculations bitcoins represented approximately  of the total market capitalization of all digital assets as of april   bitcoins  billion market capitalization was approximately  times as large as the  billion market capitalization of ethereum the second largest digital currency by market capitalization and approximately  times larger than the  million market capitalization of ripple the third largest digital currency by market capitalization bitcoin also enjoys significantly greater acceptance and usage than other altcoin networks in the retail and commercial marketplace due in large part to the relatively wellfunded efforts of payment processing companies including bitpay and coinbase despite the marked firstmover advantage of the bitcoin network over other digital assets it is possible that an altcoin could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the bitcoin network protocol that is not immediately addressed by the core developers or a perceived advantage of an altcoin that includes features not incorporated into bitcoin if an altcoin obtains significant market share either in market capitalization mining power or use as a payment technology this could reduce bitcoins market share and have a negative impact on the demand for and price of bitcoins    table of contents risk factors related to the trust and the shares as the sponsor and its management have no meaningful history of operating an investment vehicle like the trust their experience may be inadequate or unsuitable to manage the trust the sponsor was formed to be the sponsor of the trust and has no meaningful history of past performance in managing investment vehicles like the trust the past performances of the sponsors management in other investment vehicles including their experiences in the bitcoin and venture capital industries are no indication of their ability to manage an investment vehicle such as the trust if the experience of the sponsor and its management is inadequate or unsuitable to manage an investment vehicle such as the trust the operations of the trust may be adversely affected the value of the shares could decrease if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise the mechanisms and procedures governing the creation redemption and offering of the shares and storage of the bitcoins have been developed specifically for this product there may be unanticipated problems or issues with respect to the mechanics of the trusts operations and the trading of the shares that could have an adverse effect on an investment in the shares in addition although the trust is not actively managed by traditional methods to the extent that unanticipated operational or trading problems or issues arise the sponsors past experience and qualifications may not be suitable for solving these problems or issues the shares may trade at a price which is at above or below the trusts bitcoin holdings per share and any discount or premium in the trading price relative to the trusts bitcoin holdings per share may widen as a result of nonconcurrent trading hours the shares may trade on nyse arca at above or below the trusts bitcoin holdings per share the trusts bitcoin holdings per share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the trusts assets the trading price of the shares will fluctuate in accordance with changes in the trusts bitcoin holdings per share as well as market supply and demand the price difference may be due in large part to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the public trading market for shares are closely related but not identical to the same forces influencing the bitcoin index price consequently an authorized participant may be able to create or redeem a basket of shares at a discount or a premium to the public trading price per share authorized participants or their clients or customers may have an opportunity to realize a riskless profit if they can create a basket at a discount to the public trading price of the shares or can redeem a basket at a premium over the public trading price of the shares the sponsor expects that the exploitation of such arbitrage opportunities by authorized participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track the bitcoin holdings per share closely over time such arbitrage opportunities will not be available to shareholders who are not authorized participants if authorized participants are able to purchase or sell large aggregations of bitcoins in the open market at prices that are different than the bitcoin index price the arbitrage mechanism intended to keep the price of the shares closely linked to the bitcoin index price may not function properly and the shares may trade at a discount or premium to the bitcoin holdings per share the arbitrage mechanism on which the trust relies to keep the price of the shares closely linked to the bitcoin index price may not function properly if authorized participants are able to purchase or sell large aggregations of bitcoins in the open market at prices that are materially higher or lower than the bitcoin index price authorized participants may purchase or sell bitcoins on public or private markets not included among the bitcoin exchanges included in the index and such transactions may take place at prices materially higher or lower than the bitcoin index price furthermore while the index provides a us dollardenominated composite reference rate for the price of bitcoin based on the volumeweighted price of a bitcoin on certain constituent bitcoin exchanges at any given time the prices on each individual bitcoin exchange are not necessarily equal to the value of a bitcoin as represented by the index    table of contents for example based on data provided by the index provider from may   to april   the maximum variance of the  pm new york time spot price of any single exchange included in the index from the bitcoin index price was  and the average maximum variance of the  pm new york time spot price of any single exchange from the bitcoin index price was  during this same period the average variance of the  pm new york time spot prices of all the exchanges included in the index from the bitcoin index price was  the timeframe chosen reflects the longest continuous period during which the four bitcoin exchanges that are currently included in the index have been constituents all bitcoin exchanges that were included in the index throughout the period were considered in this analysis further based on data provided by the index provider for the same period the maximum variance of the  pm new york time spot price on any single us dollar denominated exchange with the eight highest trading volumes from the bitcoin index price was  and the average maximum variance of the  pm new york time spot price of any single exchange from the bitcoin index price was  during the same period the average variance of the  pm new york time spot price of the us dollar denominated exchanges with the eight highest trading volumes from the bitcoin index price was  although the average price variance between the bitcoin index price and the price of bitcoins on the bitcoin exchanges both individually and as a group has historically been immaterial the price of bitcoins on an individual bitcoin exchange has historically and could in the future be materially higher or lower than the bitcoin index price under either such circumstance the arbitrage mechanism will function to link the price of the shares to the prices at which authorized participants are able to purchase or sell large aggregations of bitcoins to the extent such prices differ materially from the bitcoin index price the price of the shares may no longer track whether temporarily or over time the bitcoin index price which could adversely affect an investment in the trust by reducing investors confidence in the shares ability to track the market price of bitcoins and the bitcoin index price if the processes of creation and redemption of baskets encounter any unanticipated difficulties the opportunities for arbitrage transactions intended to keep the price of the shares closely linked to the bitcoin index price may not exist and as a result the price of the shares may fall if the creation and redemption of the shares which depend on timely transfers of bitcoins to and from the custody accounts maintained by the custodian encounter any unanticipated difficulties including but not limited to the trusts inability in the future to obtain regulatory approvals for the offer and sale of additional shares after the present offering is completed potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the shares and the price of the underlying bitcoins may not take the risk that as a result of those difficulties they may not be able to realize the profit they expect if this is the case the liquidity of shares may decline and the price of the shares may fluctuate independently of the bitcoin index price and may fall the postponement suspension or rejection of creation or redemption orders may adversely affect an investment in the shares under the trust agreement the sponsor may suspend or reject creation or redemption orders as applicable for a variety of permitted reasons under certain circumstances to the extent such orders are suspended or rejected the arbitrage mechanism resulting from the process through which authorized participants create and redeem shares directly with the trust may fail to closely link the price of the shares to the value of the underlying bitcoins as measured using the bitcoin index price if this is the case the liquidity of the shares may decline and the price of the shares may fluctuate independently of the bitcoin index price and may fall furthermore the placement of incash creation and redemption orders require additional administrative steps as compared to inkind creation and redemption orders which could hinder arbitrage opportunities for incash creation and redemption orders the sponsor administrator or marketing agents failure to quickly execute such administrative steps could cause a delay in the execution of an authorized participants order    table of contents which could hinder an authorized participants ability to arbitrage the difference between the bitcoin index price and the price of the shares thereby impacting an authorized participants ability to keep the price of the shares closely linked to the bitcoin index price see description of creation and redemption of shares the trust could experience unforeseen difficulties in operating and maintaining key elements of its technical infrastructure the bitcoin account has been designed specifically to provide security for the trusts assets and may be expanded updated and altered from time to time any effort to expand update or alter the security system is likely to be complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects may lead to unanticipated project costs operational inefficiencies or vulnerabilities to security breaches in addition there may be problems with the design or implementation of the bitcoin account or with an expansion or upgrade thereto that are not evident during the testing phases of design and implementation and that may only become apparent after the trust has utilized the infrastructure any issues relating to the performance and effectiveness of the security procedures used by the trust and the custodian to protect the bitcoin account such as algorithms codes passwords multiple signature systems encryption and telephone callbacks together the security procedures may have an adverse impact on an investment in the shares the security procedures implemented by the custodian are technical and complex and the trust depends on the security procedures to protect the storage acceptance and distribution of data relating to bitcoins and the digital wallets into which the trust deposits its bitcoins the security procedures may not protect against all errors software flaws ie bugs or vulnerabilities defects in the security procedures may only be discovered after a failure in the custodians safekeeping and storage of the trusts bitcoins it is not uncommon for businesses in the bitcoin space to experience large losses due to fraud and breaches of their security systems for example in september  the global bitcoin payment agent bitpay lost approximately  million of bitcoins due to a hackers fraudulent impersonation of bitpays cfo whereby the hacker was able to access the cfos email account and successfully request bitpays custodian to transfer funds furthermore the trusts private keys required to transfer the trusts bitcoins are stored in vaults located across the world including but not limited to the united states europe including switzerland and south america which could be subject to i hostile regulatory treatment of bitcoin ii unforeseen social economic or political unrest and iii natural or manmade disaster for example one of the custodians vaults is located in a south american country that could be considered to have an elevated risk of hostile regulatory treatment and social economic or political unrest including high rates of inflation and general economic mismanagement if a vault were compromised it could cause a possible delay in operations of up to  hours which could have a negative impact on the value of the shares the trusts and the custodians ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends poses a challenge to the safekeeping of the trusts bitcoins bitcoin exchanges and large holders of bitcoins must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard client accounts while the sponsor believes the security procedures in place have been reasonably designed to safeguard the trusts bitcoins from theft loss destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack such assessment is based upon known technology and threats as technological change occurs the security threats to the trusts bitcoins will likely adapt and previously unknown threats may emerge furthermore the sponsor believes that the trust may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of the trusts assets grows to the extent that the trust or the custodian is unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats the trusts bitcoins may be subject to theft loss destruction or other attack which could have a negative impact on the performance of the shares or result in loss of the trusts assets    table of contents security threats to the bitcoin account could result in the halting of trust operations the suspension of redemptions and a loss of trust assets or damage to the reputation of the trust each of which could result in a reduction in the price of the shares security breaches computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the bitcoin exchange market since the launch of the bitcoin network any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data software hardware or other computer equipment and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm the trusts business operations or result in loss of the trusts assets any breach of the trusts infrastructure could result in damage to the trusts reputation and reduce demand for the shares resulting in a reduction in the price of the shares furthermore the sponsor believes that as the trusts assets grow it may become a more appealing target for security threats such as hackers and malware the sponsor believes that the security procedures that the sponsor and custodian utilize such as hardware redundancy segregation and offline data storage ie the maintenance of data on computers andor storage media that is not directly connected to or accessible from the internet andor networked with other computers also known as cold storage protocols are reasonably designed to safeguard the trusts bitcoins from theft loss destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack nevertheless the security procedures cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach software defect or act of god that may be borne by the trust absent gross negligence willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the sponsor the custodian or their agents the security procedures and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties error or malfeasance of an employee of the sponsor or custodian or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to the bitcoin account private keys data or bitcoins additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of the custodian or the sponsor to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the trusts infrastructure as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target the sponsor may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of the bitcoin account occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of the trust could be harmed which could result in a reduction in the price of the shares in the event of a security breach of the bitcoin account the trust may cease operations suspend redemptions or suffer a reduction in assets the occurrence of each of which could result in a reduction in the price of the shares a loss of confidence or breach in the trusts security and technology policies may adversely affect the trust and the value of an investment in the shares the trust sponsor custodian and each of their agents will take measures to protect the trust and its bitcoins from unauthorized access damage or theft however it is possible that the security procedures in place may not prevent the improper access to or damage or theft of the trusts bitcoins a security breach could harm the trusts reputation or result in the loss of some or all of the trusts bitcoins which represent the trusts only asset a resulting perception that the security procedures do not adequately protect the trusts bitcoins could result in a loss of current or potential shareholders reducing demand for and price of the shares bitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoins may be irretrievable as a result any incorrectly executed bitcoin transactions could adversely affect an investment in the shares bitcoin transactions are not reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an    table of contents incorrect transfer of bitcoins or a theft of bitcoins generally will not be reversible and the trust may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft although the trusts transfers of bitcoins will regularly be made to or from the bitcoin account it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the trusts bitcoins could be transferred from the trust custody account in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or to uncontrolled accounts for example in september  the chinese bitcoin exchange huobi announced that it had sent approximately  bitcoins and  litecoins worth approximately  at the prevailing market prices at the time to the wrong customers although it claimed that many customers returned the bitcoins and litecoins to the extent that the trust is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received the trusts bitcoins through error or theft the trust will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred trust bitcoins the trust will also be unable to convert or recover trust bitcoins transferred to uncontrolled accounts to the extent that the trust is unable to seek redress for such error or theft such loss could adversely affect an investment in the shares the trusts bitcoins may be subject to loss damage theft or restriction on access there is a risk that some or all of the trusts bitcoins could be lost stolen or destroyed the sponsor believes that the trusts bitcoins held in the bitcoin account will be an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy damage or steal the trusts bitcoins although the custodian uses security procedures with various elements such as redundancy segregation and cold storage to minimize the risk of loss damage and theft neither the custodian nor the sponsor can guarantee the prevention of such loss damage or theft whether caused intentionally accidentally or by an act of god access to the trusts bitcoins could also be restricted by natural events such as an earthquake or flood or human actions such as a terrorist attack any of these events may adversely affect the operations of the trust and consequently an investment in the shares the shareholders limited rights of legal recourse against the trust trustee sponsor transfer agent administrator and custodian expose the trust and its shareholders to the risk of loss of the trusts bitcoins for which no person is liable shareholders recourse against the trust trustee custodian and sponsor under new york law governing their custody operations is limited similarly the shareholders recourse against the sponsor the transfer agent and the administrator for the services they provide to the trust including those relating to the provision of instructions relating to the movement of bitcoins is limited consequently a loss may be suffered with respect to the trusts bitcoins for which no person is liable in damages further there is no thirdparty insurance to cover any loss that may be suffered with respect to the trusts bitcoins bitcoins held by the trust are not subject to fdic or sipc protections the trust is not a banking institution or otherwise a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or securities investor protection corporation sipc and therefore deposits held with or assets held by the trust are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with fdic or sipc member institutions the undivided interests in the trusts bitcoins represented by shares in the trust are not insured directly by the trustee or the sponsor the custodians limited liability under the custodian agreement may impair the ability of the trust to recover losses relating to its bitcoins and any recovery may be limited even in the event of fraud to the market value of the bitcoins at the time the fraud is discovered under the custodian agreement the custodians liability is limited to the greater of i the market value of the custodial coins at the time the events giving rise to the liability occurred and ii the fair market value of the custodial coins at the time that the custodian notifies the sponsor or trustee in writing or the sponsor or the trustee otherwise has actual knowledge of the events giving rise to the liability    table of contents in addition the custodian will not be liable for any delay in performance or any nonperformance of any of its custodial obligations under the trust agreement or any authorized participant selfadministered agreement by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control including acts of god war or terrorism the custodian will also not be liable for any system failure or thirdparty penetration of the bitcoin account unless such system failure or thirdparty penetration is the result of gross negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the custodian as a result the recourse of the trust or the shareholder under new york law is limited the trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its bitcoins are lost stolen or destroyed if the trusts bitcoins are lost stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the trust the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the trusts claim for example as to a particular event of loss the only source of recovery for the trust might be limited to the custodian or to the extent identifiable other responsible third parties for example a thief or terrorist any of which may not have the financial resources including liability insurance coverage to satisfy a valid claim of the trust the liquidity of the shares may be affected if authorized participants or liquidity providers cease to perform their obligations under the participant agreements in the event that one or more authorized participants having substantial interests in shares or otherwise responsible for a significant portion of the shares daily trading volume on nyse arca terminates its participant agreement the liquidity of the shares would likely decrease which could adversely affect the market price of and an investment in the shares in addition if one or more liquidity providers refuses or is unable to perform its obligations under its participant agreements the trust may have difficulty maintaining the participation of certain authorized participants or engaging additional authorized participants under such circumstances the liquidity of the shares would likely decrease which could adversely affect the market price of and an investment in the shares there is no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will continue to develop prior to this offering the shares traded on the overthecounter exchange otcqx there can be no assurance an active trading market of the shares will develop on nyse arca the sponsor may elect to terminate the trust if it determines in its sole discretion that the trust is not an economically viable size which could result in the liquidation of the trusts bitcoins at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders to the extent that nyse arca halts trading in the shares whether on a temporary or permanent basis investors may not be able to buy or sell shares thus adversely affecting an investment in the shares if an active trading market for the shares does not exist or continue to exist the market prices and liquidity of the shares may be adversely affected the trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders if the trust is required to terminate and liquidate such termination and liquidation could occur at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders such as when the bitcoin index price is lower than it was at the time when shareholders purchased their shares in such a case when the trusts bitcoins are sold as part of the trusts liquidation the resulting proceeds distributed to shareholders will be less than if the bitcoin index price were higher at the time of sale see description of the trust documentsdescription of the trust agreementthe trusteetermination of the trust for more information about the termination of the trust including when the termination of the trust may be triggered by events outside the direct control of the sponsor the trustee or the shareholders    table of contents the trust agreement includes a provision that restricts the right of a beneficial owner of a statutory trust from bringing a derivative action under delaware law the right of a beneficial owner of a statutory trust such as a shareholder of the trust to bring a derivative action ie to initiate a lawsuit in the name of a the statutory trust in order to assert a claim belonging to the statutory trust against a fiduciary of the statutory trust or against a thirdparty when the statutory trusts management has refused to do so may be restricted by the terms of the governing instrument of the statutory trust the trust agreement provides that in addition to any other requirements of applicable law no shareholder shall have the right power or authority to bring or maintain a derivative action suit or other proceeding on behalf of the trust unless two or more shareholders who i are not affiliates of one another and ii collectively hold at least  of the outstanding shares join in the bringing or maintaining of such action suit or other proceeding therefore the trust agreement limits the likelihood that a shareholder could successfully assert a derivative action the administrator is solely responsible for determining the value of the bitcoins and any errors discontinuance or changes in such valuation calculations may have an adverse effect on the value of the shares the administrator will determine the trusts bitcoin holdings and bitcoin holdings per share on a daily basis as soon as practicable after  pm new york time on each business day the administrators determination is made utilizing data from the custodians operations and the bitcoin index price calculated at  pm new york time on such day to the extent that the trusts bitcoin holdings or bitcoin holdings per share are incorrectly calculated the administrator may not be liable for any error and such misreporting of valuation data could adversely affect an investment in the shares extraordinary expenses resulting from unanticipated events may become payable by the trust adversely affecting an investment in the shares in consideration for the sponsors fee the sponsor has contractually assumed the sponsorassumed fees which are certain operational and periodic expenses of the trust see activities of the trusttrust expenses extraordinary expenses of the trust for example expenses relating to litigation are not assumed by the sponsor and are instead borne by the trust and paid through the sale of the trusts bitcoins because the trust does not generate any income every time that it delivers bitcoins to the sponsor for the sponsors fee or sells bitcoins for the additional trust expenses the number of bitcoins represented by each share will gradually decrease over time in addition the sponsor may in its sole discretion increase the sponsors fee or decrease the sponsorpaid expenses which could result in a greater decline in the number of bitcoins that the trust holds such an increase in the sponsors fee or decrease in the sponsorpaid expenses could occur if the expenses of the trust materially increase alternatively the sponsor could choose to decrease the sponsors fee in response to competitive pressures from other digital currency financial vehicles similar to the trust the sponsor will balance such competitive pressures and the costs that it incurs in acting as sponsor for the trust when determining the sponsors fee the trusts delivery or sale of bitcoins to pay expenses or other operations of the trust could result in shareholders incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the trust assuming that the trust is treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes each delivery of bitcoins by the trust to pay the sponsors fee or other expenses and each sale of bitcoins by the trust to pay additional trust expenses will be a taxable event to shareholders thus the trusts payment of expenses could result in shareholders incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the trust any such tax liability could adversely affect an investment in the shares see us federal income tax consequences    table of contents if the trust incurs extraordinary expenses in us dollars the trust will sell bitcoins to pay these expenses the sale of the trusts bitcoins to pay expenses at a time of low bitcoin prices could adversely affect the value of the shares the sponsor will sell bitcoins held by the trust to pay trust expenses not assumed by the sponsor on an asneeded basis irrespective of thencurrent bitcoin prices on the bitcoin exchange market the trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of bitcoins consequently if the trust incurs expenses in us dollars the trusts bitcoins may be sold at a time when the bitcoin prices on the bitcoin exchange market are low resulting in a negative impact on the value of the shares the value of the shares will be adversely affected if the trust is required to indemnify the sponsor the trustee the transfer agent the administrator or the custodian under the trust documents under the trust documents each of the sponsor the trustee the transfer agent the administrator and the custodian has a right to be indemnified by the trust for certain liabilities or expenses that it incurs without gross negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on its part therefore the sponsor trustee transfer agent the administrator or custodian may require that the assets of the trust be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it any sale of that kind would reduce the trusts bitcoin holdings and the value of the shares intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the trust and an investment in the shares the sponsor is not aware of any intellectual property rights claims that may prevent the trust from operating and holding bitcoins however third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims relating to the operation of the trust and the mechanics instituted for the investment in holding of and transfer of bitcoins regardless of the merit of an intellectual property or other legal action any legal expenses to defend or payments to settle such claims would be additional trust expenses and be borne by the trust through the sale of the trusts bitcoins additionally a meritorious intellectual property rights claim could prevent the trust from operating and force the sponsor to terminate the trust and liquidate the trusts bitcoins as a result an intellectual property rights claim against the trust could adversely affect an investment in the shares risk factors related to the regulation of the trust and the shares shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the investment company act or the protections afforded by the cea the investment company act is designed to protect investors by preventing insiders from managing investment companies to their benefit and to the detriment of public investors such as the issuance of securities having inequitable or discriminatory provisions the management of investment companies by irresponsible persons the use of unsound or misleading methods of computing earnings and asset value changes in the character of investment companies without the consent of investors and investment companies from engaging in excessive leveraging to accomplish these ends the investment company act requires the safekeeping and proper valuation of fund assets restricts greatly transactions with affiliates limits leveraging and imposes governance requirements as a check on fund management the trust is not registered as an investment company under the investment company act and the sponsor believes that the trust is not required to register under such act consequently shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies the trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the cea as administered by the cftc furthermore the sponsor believes that the trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the cea and that neither the sponsor nor the trustee is subject to regulation by the cftc as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the operation of the trust consequently shareholders will not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in cearegulated instruments or commodity pools    table of contents the trust and an affiliate of the trust recently entered into a settlement agreement with the sec concerning the operation of the trusts former redemption program on april   a program was launched pursuant to which shareholders could request redemptions from genesis an affiliate of the trust and the sole authorized participant at that time on september   genesis received a letter from the staff of the secs office of compliance inspections and examinations summarizing the staffs findings from an onsite review of genesiss brokerdealer activities conducted in june  in its exit report the staff stated that it had concluded that the trusts redemption program in which shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their shares through genesis appeared to violate regulation m under the exchange act because such redemptions of shares took place at the same time the trust was in the process of creating shares on july   genesis and the trust entered into a settlement agreement with the sec whereby they agreed to a ceaseanddesist order against future violations of rules  and  of regulation m under the exchange act genesis also agreed to pay disgorgement of  in redemption fees it collected plus prejudgment interest of  for a total of  the trust is seeking an exemption from the sec under regulation m in order to reinstate its redemption program but cannot at this time predict whether it will be successful in obtaining such regulatory relief regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in the shares or restrict the use of bitcoins or the operation of the bitcoin network or the bitcoin exchange market in a manner that adversely affects an investment in the shares as bitcoins have grown in both popularity and market size the us congress and a number of us federal and state agencies including fincen sec cftc finra the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the department of justice the department of homeland security the federal bureau of investigation the irs and state financial institution regulators have been examining the bitcoin network bitcoin users and the bitcoin exchange market with particular focus on the extent to which bitcoins can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service providers that hold bitcoins for users many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by bitcoins to investors ongoing and future regulatory actions may alter perhaps to a materially adverse extent the nature of an investment in the shares or the ability of the trust to continue to operate in  guidance fincen took the position that any administrator or exchanger of convertible digital currencies including bitcoins must register with fincen as a money transmitter and must comply with the antimoney laundering regulations applicable to money transmitters fincen subsequently issued several interpretive letters clarifying which entities would be considered administrators or exchangers and which would be considered mere users not subject to registration the requirement that bitcoin exchangers that do business in the us register with fincen and comply with antimoney laundering regulations may increase the cost of buying and selling bitcoins and therefore may adversely affect their price in  the nydfs finalized a rule that requires most businesses involved in digital currency business activity in or involving new york excluding merchants and consumers to apply for a license commonly known as a bitlicense from the nydfs and to comply with antimoney laundering cyber security consumer protection and financial and reporting requirements among others as an alternative to the bitlicense in new york firms can apply for a charter to become limited purpose trust companies qualified to engage in digital currency business activity other states have considered regimes similar to the bitlicense for example a bill in california would have imposed a similar regime although the bill was shelved or have required digital currency businesses to register with their states as money transmitters such as washington and georgia which results in digital currency businesses being subject to requirements similar to those of nydfs bitlicense regime certain state regulators such as the texas department of banking kansas office of the state bank commissioner and the illinois department of financial and professional regulation have found that mere transmission of bitcoin without activities involving transmission of fiat currency does not constitute money transmission requiring    table of contents licensure the north carolina commissioner of banks has issued guidance providing that north carolinas money transmission regulations only apply to the transmission of digital currency and not its use the inconsistency in applying money transmitting licensure requirements to certain bitcoin businesses may make it more difficult for bitcoin businesses to provide services which may affect consumer adoption of bitcoin and its price to date the sec has not asserted regulatory authority over the bitcoin network or bitcoin trading or ownership and has not expressed the view that digital currencies including bitcoin should be classified or treated as securities for purposes of us federal securities laws however the sec has commented on bitcoin and bitcoinrelated market developments and has taken action against investment schemes involving bitcoin for example in the secs recent review of proposed rule changes to list and trade shares of certain bitcoinrelated investment vehicles on public markets they have stated that the bitcoin markets are not properly regulated the sec asserts that this results in the public markets inability to enter into surveillancesharing agreements that help address concerns regarding fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices if the sec were to determine that bitcoin is a security the trust and the sponsor would be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements under us federal securities laws including the investment company act and with respect to the sponsor the investment advisers act the cftc treats bitcoin and other digital currencies as commodities under the cea thereby asserting jurisdiction over futures swaps and other cftcregulated derivatives that reference digital currencies the cftc has not to date taken the view that bitcoin is a commodity interest which is defined under the cea to include futures swaps and other derivatives based on commodities commodity interests are subject to cftc regulation and thus if bitcoin were to be deemed a commodity interest by the cftc the trust and the sponsor would be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements under the cea and cftc regulations to the extent that future regulatory actions or policies limit the ability to exchange bitcoins or utilize them for payments the demand for bitcoins will be reduced and authorized participants may not seek to redeem redemption baskets in exchange for redemption proceeds in bitcoins furthermore regulatory actions may limit the ability of endusers to convert bitcoins into fiat currency for example us dollars or use bitcoins to pay for goods and services such regulatory actions or policies would result in a reduction of demand and in turn the bitcoin index price and the price of the shares bitcoins currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions such as the european union china japan and russia while certain governments such as germany where the ministry of finance has declared digital currencies such as bitcoins to be rechnungseinheiten a form of private money that is recognized as a unit of account but not recognized in the same manner as fiat currency have issued guidance as to how to treat bitcoins most regulatory bodies have not yet issued official statements regarding their intention to regulate or determinations on regulation of bitcoins bitcoin users and the bitcoin network in october  the european court of justice ruled that bitcoin transactions throughout the european union should be treated as a traditional currency transactions and not be subject to valueadded tax in april  her majestys treasury announced its plan to apply the united kingdoms antimoney laundering regulations to digital currency exchange firms but not to wallet services that do not offer fiattodigital exchange functionality in april  the russian regulators indicated their plan to recognize bitcoin and other digital currencies as a legitimate financial instrument by  as part of the governments broader efforts to tackle money laundering standing in sharp contrast with the governments previous attempts to ban the conversion of bitcoin and other money surrogates into fiat currency and impose criminal penalties for such violations in china a december  government notice classified bitcoins as virtual commodities and not legal tender the same notice restricted the existing banking and payment industries from using bitcoin limiting the scope of the operations of bitcoin exchanges in one of the largest bitcoin markets in january  in response to informal guidance received from the peoples bank of china the pboc concerning the creation of tighter antimoney laundering and foreign exchange controls the largest chinabased bitcoin exchangesbtcc    table of contents huobi and okcoinadjusted their terms to pause or limit loan and borrowing services these three exchanges later introduced a  fixedrate transaction fee for all bitcoin buy and sell orders with similar measures soon adopted by many of chinas smaller bitcoin exchanges bitcoin withdrawals have also been halted on btcc huobi and okcoin in march  the pboc reaffirmed its commitment to regulating bitcoin exchanges and indicated the possibility of licensing a number of qualified exchanges these events have substantially reduced trading volume on chinese exchanges in  the australian government announced its plan to update its antimoney laundering laws to apply to digital currency exchanges following an inquiry by the government into the countrys tax treatment and regulation of bitcoin in japan regulations went into effect in april  that recognize digital currencies as a legal method of payment and require market participants including exchanges to meet certain compliance requirements and be subject to oversight by the financial services agency a japanese regulator the government of israel and the israel tax authority decided in january  to apply capital gains tax to sales of bitcoins and other digital currencies conversely regulatory bodies in some countries such as india have declined to exercise regulatory authority when afforded the opportunity at the other extreme in  ecuador bolivia and bangladesh banned the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies various foreign jurisdictions may in the near future adopt laws regulations or directives that affect the bitcoin network the bitcoin exchange market and their users particularly bitcoin exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions regulatory scope such laws regulations or directives may conflict with those of the united states and may negatively impact the acceptance of bitcoins by users merchants and service providers outside the united states and may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of the bitcoin economy in the european union china japan russia and the united states and globally or otherwise negatively affect the value of bitcoins additionally us state and federal and foreign regulators and legislatures have taken action against virtual currency businesses or enacted restrictive regimes in response to adverse publicity arising from hacks consumer harm or criminal activity stemming from virtual currency activity the value of bitcoins could thus be impacted by such adverse publicity if regulatory changes or interpretations of an authorized participant or liquidity providers activities require the regulation of an authorized participant or liquidity provider as a money service business under the regulations promulgated by fincen under the authority of the us bank secrecy act or as a money transmitter or virtual currency business under state regimes for the licensing of such businesses an authorized participant or liquidity provider may be required to register and comply with such regulations which could result in extraordinary recurring andor nonrecurring expenses to the authorized participant or liquidity provider or increased commissions for the authorized participant or liquidity providers clients thereby reducing the liquidity of the trust to the extent that the activities of an authorized participant or liquidity provider cause it to be deemed a money services business under the regulations promulgated by fincen under the authority of the us bank secrecy act an authorized participant or liquidity provider may be required to comply with fincen regulations including those that would mandate an authorized participant or liquidity provider to implement antimoney laundering programs make certain reports to fincen and maintain certain records similarly the activities of an authorized participant or liquidity provider may require it to be licensed as a money transmitter or as a virtual currency business such as under nydfss bitlicense scheme such additional regulatory obligations may cause the authorized participant or liquidity provider to incur extraordinary expenses possibly increasing the levels of the commissions that an authorized participant or liquidity provider charges its clients in a material and adverse manner if an authorized participant or liquidity provider determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements an authorized participant or liquidity provider may terminate its role as an authorized participant or liquidity provider of the trust such a termination may decrease the liquidity of the trust    table of contents additionally to the extent an authorized participant or liquidity provider is found to have operated without appropriate state or federal licenses it may be subject to investigation administrative or court proceedings and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties all of which would harm the reputation of the trust or its sponsor decrease the liquidity of the trust and have a material adverse effect on the price of the shares banks may not provide banking services or may cut off banking services to businesses that provide bitcoinrelated services or that accept bitcoin as payment which could damage the public perception of bitcoin and the utility of bitcoin as a payment system and could decrease the price of bitcoins and adversely affect an investment in the shares a number of companies that provide bitcoinrelated services have been unable to find banks that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and banking services similarly a number of such companies have had their existing bank accounts closed by their banks banks may refuse to provide bank accounts and other banking services to bitcoinrelated companies or companies that accept bitcoin for a number of reasons such as perceived compliance risks or costs the difficulty that many businesses that provide bitcoinrelated services have and may continue to have in finding banks willing to provide them with bank accounts and other banking services may be currently decreasing the usefulness of bitcoin as a payment system and harming public perception of bitcoin or could decrease its usefulness and harm its public perception in the future similarly the usefulness of bitcoin as a payment system and the public perception of bitcoin could be damaged if banks were to close the accounts of many or of a few key businesses providing bitcoinrelated services this could decrease the price of bitcoins and therefore adversely affect an investment in the shares it may be illegal now or in the future to acquire own hold sell or use bitcoins in one or more countries and ownership of holding or trading in shares may also be considered illegal and subject to sanctions the united states china russia or other jurisdictions may take regulatory actions in the future that severely restrict the right to acquire own hold sell or use bitcoins or to exchange bitcoins for fiat currency such an action may also result in the restriction of ownership holding or trading in the shares such a restriction could subject the trust or its sponsor to investigations civil or criminal fines and penalties which could harm the reputation of the trust or its sponsor and could result in the termination and liquidation of the trust at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders or may adversely affect an investment in the shares if regulatory changes or interpretations of the trusts or sponsors activities require registration as money service businesses under the regulations promulgated by fincen under the authority of the us bank secrecy act or as money transmitters or digital currency businesses under state regimes for the licensing of such businesses the trust andor sponsor could suffer reputational harm and also extraordinary recurring andor nonrecurring expenses which would adversely impact an investment in the shares if regulatory changes or interpretations of the trusts or sponsors activities require the registration of the trust or sponsor as a money services business under the regulations promulgated by fincen under the authority of the us bank secrecy act the trust or sponsor may be required to register and comply with such regulations if regulatory changes or interpretations of the trusts or sponsors activities require the licensing or other registration as a money transmitter or business engaged in digital currency activity eg under the new york bitlicense regime or equivalent designation under state law in any state in which the trust or sponsor operates the trust or sponsor may be required to seek licensure or otherwise register and comply with such state law in the event of any such requirement to the extent that the sponsor decides to continue the trust the required registrations licensure and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary nonrecurring expenses to the trust regulatory compliance would include among other things implementing antimoney laundering and consumer protection programs the sponsor may also decide to terminate the trust any termination of the trust in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders    table of contents to the extent the trust or its sponsor is found to have operated without appropriate state or federal licenses it may be subject to investigation administrative or court proceedings and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties all of which would harm the reputation of the trust or its sponsor decrease the

and adverse manner furthermore the trust and its service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to money service businesses money transmitters and businesses involved in digital currency business activity if the sponsor determines not to comply with such requirements the sponsor will act to dissolve and liquidate the trust any such termination could result in the liquidation of the trusts bitcoins at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders regulatory changes or interpretations could cause the trust and the sponsor to register and comply with new regulations resulting in potentially extraordinary nonrecurring expenses to the trust current and future legislation cftc and sec rulemaking and other regulatory developments may impact the manner in which bitcoins are treated for classification and clearing purposes in particular bitcoins may be classified by the cftc as commodity interests under the cea or may be classified by the sec as securities under us federal securities laws as of the date of this prospectus the sponsor is not aware of any rules that have been proposed to regulate bitcoins as a commodity interest or a security although several us federal district courts have recently held for certain purposes that bitcoins are currency or a form of money these rulings are not definitive and the sponsor and the trust cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law in the face of such developments the required registrations and compliance steps may result in extraordinary nonrecurring expenses to the trust if the sponsor decides to terminate the trust in response to the changed regulatory circumstances the trust may be dissolved or liquidated at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders to the extent that bitcoins are deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity interest under the cea the trust and the sponsor may be subject to additional regulation under the cea and cftc regulations the sponsor may be required to register as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor with the cftc and become a member of the national futures association and may be subject to additional regulatory requirements with respect to the trust including disclosure and reporting requirements these additional requirements may result in extraordinary recurring andor nonrecurring expenses of the trust thereby materially and adversely impacting the shares if the sponsor determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements the sponsor will terminate the trust any such termination could result in the liquidation of the trusts bitcoins at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders to the extent that bitcoins are deemed to fall within the definition of a security under us federal securities laws the trust and the sponsor may be subject to additional requirements under the investment company act and investment advisers act the sponsor may be required to register as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act such additional registration may result in extraordinary recurring andor nonrecurring expenses of the trust thereby materially and adversely impacting the shares if the sponsor determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements the sponsor will terminate the trust any such termination could result in the liquidation of the trusts bitcoins at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders the treatment of the trust for us federal income tax purposes is uncertain the sponsor intends to take the position that the trust will be treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes assuming that the trust is a grantor trust the trust will not be subject to us federal income tax rather a pro rata portion of the trusts income gain losses and deductions will flow through to each beneficial owner of shares    table of contents recent amendments to the trust agreement were intended to clarify the trusts classification as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes to eliminate any ambiguity that the trust since its formation has been intended to be treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes the trust petitioned for and was granted on february   an order of the court of chancery of the state of delaware reforming the trust agreement retroactively to september   the date of the original trust agreement to conform to the amendments described in the preceding sentence however the us internal revenue service the irs or a court might not agree that the trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes the trust is seeking a ruling from the irs that the trust is a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes but there can be no assurance that the trust will be successful in obtaining such a ruling if the irs were successful in asserting that the trust is not properly classified as a grantor trust the trust might be classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes although due to the uncertain treatment of bitcoins for us federal income tax purposes as discussed below in us federal income tax consequencesuncertainty regarding the us federal income tax treatment of bitcoins there can be no assurance in this regard if the trust were classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes the tax consequences of owning shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein although there might be certain differences including with respect to the timing of recognition of gain or loss in addition tax information reports provided to shareholders would be made in a different form if the trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for us federal income tax purposes it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes in that event the trust would be subject to entitylevel us federal income tax currently at a maximum marginal rate of  on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the trust to shareholders would be taxable as dividends to the extent of the trusts current and accumulated earnings and profits which in the case of a nonus shareholder generally would be subject to us federal withholding tax at a  rate or a lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty the treatment of bitcoins for us federal income tax purposes is uncertain as discussed in the section entitled us federal income tax consequencesuncertainty regarding the us federal income tax treatment of bitcoins below the trust intends to take the position that each beneficial owner of shares generally will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as the owner of an undivided interest in the bitcoins held in the trust many significant aspects of the us federal income tax treatment of bitcoins are uncertain and the sponsor does not intend to request a ruling from the irs on these issues on march   the irs released a notice the notice which discusses certain aspects of the treatment of virtual currencies such as bitcoins for us federal income tax purposes in the notice the irs stated that for us federal income tax purposes i bitcoins are property that is not currency and ii bitcoins may be held as capital assets there can be no assurance however that the irs will not alter its position with respect to bitcoins in the future or that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in the notice in addition legislation has been introduced that would if enacted cause bitcoins to be treated as currency for us federal income tax purposes if bitcoins were properly treated as currency for us federal income tax purposes gains recognized on the disposition of bitcoins would constitute ordinary income and losses recognized on the disposition of bitcoins could be subject to special reporting requirements applicable to reportable transactions the notice does not address other significant aspects of the us federal income tax treatment of bitcoins including i whether bitcoins are properly treated as commodities for us federal income tax purposes ii whether bitcoins are properly treated as collectibles for us federal income tax purposes iii the proper method of determining a holders holding period and tax basis for bitcoins acquired at different times or at varying prices and iv whether and how a holder of bitcoins acquired at different times or at varying prices may designate for us federal income tax purposes which of the bitcoins is transferred in a subsequent sale exchange or other disposition prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the substantial uncertainty regarding the tax consequences of an investment in bitcoins    table of contents future developments in the tax treatment of bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in the shares the new york state department of taxation and finance nydtf has issued guidance regarding the application of new york state tax law to virtual currencies such as bitcoins the nydtf determined that new york state would follow the notice with respect to the treatment of virtual currencies such as bitcoins for state income tax purposes furthermore the nydtf took the position that virtual currencies such as bitcoin are a form of intangible property with the result that the purchase and sale of bitcoins for fiat currency is not subject to new york state sales tax although exchanges of bitcoin for other goods and services may be subject to sales tax under barter transaction treatment the new jersey division of taxation has issued similar guidance while the taxing authorities of various states other than new york and new jersey have issued guidance exempting the acquisition andor disposition of bitcoins from sales tax it is unclear what further guidance on the treatment of bitcoins for state tax purposes may be issued in the future if a state does not follow the notice such states treatment of bitcoins may have negative consequences including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in bitcoin or the imposition of a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition of bitcoins generally any such treatment may have a negative effect on prices of bitcoins in the bitcoin exchange market and may adversely affect the value of the shares the treatment of virtual currencies such as bitcoins for tax purposes by nonus jurisdictions may differ from the treatment of virtual currencies by the irs or the nydtf if a foreign jurisdiction with a significant share of the market of bitcoin users imposes onerous tax burdens on bitcoin users or imposes sales or valueadded tax on purchases and sales of bitcoins for fiat currency such actions could result in decreased demand for bitcoins in such jurisdiction which could adversely affect the price of bitcoins and the value of the shares risk factors related to potential conflicts of interest potential conflicts of interest may arise among the sponsor or its affiliates and the trust the sponsor and its affiliates have no fiduciary duties to the trust and its shareholders which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of the trust and its shareholders the sponsor will manage the business and affairs of the trust conflicts of interest may arise among the sponsor and its affiliates including the index provider the authorized participants and genesis who serves as a liquidity provider on the one hand and the trust and its shareholders on the other hand as a result of these conflicts the sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the trust and its shareholders these potential conflicts include among others the following        the sponsor has no fiduciary duties to and is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than the trust and its shareholders in resolving conflicts of interest        the trust has agreed to indemnify the sponsor and its affiliates pursuant to the trust agreement        the sponsor is responsible for allocating its own limited resources among different clients and potential future business ventures to each of which it owes fiduciary duties        the sponsors staff also services affiliates of the sponsor and their respective clients and cannot devote all of its or their respective time or resources to the management of the business and affairs of the trust        the sponsor its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities including those that might be in direct competition with the trust        there is an absence of armslength negotiation with respect to certain terms of the trust and where applicable there has been no independent due diligence conducted with respect to this offering        barry e silbert the chief executive officer of the sponsor acts as an advisor to the index provider and owns less than

the trust will terminate and liquidate the bitcoins held by the trust appointment of a substitute sponsor will not guarantee the trusts continued operation successful or otherwise because a substitute sponsor may have no experience managing a digital currency financial vehicle a substitute sponsor may not have the experience knowledge or expertise required to ensure that the trust will

by the sponsor which could trigger early termination of the trust the custodian is not a trustee for and owes no fiduciary duties to the trust or the shareholders in addition the custodian has no duty to continue to act as the custodian of the trust the custodian can terminate    table of contents its role as custodian for any reason whatsoever upon the notice period provided under the custodian agreement the custodian may also be terminated if the custodian resigns or is removed without replacement the trust will dissolve in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement the custodians ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends poses a challenge to the safekeeping of the trusts bitcoins the history of the bitcoin exchange market has shown that bitcoin exchanges and large holders of bitcoins must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard client accounts while the custodian is required in its agreement to safeguard the custodial coins from theft loss destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack its ability to do so is based upon known technology and threats as technological change occurs the security threats to the custodial coins will likely adapt and previously unknown threats may emerge furthermore the sponsor believes that the trust may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of the trusts assets grows to the extent that the custodian is unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats the custodial coins may be subject to theft loss destruction or other attack which could have a negative impact on the performance of the shares or result in loss of the trusts assets shareholders may be adversely affected by the lack of independent advisers representing investors in the trust the sponsor has consulted with counsel accountants and other advisers regarding the formation and operation of the trust no counsel has been appointed to represent an investor in connection with the offering of the shares accordingly an investor should consult his her or its own legal tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of an investment in the shares lack of such consultation may lead to an undesirable investment decision with respect to investment in the shares shareholders may be adversely affected by lack of regular shareholder meetings and no voting rights under the trust agreement shareholders have limited voting rights and the trust will not have regular shareholder meetings and take no part in the management or control of the trust accordingly shareholders do not have the right to authorize actions appoint service providers or take other actions as may be taken by shareholders of other trusts or companies where shares carry such rights shareholders may however remove and replace the sponsor by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares the shareholders limited voting rights however give almost all control under the trust agreement to the sponsor and the trustee the sponsor may take actions in the operation of the trust that may be adverse to the interests of shareholders the sponsors operation of the trust could adversely affect an investment in the shares    table of contents use of proceeds proceeds received by the trust from the issuance and sale of

of the bitcoin industry and market introduction to bitcoins and the bitcoin network a bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is issued by and transmitted through an open source digital protocol platform using cryptographic security that is known as the bitcoin network the bitcoin network is an online peertopeer user network that hosts the public transaction ledger known as the blockchain and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and digital protocols governing the bitcoin network no single entity owns or operates the bitcoin network the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base bitcoins can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies such as the us dollar at rates determined on bitcoin exchanges or in individual endusertoenduser transactions under a barter system see uses of bitcoinsbitcoin exchange market below bitcoins are stored or reflected on the digital transaction ledger known as the blockchain which is a digital file stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each bitcoin network user the blockchain records the transaction history of all bitcoins in existence and through the transparent reporting of transactions allows the bitcoin network to verify the association of each bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns them the bitcoin network and bitcoin software programs can interpret the blockchain to determine the exact bitcoin balance if any of any digital wallet listed in the blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the bitcoin network the blockchain is comprised of a digital file downloaded and stored in whole or in part on all bitcoin users software programs the file includes all blocks that have been solved by miners and is updated to include new blocks as they are solved see bitcoin mining and creation of new bitcoins below as each newly solved block refers back to and connects with the immediately prior solved block the addition of a new block adds to the blockchain in a manner similar to a new link being added to a chain because each new block records outstanding bitcoin transactions and outstanding transactions are settled and validated through such recording the blockchain represents a complete transparent and unbroken history of all transactions on the bitcoin network each bitcoin transaction is broadcast to the bitcoin network and recorded in the blockchain offblockchain transactions involve the transfer of control over or ownership of a specific digital wallet holding bitcoins or of the reallocation of ownership of certain bitcoins in a pooledownership digital wallet such as a digital wallet owned by a bitcoin exchange information and data regarding offblockchain transactions is generally not publicly available in contrast to true bitcoin transactions which are publicly recorded on the blockchain offblockchain transactions are not truly bitcoin transactions in that they do not involve the transfer of transaction data on the bitcoin network and do not reflect a movement of bitcoins between addresses recorded in the blockchain offblockchain transactions are subject to risks as any such transfer of bitcoin ownership is not protected by the protocol behind the bitcoin network or recorded in and validated through the blockchain mechanism the bitcoin network is decentralized and does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create transmit or determine the value of bitcoins rather bitcoins are created and allocated by the bitcoin network protocol through a mining process subject to a strict wellknown issuance schedule the value of bitcoins is determined by the supply of and demand for bitcoins in the bitcoin exchange market and in private endusertoenduser transactions as well as the number of merchants that accept them as bitcoin transactions can be broadcast to the bitcoin network by any users bitcoin software and bitcoins can be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries or third parties there are little or no transaction costs in direct peertopeer transactions on the bitcoin network thirdparty service providers such as bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin thirdparty payment processing services may charge significant fees for processing transactions and for converting or facilitating the conversion of bitcoins to or from fiat currency    table of contents the bitcoin network was initially contemplated in a white paper that also described bitcoin and the operating software to govern the bitcoin network the white paper was purportedly authored by satoshi nakamoto however no individual with that name has been reliably identified as bitcoins creator and the general consensus is that the name is a pseudonym for the actual inventor or inventors the first bitcoins were created in  after nakamoto released the bitcoin network source code the software and protocol that created and launched the bitcoin network since its introduction the bitcoin network has been under active development by a group of engineers known as core developers as an open source project bitcoin is not represented by an official organization or authority although groups including mits media lab work to organize the bitcoin community and to develop and protect the bitcoin networks code overview of the bitcoin networks operations in order to own transfer or use bitcoins a person generally must have internet access to connect to the bitcoin network bitcoin transactions between parties occur rapidly typically between a few seconds and a few minutes and may be made directly between endusers without the need for a thirdparty intermediary although there are entities that provide thirdparty intermediary services to prevent the possibility of doublespending a single bitcoin each transaction is recorded time stamped and publicly displayed in a block in the publicly available blockchain thus the bitcoin network provides confirmation against doublespending by memorializing every transaction in the blockchain which is publicly accessible and downloaded in part or in whole by all users bitcoin network software programs as described below this memorialization and verification against doublespending is accomplished through the bitcoin mining process which adds blocks of data including recent transaction information to the blockchain brief description of bitcoin transfers prior to engaging in bitcoin transactions a user must first obtain a digital bitcoin wallet analogous to a bitcoin account in which to store bitcoins a wallet can be obtained among other ways through an opensource software program that generates bitcoin addresses and enables users to engage in the transfer of bitcoins with other users a user may install a bitcoin software program on its computer or mobile device that will generate a bitcoin wallet or alternatively a user may retain a third party to create a digital wallet to be used for the same purpose there is no limit on the number of digital wallets a user can have and each such wallet includes one or more unique addresses and a verification system for each address consisting of a public key and a private key which are mathematically related in a typical bitcoin transaction the bitcoin recipient creates a new bitcoin address and directs the payor to send the payment to the address by providing the address or public key for the digital wallet to the payor who will initiate the transfer this activity is analogous to a recipient providing an address in wire instructions to the payor so that cash may be wired to the recipients account the payor approves the transfer to the address provided by the recipient by signing the transaction request from the recipient with the private key of the address from where the payor is transferring the bitcoins the recipient does not make public its related private key or provide it to the payor because the private key authorizes access to and transfer of the funds from the recipients digital wallet to other users the process of signing the transaction is typically automated by the software that runs the payor and recipients digital wallet the transfer is made from the payor to the recipients wallet and this transaction is validated by the bitcoin network information and data regarding offblockchain transactions is generally not publicly available in contrast to true bitcoin transactions which are publicly recorded on the blockchain offblockchain transactions are not truly bitcoin transactions in that they do not involve the transfer of transaction data on the bitcoin network and do not reflect a movement of bitcoins between addresses recorded in the blockchain offblockchain transactions are subject to risks as any such transfer of bitcoin ownership is not protected by the protocol behind the bitcoin network or recorded in and validated through the blockchain mechanism    table of contents summary of a bitcoin transaction in a bitcoin transaction between two parties the following circumstances must be in place i the party seeking to send bitcoins must have a digital wallet and the bitcoin network must recognize that digital wallet as having sufficient bitcoins for the spending transaction ii the receiving party must have a digital wallet and iii the spending party must have internet access with which to send its spending transaction next the receiving party must provide the spending party with its wallets digital address an identifying series of  to  alphanumeric characters that represents the wallets routing number on the bitcoin network and allows the blockchain to record the sending of bitcoins to that wallet the receiving party can provide this address to the spending party in alphanumeric format or an encoded format such as a quick response code commonly known as a qr code which may be scanned by a smartphone or other device to quickly transmit the information after the provision of the receiving wallets digital address the spending party must enter the address into its bitcoin software program along with the number of bitcoins to be sent the number of bitcoins to be sent will typically be agreed upon between the two parties based on a set number of bitcoins or an agreed upon conversion of the value of fiat currency to bitcoins most bitcoin software programs also allow and often suggest the payment of a transaction fee also known as a miners fee transaction fees are not required to be included by many bitcoin software programs but when they are included they are paid by the spending party on top of the specified amount of bitcoins being sent in the transaction transaction fees if any are typically a fractional number of bitcoins for example  or  bitcoins and are automatically transferred by the bitcoin network to the bitcoin miner that solves and adds the block recording the spending transaction on the blockchain after the entry of the wallets digital address the number of bitcoins to be sent and the transaction fees if any to be paid the spending party will transmit the spending transaction the transmission of the spending transaction results in the creation of a data packet by the spending partys bitcoin software program the data packet includes data showing i the destination digital wallets address ii the number of bitcoins being sent iii the transaction fees if any and iv the spending partys digital signature verifying the authenticity of the transaction the data packet also includes references called inputs and outputs which are used by the blockchain to identify the source of the bitcoins being spent and record the flow of bitcoins from one transaction to the next transaction in which the bitcoins are spent the digital signature exposes the spending partys digital wallet address and public key to the bitcoin network though for the receiving party only its digital wallet address is revealed the spending partys bitcoin software will transmit the data packet onto the decentralized bitcoin network resulting in the propagation of the information among the software programs of bitcoin users across the bitcoin network for eventual inclusion in the blockchain typically the data will spread to a vast majority of bitcoin miners within the course of less than one minute as discussed in greater detail below in bitcoin mining and creation of new bitcoins bitcoin miners record transactions when they solve for and add blocks of information to the blockchain when a miner solves for a block it creates that block which includes data relating to i the solution to the block ii a reference to the prior block in the blockchain to which the new block is being added and iii all transactions that have occurred but have not yet been added to the blockchain the miner becomes aware of outstanding unrecorded transactions through the data packet transmission and propagation discussed above typically bitcoin transactions will be recorded in the next chronological block if the spending party has an internet connection and at least one minute has passed between the transactions data packet transmission and the solution of the next block if a transaction is not recorded in the next chronological block it is usually recorded in the next block thereafter bitcoin transactions that are micropayments typically less than  bitcoins and that do not include transaction fees to miners are currently deprioritized for recording meaning that depending on bitcoin miner    table of contents policies these transactions may take longer to record than typical transactions if the transactions do not include a transaction fee additionally transactions initiated by spending wallets with poor connections to the bitcoin network ie few or poor quality connections to nodes or supernodes that relay transaction data may be delayed in the propagation of their transaction data and therefore transaction recording on the blockchain finally to the extent that a miner chooses to limit the transactions it includes in a solved block whether by the payment of transaction fees or otherwise a transaction not meeting that miners criteria will not be included to the extent that a transaction has not yet been recorded there is a greater chance that the spending wallet can doublespend the bitcoins sent in the original transaction if the next block solved is by an honest miner not involved in the attempt to doublespend bitcoin and if the transaction data for both the original and doublespend transactions have been propagated onto the bitcoin network the transaction that is received with the earlier time stamp will be recorded by the solving miner regardless of whether the doublespending transaction includes a larger transaction fee if the doublespend transaction propagates to the solving miner and the original transaction has not then the doublespending has a greater chance of success as a result of the high difficulty in successfully initiating a doublespend without the assistance of a coordinated attack the probability of success for a doublespend transaction attempt is limited see doublespending and the bitcoin network confirmation system and forms of attack against the bitcoin network below upon the addition of a block included in the blockchain the bitcoin software program of both the spending party and the receiving party will show confirmation of the transaction on the blockchain and reflect an adjustment to the bitcoin balance in each partys digital wallet completing the bitcoin transaction typically bitcoin software programs will automatically check for and display additional confirmations of six or more blocks in the blockchain see doublespending and the bitcoin network confirmation system below cryptographic security used in the bitcoin network public and private keys all transactions on the bitcoin network are secured using publickey cryptography a technique which underpins many online transactions publickey cryptography works by generating two mathematically related keys one a public key and the other a private key one of these the private key is retained in the individuals wallet and the other key is made public and serves as the address to which a bitcoin can be transferred and from which money can be transferred by the owner of the bitcoin wallet in the case of bitcoin transactions the public key is an address a string of letters and numbers that is used to encode payments which can then only be retrieved with its associated private key which is used to authorize the transaction in other words the payor uses his private key to approve any transfers to a recipients account users on the bitcoin network can confirm that the user signed the transaction with the appropriate private key but cannot reverse engineer the private key from the signature doublespending and the bitcoin network confirmation system to ensure the integrity of bitcoin transactions from the recipients side ie to prevent doublespending by a payor every bitcoin transaction is broadcast to the bitcoin network and recorded in the blockchain through the mining process defined below which timestamps the transaction and memorializes the change in the ownership of the bitcoins transferred adding a block to the blockchain requires bitcoin miners defined below to exert significant computational effort to verify it is a valid transaction requiring this computational effort or proof of work prevents a malicious actor from either adding fraudulent blocks to generate bitcoins ie counterfeit bitcoins or overwriting existing valid blocks to reverse its prior transactions a transaction in bitcoins between two parties is recorded in the blockchain in a block only if that block is accepted as valid by a majority of the nodes on the bitcoin network validation of a block is achieved by confirming the cryptographic hash value included in the blocks solution and by the blocks addition to the    table of contents longest confirmed blockchain on the bitcoin network for a transaction inclusion in a block on the blockchain constitutes a confirmation of the bitcoin transaction as each block contains a reference to the immediately preceding block additional blocks appended to and incorporated into the blockchain constitute additional confirmations of the transactions in such prior blocks and a transaction included in a block for the first time is confirmed once against doublespending the layered confirmation process makes changing historical blocks and reversing transactions exponentially more difficult the further back one goes in the blockchain bitcoin exchanges and users can set their own threshold as to how many confirmations are required until funds from the transferor are considered valid however statistically speaking a transaction is virtually final after six confirmations as it would be extremely difficult to challenge the validity of the transaction at that point at this point in the evolution of the bitcoin network bitcoin transactions are considered irreversible once a transaction appears in the blockchain no one has the authority to reverse it if someone were to attempt to undo a past transaction in a block recorded on the blockchain such individual would have to exert tremendous processing power in a series of complicated transactions that may not be achieved at this point in the bitcoin networks development bitcoin mining and creation of new bitcoins mining process the process by which bitcoins are created and bitcoin transactions are verified is called mining to begin mining a user or miner can download and run a mining client which like regular bitcoin network software programs turns the users computer into a node on the bitcoin network that validates blocks bitcoin transactions are recorded in new blocks that are added to the blockchain and new bitcoins being issued to the miners miners through the use of the bitcoin software program engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the blockchain and thereby confirm bitcoin transactions included in that blocks data most bitcoin transactions are recorded in blocks added to the blockchain each block contains the details of some or all of the most recent transactions that are not memorialized in prior blocks as well as a record of the award of bitcoins to the miner who added the new block in order to add blocks to the blockchain a miner must map an input data set ie the blockchain plus a block of the most recent bitcoin network transactions and an arbitrary number called a nonce to a desired output data set of a predetermined length the hash value using the sha cryptographic hash algorithm each unique block can only be solved and added to the blockchain by one miner therefore all individual miners and mining pools on the bitcoin network are engaged in a competitive process of constantly increasing their computing power to improve their likelihood of solving for new blocks as more miners join the bitcoin network and its processing power increases the bitcoin network adjusts the complexity of the blocksolving equation to maintain a predetermined pace of adding a new block to the blockchain approximately every ten minutes a miners proposed block is added to the blockchain once a majority of the nodes on the bitcoin network confirms the miners work miners that are successful in adding a block to the blockchain are automatically awarded bitcoins for their effort plus any transaction fees paid by transferors whose transactions are recorded in the block this reward system is the method by which new bitcoins enter into circulation to the public incentives for mining as noted above miners that are successful in adding a block to the blockchain are automatically awarded bitcoins for their effort given the increasing difficulty of the target established by the bitcoin network current miners are required to invest in expensive mining devices with adequate processing power to hash at a competitive rate the first wave of mining devices used central processing units cpus used in standard home computers miners soon discovered that graphic processing units gpus provided them with more processing    table of contents power and the second wave of miners entered the bitcoin network today the bitcoin network is well into a third wave of mining devices which consist of mining computers that are designed solely for mining purposes such devices include asic applicationspecific integrated circuit machines built specifically for bitcoin mining by specialized companies like bitman technologies these new computers are significantly more expensive than standard home computers miners also incur substantial electricity costs in order to continuously power and cool their devices while solving for a new block the bitcoin network is designed in such a way that the reward for adding new blocks to the blockchain decreases over time and the production and reward of bitcoins will eventually cease once such incentive mechanism ceases to be profitable miners will only have transaction fees to incentivize them and as a result it is expected that miners will need to be better compensated with higher transaction fees to ensure that there is adequate incentive for them to continue mining mining pools the significant increase in the number of miners and the increasing in mining capacity have radically increased the difficulty of finding a valid hash since the first block was mined in some respects hashing is akin to a mathematical lottery and miners that have devices with greater processing power ie the ability to make more hash calculations per second are more likely to be successful miners currently the likelihood that an individual acting alone will be able to be awarded a bitcoin is extremely low as a result mining pools have developed in which multiple miners act cohesively and combine their processing power to solve blocks when a pool solves a new block the pool operator receives the bitcoin and after taking a nominal fee splits the resulting reward among the pool participants based on the processing power they each contributed to solve for such block mining pools provide participants with access to smaller but steadier and more frequent bitcoin payouts as of april   the three largest identifiable mining pools were antpool fpool and bitfury which when aggregated represented approximately  of the processing power on the bitcoin network as calculated by determining the percentage of blocks mined by each such pool over the prior four days as of april   the ten largest identifiable pools were antpool fpool bitfury btctop btcc pool bixin slushpool btccom via btc and bwcom which accounted for approximately  of the mining processing power on the bitcoin network mathematically controlled supply the supply of new bitcoins is mathematically controlled in a manner so that the number of bitcoins grows at a limited rate pursuant to a preset schedule the number of bitcoins awarded for solving a new block is automatically halved after every  blocks are added to the blockchain currently the fixed reward for solving a new block is  bitcoins per block and this is expected to decrease by half to become  bitcoins after the next  blocks have entered the bitcoin network which is expected to be july  this deliberately controlled rate of bitcoin creation means that the number of bitcoins in existence will increase at a controlled rate until the number of bitcoins in existence reaches the predetermined  million bitcoins as of april   approximately  million bitcoins have been mined and estimates of when the  million bitcoin limitation will be reached range up to the year  modifications to the bitcoin protocol bitcoin is an open source project ie a product whose source code is freely available to the public and that utilizes crowdsourcing to identify possible issues problems and defects with no official developer or group of developers that controls the bitcoin network however the bitcoin networks development is overseen by a core group of developers including those employed by mit media labs digital currency initiative the core developers the core developers are able to access and can alter the bitcoin network source code and as a result they are responsible for quasiofficial releases of updates and other changes to the bitcoin networks source code the release of updates to the bitcoin networks source code does not guarantee that the updated    table of contents will be automatically adopted users and miners must accept any changes made to the bitcoin source code by downloading the proposed modification of the bitcoin networks source code a modification of the bitcoin networks source code is only effective with respect to the bitcoin users and miners that download it if a modification is accepted only by a percentage of users and miners a division in the bitcoin network will occur such that one network will run the premodification source code and the other network will run the modified source code such a division is known as a fork in the bitcoin network see risk factorsrisk factors related to the bitcoin network and bitcoinsthe acceptance of bitcoin network software patches or upgrades by a significant but not overwhelming percentage of the users and miners in the bitcoin network could result in a fork in the blockchain resulting in the operation of two separate networks consequently as a practical matter a modification to the source code only becomes part of the bitcoin network if accepted by participants collectively having a majority of the processing power on the bitcoin network core development of the bitcoin source code has increasingly focused on modifications of the bitcoin protocol to allow nonfinancial and next generation uses sometimes referred to as bitcoin  projects these uses include smart contracts and distributed registers built into built atop or pegged alongside the blockchain for example the white paper for blockstream a company of which core developers pieter wuille and gregory maxwell are a part calls for the use of pegged sidechains to develop programming environments that are built within block chain ledgers that can interact with and rely on the security of the bitcoin network and blockchain while remaining independent thereof the trusts activities will not directly relate to bitcoin  projects though bitcoin  projects may utilize bitcoins as tokens for the facilitation of their nonfinancial uses thereby potentially increasing demand for bitcoins and the utility of the bitcoin network as a whole conversely bitcoin  projects that operate and are built within the blockchain may increase the data flow on the bitcoin network and could either bloat the size of the blockchain or slow confirmation times at this time bitcoin  projects remain in early stages and have not been materially integrated into the blockchain or bitcoin network bitcoin value bitcoins are not a fiat currency ie a currency that is backed by a central bank or a national supranational or quasinational organization and are not backed by hard assets or other credit as a result the value of bitcoins is currently determined by the value that various market participants place on bitcoins through their transactions exchange valuation due to the peertopeer framework of the bitcoin network and the protocols thereunder transferors and recipients of bitcoins are able to determine the value of the bitcoins transferred by mutual agreement or barter with respect to their transactions as a result the most common means of determining the value of a bitcoin is by surveying one or more bitcoin exchanges where bitcoins are bought sold and traded on each bitcoin exchange bitcoins are traded with publicly disclosed valuations for each transaction measured by one or more fiat currencies such as the us dollar or the chinese yuan historically a large percentage of the global bitcoin trading volume occurred on selfreported unregulated exchanges located in china in january  the largest chinabased bitcoin exchangesbtcc huobi and okcoinadjusted their terms to pause or limit loan and borrowing services in response to informal guidance received from the peoples bank of china concerning the creation of tighter antimoney laundering and foreign exchange controls on january   these exchanges introduced a  fixedrate transaction fee for all bitcoin buy and sell orders in response to added regulatory pressure by the peoples bank of china in february  chinas smaller bitcoin exchanges including btc trade btc chbtc dahonghuo yuanboa and bitbays also imposed or increased trading fees on their respective exchanges in the subsequent weeks btcc huobi and okcoin halted bitcoin withdrawals these events have substantially reduced the volume traded on chinese exchanges and changed the global liquidity profile for bitcoins    table of contents for example from may   to january   the three primary chinese bitcoin exchanges btcc huobi and okcoin reported a total trade volume of approximately  billion bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of  million bitcoins comprising more than  of the global exchangetraded volume based on data from the index provider during this period the exchanges that comprised the index including bitfinex bitstamp gdax formerly known as coinbase exchange okcoin and kraken which was only included in the index on the day of may   reported a total trade volume of  million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of approximately  bitcoins accounting for approximately  of the global exchangetraded volume and  of the us dollardenominated trade volume however from january   to april   following the introduction of fixedrate transaction fees in response to added regulatory pressure by the peoples bank of china the three primary chinese bitcoin exchanges btcc huobi and okcoin reported a total trade volume of approximately  million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of approximately  bitcoins comprising only  of the global exchangetraded volume based on data from the index provider during this period the exchanges that comprised the index including bitfinex bitstamp gdax formerly known as coinbase exchange itbit and okcoin which was removed from the index on february   reported a total trade volume of approximately  million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of nearly  bitcoins accounting for  of the global exchangetraded volume and  of the us dollardenominated trade volume similar to other currency pairs such as euro to bitcoin movements in pricing on the chinese exchanges are generally inline with us dollardenominated exchanges for example based on data from the index provider from may   to april   the  pm new york time spot price on the three primary chinese yuandenominated exchanges btcc huobi and okcoin differed from the bitcoin index price by only  on average the index and the bitcoin index price the trust values its bitcoins for operational purposes by reference to the bitcoin index price the bitcoin index price is the value of a bitcoin as represented by the index calculated at  pm new york time on each business day the index provider develops calculates and publishes the index on a continuous basis using the volumeweighted price at trading venues as selected by the index provider if the index becomes unavailable or if the sponsor determines in good faith that the index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price then the sponsor will on a best efforts basis contact the index provider in order to obtain the bitcoin index price if after such contact the index remains unavailable or the sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price then the administrator will use the following cascading set of rules to calculate the bitcoin index price for the avoidance of doubt the sponsor will employ the below rules sequentially and in the order presented below should one or more specific rules fail      bitcoin index price  the price set by the index as of  pm new york time on the valuation date the index is a us dollardenominated composite reference rate for the price of bitcoin based on the volumeweighted price at trading venues selected by the index provider trading venues used to calculate the index may include bitcoin exchanges overthecounter markets or derivative platforms to ensure that the index providers trading venue selection process is impartial the index provider considers depth of liquidity compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements data availability us domicile and acceptance of us dollar deposits the index provider conducts a quarterly review of these criteria in the calculation of the bitcoin index price the index provider cleanses the trade data and compiles it in such a manner as to algorithmically reduce the impact of anomalistic or manipulative trading this is accomplished by adjusting the weight of each input based on price deviation relative to the observable set of data for the relevant trading venue as well as recent and longterm trading volume at each venue relative to the observable set for the relevant trading venues the index provider reduces the weighting    table of contents of data inputs as they get further from the mean price across the trading venues and ultimately excludes any trade with a price that deviates beyond a certain predetermined threshold level from the mean in addition the index groups trade bursts or movements during offpeak trading hours on any given venue into single data inputs which reduces the potentially erratic price movements caused by small individual orders the index provider formally reevaluates the weighting algorithm quarterly but maintains discretion to change the way in which the index is calculated based on its periodic review or in extreme circumstances the index provider does not currently include data from overthecounter markets or derivative platforms overthecounter data is not currently included because of the potential for trades to include a significant premium or discount paid for larger liquidity which creates an uneven comparison relative to more active markets there is also a higher potential for overthecounter transactions to not be armslength and thus not be representative of a true market price bitcoin derivative markets are also not currently included as the markets remain relatively thin the index provider will consider international organization of securities commissions principles for financial benchmarks and the management of trading venues of bitcoin derivatives when considering inclusion of overthecounter or derivativeplatform data in the future the bitcoin index price is calculated by applying the weighting algorithm to the price and volume of all inputs for the immediately preceding hour period as of  pm new york time on the valuation date to measure volume data and trading halts the index provider monitors trading activity and regards as eligible those bitcoin exchanges that it determines represent a substantial portion of us dollardenominated trading over a sustained period on a platform without a significant history of trading disruptions the index provider maintains a monitoring system that tests for these criteria on an ongoing basis the description of the index is based on information publicly available at the index providers website at httpstradeblockcommarketsindex none of the information on the index providers websites is incorporated by reference into this prospectus if the index becomes unavailable or if the sponsor determines in good faith that the index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin value then the sponsor will on a best efforts basis contact the index provider to obtain the bitcoin index price directly from the index provider if after such contact

a bitcoin benchmark exchange is a bitcoin exchange that represents at least  of the aggregate us dollardenominated trading volume of the bitcoin market during the last  consecutive calendar days and that to the knowledge of the sponsor is in substantial compliance with the laws rules and regulations including any antimoney laundering and knowyourcustomer procedures of such bitcoin exchanges applicable jurisdiction provided that if there are fewer than three such bitcoin exchanges then the bitcoin benchmark exchanges will include such bitcoin exchange or bitcoin exchanges that meet the abovedescribed requirements as well as one or more additional bitcoin exchanges selected by the sponsor that have had monthly trading volume of at least  bitcoins during the last  consecutive calendar days and that to the knowledge of the sponsor is in substantial compliance with the laws rules and regulations including any antimoney laundering and knowyourcustomer procedures of such bitcoin

administrator the trust the shareholders or anyone else in connection with such changes the index provider is not required to publicize or explain the changes or to alert the sponsor or the administrator to such changes forms of attack against the bitcoin network exploitation of flaws in the bitcoin networks source code as with any other computer code flaws in the bitcoin network source code have been exposed by certain malicious actors several errors and defects have been found and corrected including those that disabled some functionality for users exposed users information or allowed users to create multiple views of the bitcoin network discovery of flaws in or exploitations of the source code that allow malicious actors to take or create money in contravention of known bitcoin network rules have been relatively rare for example in  a hacker or group of hackers exploited a flaw in the bitcoin network source code that allowed them to generate  billion bitcoins in a transaction and send them to two digital wallet addresses however the bitcoin community and developers identified and reversed the manipulated transactions within approximately three hours and the flaw was corrected with an updated version of the bitcoin protocol the core developers in conjunction with other developers and miners work continuously in an attempt to ensure that flaws are quickly fixed or removed because open source codes rely on transparency to promote communitysourced identification and solution of problems within the code such flaws have been discovered and quickly corrected by the core developers or the bitcoin community greater than  of network computational power a malicious actor can structure an attack after such actor gains control of more than half of the bitcoin networks processing power or hashrate during may and june  mining pool ghashios hashing power approached  of the processing power on the bitcoin network during a brief period in early june the mining pool may have controlled in excess of onehalf of the bitcoin networks processing power although no malicious activity or abnormal transaction recording was observed the incident establishes that it is possible that a substantial mining pool may accumulate close to or more than a majority of the processing power on the bitcoin network if a malicious actor acquired sufficient computational power necessary to control the bitcoin network among other things it would be able to reverse transactions and possibly engage in doublespending or prevent some or all transactions from being confirmed and prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid new blocks a number of computer scientists and cryptographers believe that the immense collective processing power of the bitcoin network makes it impracticable for an actor to gain control of computers representing a majority of the processing power on the bitcoin network cancer nodes cancer nodes are fake bitcoin nodes which a malicious actor sets up to either place connecting users on a separate network or disconnect them from all networks this form of attack involves a malicious actor propagating cancer nodes to isolate certain users from the legitimate bitcoin network a target user who is surrounded by such cancer nodes would be placed on a separate network allowing the malicious actor to relay only blocks created by the separate network and thus opening the target user to doublespending attacks by using cancer nodes a malicious actor can also disconnect the target user from the bitcoin economy entirely by refusing to relay any blocks or transactions bitcoin software programs make these attacks more difficult by limiting the number of outbound connections through which users are connected to the bitcoin network    table of contents doublespending risks a malicious actor may attempt to double spend bitcoins by manipulating the formation of the blockchain rather than through control of the bitcoin network variations of this form of attack include the finney attack race attack and vector attack in this type of attack a miner creates a valid new block containing a doublespend transaction and schedules the release of such attack block so that it is added to the blockchain before a target users legitimate transaction can be included in a block all doublespend attacks require that the miner sequence and execute the steps of its attack with sufficient speed and accuracy typically transactions that allow for a zeroconfirmation acceptance tend to be prone to these types of attacks users and merchants can reduce the risk of a doublespend attack by waiting for multiple confirmations from the bitcoin network before settling a transaction these attacks require extensive coordination and are very expensive accordingly traders and merchants may still execute instantaneous lowvalue transactions without confirmation because it is generally agreed that a malicious miner would be unwilling to carry out a doublespend attack for lowvalue transactions users and merchants can take additional precautions by adjusting their bitcoin network software programs to connect only to other wellconnected nodes and to disable incoming connections these precautions reduce the risk of doublespend attacks involving manipulation of a targets connectivity to the bitcoin network as is the case with vector and race attacks market participants miners miners range from bitcoin enthusiasts to professional mining operations that design and build dedicated machines and data centers but the vast majority of mining is now undertaken by mining pools see bitcoin mining and creation of new bitcoins above investment and speculative sector this sector includes the

policy that currently suspends withdrawals from its exchange historically a large percentage of the global bitcoin trading volume occurred on selfreported unregulated exchanges located in china in january  the largest chinabased bitcoin exchangesbtcc huobi and okcoinadjusted their terms to pause or limit loan and borrowing services in response to informal guidance received from the peoples bank of china concerning the creation of tighter antimoney laundering and foreign exchange controls on january   these exchanges introduced a  fixedrate transaction fee for all bitcoin buy and sell

increased trading fees on their respective exchanges in the subsequent weeks btcc huobi and okcoin halted    table of contents bitcoin withdrawals these events have substantially reduced the volume traded on chinese exchanges and changed the global liquidity profile for bitcoins for example from may   to january   the three primary chinese bitcoin exchanges btcc huobi and okcoin reported a total trade volume of approximately  billion bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of  million bitcoins comprising more than  of the global exchangetraded volume based on data from the index provider during this period the exchanges that comprised the indexbitfinex bitstamp gdax formerly known as coinbase exchange okcoin and kraken which was only included in the index on the day of may  reported a total trade volume of  million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of approximately  bitcoins accounting for approximately  of the global exchangetraded volume and  of the us dollardenominated trade volume however from january   to april   following the introduction of fixedrate transaction fees in response to added regulatory pressure by the peoples bank of china the three primary chinese bitcoin exchangesbtcc huobi and okcoinreported a total trade volume of approximately  million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of approximately  bitcoins comprising only  of the global exchangetraded volume based on data from the index provider during this period the exchanges that comprised the indexbitfinex bitstamp gdax formerly known as coinbase exchange itbit and okcoin which was removed from the index on february  reported a total trade volume of approximately  million bitcoins and an average daily trade volume of nearly  bitcoins accounting for  of the global exchangetraded volume and  of the us dollardenominated trade volume similar to other currency pairs such as euro to bitcoin movements in pricing on the chinese exchanges are generally inline with us dollardenominated exchanges for example based on data from the index provider from may   to april   the  pm new york time spot price on the three primary chinese yuandenominated exchanges btcc huobi and okcoin differed from the bitcoin index price by only  on average in addition to open online bitcoin exchanges there are dark pools which are bitcoin trading platforms that do not publicly report bitcoin trade data market participants have the ability to execute large block trades on a dark pool without revealing those trades and the related price data to the public bitcoin exchange market although any withdrawal from or deposit to a dark pool platform may be recorded on the blockchain tradehill is an example of one such institutional dark pool although it halted operations in august  to allow for regulatory compliance upgrades genesis also operates a form of dark pool through a trading desk that buys and sells large blocks of bitcoins without publically reporting trade data informal dark pools are currently believed to exist particularly among wholesale buyers of bitcoin and bitcoin mining groups that obtain large supplies of bitcoin through mining such informal dark pools function as a result of the peertopeer nature of the bitcoin network which allows direct transactions between any seller and buyer as the bitcoin exchange market and bitcoin dark pools have a limited history it is difficult to estimate the impact of dark pools on the bitcoin exchange market goods and services bitcoins increasingly can be used to purchase goods and services either online or at physical locations while reliable data is not readily available on the retail and commercial market penetration of the bitcoin network there are numerous indications of its increasing acceptance for example the bitcoin payment processors bitpay and coinbase publicly represent that over  businesses and organizations are now using those processors services to accept bitcoin payments additionally paypal announced that it would allow merchants that use its payment processing services to accept bitcoin a wide range of industries now accept bitcoins as a form of payment from newspapers to national sports franchises such as the sacramento kings additionally forprofit internetbased companies such as microsoft wordpress reddit zynga expedia dell tigerdirectcom and overstockcom as well as nonprofit institutions such as khan academy and charitable organizations such as the red cross have received attention for accepting donations in bitcoins endusertoenduser the bitcoin endusertoenduser ecosystem operates on a continuous hour per day basis this is accomplished through decentralized peertopeer transactions between parties on a principaltoprincipal basis    table of contents all risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction liquidity can change from time to time during the course of a hour trading day the bitcoin network rules that require transaction fees are generally not enforced therefore transaction costs if any are negotiable between the parties and may vary widely although where transaction fees are included they are paid by the sending party in a bitcoin transaction these transactions occur remotely through the internet inperson through forums such as localbitcoinscom which offers both online and inperson opportunities to buy and sell bitcoins there are currently no official designated market makers for bitcoins and hence no standard transaction sizes bidoffer spreads or typical known cost per transaction marketplaces like localbitcoinscom are intended to create a market by bringing together counterparties trading in bitcoins but they do not provide any clearing or intermediary function anonymity bitcoins have a reputation for providing privacy to its users but the bitcoin network was not designed to ensure the anonymity of users while the blockchain records the unique addresses of individual bitcoin wallets it does not contain anything about the people using them however an analysis of the public log of all bitcoin transactions suggests that it may be easy for a law enforcement agency to identify a number of bitcoin users offblockchain transactions occurring off the bitcoin network are not recorded and do not represent the transfer of bitcoins from one digital wallet address to another though information regarding participants in an offblockchain transaction may be recorded by the parties facilitating such offblockchain transactions nevertheless users determined to maintain anonymity may take certain precautions to enhance the likelihood that they and their transactions remain anonymous for instance a user may send its bitcoins to different addresses multiple times to make tracking the bitcoins through the blockchain more difficult or more simply engage a socalled mixing service to switch its bitcoins with those of other users however some bitcoin exchanges may refuse to accept bitcoins from users who have used mixing services to the extent that a significant portion of bitcoin users begin to value these mixing services and a substantial number of bitcoin exchanges refuse to accept these bitcoins the demand for bitcoin may decrease and an investment in the shares may be adversely affected competition bitcoins are not the only type of digital currencies founded on cryptography although as of the date of this prospectus it is considered the most prominent other cryptographic digital currencies have developed since the bitcoin networks inception ethereum ethereum classic ripple litecoin dash and monero are just a few examples of bitcoin alternatives the bitcoin network however possesses the firsttomarket advantage and has captured the majority of the industrys market share government oversight as bitcoins have grown in both popularity and market size the us congress and a number of us federal and state agencies including fincen sec cftc finra the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the department of justice the department of homeland security the federal bureau of investigation the irs and state financial institution regulators have been examining the operations of bitcoins bitcoin users and the bitcoin exchange with particular focus on the extent to which bitcoins can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other serviceproviders that hold bitcoins for users many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by bitcoins to investors in addition federal and state agencies and other countries have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of bitcoin transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in bitcoin activity ongoing and future regulatory actions may alter perhaps to a materially adverse extent the nature of an investment in the shares or the ability of the trust to continue to operate additionally us state and federal and foreign regulators and legislatures have taken action against bitcoin businesses or enacted restrictive regimes in response to adverse publicity arising from hacks consumer harm or    table of contents criminal activity stemming from bitcoin activity see risk factors related to the regulation of the trust and the shares regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in the shares or restrict the use of bitcoins or the operation of the bitcoin network or the bitcoin exchange market in a manner that adversely affects an investment in the shares various foreign jurisdictions may in the near future adopt laws regulations or directives that affect the bitcoin network the bitcoin exchange market and their users particularly bitcoin exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions regulatory scope such laws regulations or directives may conflict with those of the united states and may negatively impact the acceptance of bitcoin by users merchants and service providers outside the united states and may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of the bitcoin economy in the european union china japan russia and the united states and globally or otherwise negatively affect the value of bitcoin the effect of any

satisfy either the second or third such rule when calculating the trusts bitcoin holdings in the event bitcoinchartscom was unavailable the sponsor utilized data taken from wwwcryptocoinchartsinfo during this period the sponsor primarily used the volumeweighted average bitcoin prices published on either bitcoinchartscom or cryptocoinchartsinfo for bitstamp btce mt gox and bitfinex as these were the exchanges with the highest trading volumes however not every exchange was included in each day during that period as certain exchanges experienced interruptions a number of smaller exchanges were

following table sets forth information regarding the selling shareholders beneficial ownership of the trusts shares as of           beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the sec and generally means that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power of that security except as indicated by the footnotes below we believe based on the information furnished to us that the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown that they beneficially own subject to community property laws where applicable the information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership is based on  shares outstanding as of march   the address of each selling shareholder and each person who may be deemed a beneficial owner of the shares held thereby is co                name of beneficial owner    number of shares beneficially owned before the offering      percentage beneficially owned before the offering      number of shares to be sold in the offering      percentage

attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to such securities    table of contents activities of the trust the activities of the trust will be limited to  issuing baskets in exchange for bitcoins deposited by the authorized participants or liquidity providers as applicable with the custodian as consideration  transferring actual bitcoins as necessary to cover the sponsors fee and selling bitcoins as necessary to pay additional trust expenses  transferring actual bitcoins in exchange for baskets surrendered for redemption by the authorized participants  causing the sponsor to sell bitcoins on the termination of the trust and  engaging in all administrative and custodial procedures necessary to accomplish such activities in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement the trust will not be actively managed it will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to ameliorate losses caused by changes in the market prices of bitcoins trust objective the investment objective of the trust is for the shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the index less the trusts liabilities and expenses the shares are designed to provide investors with a costeffective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin a substantial direct investment in bitcoins may require expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the acquisition security and safekeeping of the bitcoins and may involve the payment of substantial fees to acquire such bitcoins from thirdparty facilitators through cash payments of us dollars although the shares will not be the exact equivalent of a direct investment in bitcoins they provide investors with an alternative that constitutes a relatively costeffective way to participate in bitcoin markets through the securities market because the value of the shares is tied to the value of the bitcoins held by the trust it is important to understand the investment attributes of and the market for bitcoins strategy behind the shares the shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in bitcoin markets through an investment in securities on the first day the shares were offered each share in the initial basket represented  bitcoin the logistics of accepting transferring and safekeeping of bitcoins are dealt with by the sponsor administrator and custodian and the related expenses are built into the price of the shares therefore shareholders do not have additional tasks or costs in addition to those associated with investing in any other publicly traded security the shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and costeffective means with minimal credit risk of gaining investment benefits similar to those of directly holding bitcoins the shares offer an investment that is        easily accessible and relatively cost efficient  investors in the shares can also directly access bitcoin markets through the bitcoin exchange market the sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies that use bitcoins by using the shares instead of directly purchasing and holding bitcoins and for many investors transaction costs related to the shares will be lower than those associated with the direct purchase storage and safekeeping of bitcoins        exchange traded and transparent  the shares will be listed and trade on nyse arca providing investors with an efficient means to implement various investment strategies upon effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part the shares will be eligible for margin accounts and will be backed by the assets of the trust the trust will not hold or employ any derivative securities furthermore the value of the trusts assets will be reported each day on httpsgrayscalecobitcoininvestmenttrustmarketperformance        minimal credit risk  the shares represent an interest in actual bitcoins owned by the trust the trusts bitcoins in the custodians possession are not subject to borrowing arrangements with third    table of contents   parties or counterparty or credit risks this contrasts with the other financial products such as teraexchange swaps through which investors gain exposure to bitcoins through the use of derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks        safekeeping system  the custodian has been appointed to store and safekeep the bitcoins for the trust using a segregated and therefore diversified safekeeping storage system the hardware software administration and continued technological development that are used by the custodian may not be available or costeffective for many investors the trust differentiates itself from competing digital currency financial vehicles to the extent that such digital currency financial vehicles may develop in the following ways        custodian  the custodian that holds the private keys for the digital wallets of the trust is xapo inc other digital currency financial vehicles that use cold storage may not use a custodian to hold their private keys        cold storage of private keys  all of the private keys for the trusts vault account are kept in cold storage which means that the bitcoins held by the trusts vault account are not directly connected to or accessible from the internet or other computers without the private keys see custody of the trusts bitcoins for more information relating to the distribution and withdrawal of the trusts private keys to and from cold storage other digital currency financial vehicles may not utilize cold storage or may utilize less effective cold storagerelated hardware and security protocols        location of private vaults  vaults are located in geographically dispersed locations across the world including but not limited to the united states europe including switzerland and south america confidential information such as the private keys and cryptographic materials are physically stored on offline servers that never have and never will have access to the internet or any other kind of network vault locations are protected by extraordinary security measures including intense human biometric and automated systems  hours a day seven days a week vaults incorporate multiple layers of extremely advanced forms of cryptographic security to secure bitcoins these processes include multifactor authentication and private key segmentation the geographic dispersion of vaults is designed to protect assets from being lost due to the compromise of any given vault location even if the physical and cryptographic layers of security in one jurisdiction are overcome the other vault locations would remain uncompromised        enhanced security  the custodian and sponsor have put enhanced security procedures in place that require one or more employees of the sponsor to verify each transaction with each employee having a unique verification method the custodian and the sponsor have put additional similar enhanced security procedures in place to protect against the malicious movement of bitcoin        custodian audits  the custodian has agreed to allow the trust and the sponsor take any necessary steps to verify that satisfactory internal control system and procedures are in place and to visit and inspect the systems on which the custodian coins are held the custodian is also obligated to provide the trust and sponsor with both independent and audit reports on the bitcoin account        directly held bitcoins  the trust directly owns actual bitcoins held through the custodian the direct ownership of bitcoins is not subject to counterparty or credit risks this may differ from other digital currency financial vehicles that provide bitcoin exposure through other means such as the use of financial or derivative instruments        structure  the shares intend to track the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the index less the trusts liabilities and expenses the trust seeks to achieve this objective by directly owning bitcoins this structure may be different from other digital currency financial vehicles that seek to track the performance of the price of bitcoins or other digital currencies through the use of futures contracts or derivative instruments        sponsors fee  the relatively low level of the sponsors fee that is paid to the sponsor is a competitive factor that may influence an investors decision to purchase shares    table of contents secondary market trading while the trusts investment objective is for the shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the index less the trusts liabilities and expenses the shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher than the bitcoin holdings per share the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the bitcoin holdings per share may be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours and liquidity between the secondary market and larger bitcoin exchanges in the bitcoin exchange market while the shares will be listed and trade on nyse arca from  am until  pm new york time liquidity in the bitcoin exchange market may fluctuate depending upon the volume and availability of larger bitcoin exchanges as a result during periods in which bitcoin exchange market liquidity is limited or a major bitcoin exchange is offline trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen trust expenses the trusts only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the sponsors fee the sponsors fee will be determined by applying a  annual rate to the trusts bitcoin holdings as calculated and published by the sponsor or its delegates and converting the resulting us dollar amount into bitcoins at the bitcoin index price on a daily basis the rate of the sponsors fee is subject to the sole discretion of the sponsor payments of the sponsors fee will occur monthly in arrears to pay the sponsors fee the custodian will when directed by the sponsor i withdraw from the bitcoin account the number of bitcoins equal to the accrued but unpaid sponsors fee determined as described above and ii transfer such bitcoins to an account maintained by the custodian for the sponsor the sponsor from time to time may temporarily waive all or a portion of the sponsors fee in its discretion for stated periods of time presently the sponsor does not intend to waive any of the sponsors fee as consideration for its receipt of the sponsors fee the sponsor has assumed the obligation to pay the sponsorpaid expenses the sponsor has not assumed the obligation to pay additional trust expenses if additional trust expenses are incurred the sponsor will cause the custodian to convert bitcoins into us dollars or other fiat currencies at the actual exchange rate in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such additional trust expenses the number of bitcoins represented by a share will decline each time the trust pays the sponsors fee or any additional trust expenses see expenses impact of trust expenses on the trusts bitcoin holdings the trust will pay the sponsors fee to the sponsor in bitcoins in addition the trust will sell bitcoins to raise the funds needed for the payment of any additional trust expenses the purchase price received as consideration for such sales will be the trusts sole source of funds to cover its additional trust expenses the trust will not engage in any activity designed to derive a profit from changes in the prices of bitcoins because the number of bitcoins held by the trust will decrease when bitcoins are used to pay the sponsors fee or sold to permit the payment of additional trust expenses the number of bitcoins represented by each share will decrease over the life of the trust accordingly the shareholders will bear the cost of the sponsors fee and additional trust expenses new deposits of bitcoins into the bitcoin account that are received in exchange for additional new baskets issued by the trust will not reverse this trend    table of contents hypothetical expense example the following table illustrates the anticipated impact of the payment of the trusts expenses on the fractional number of bitcoins represented by each outstanding share for three years it assumes that the only transfers of bitcoins will be those needed to pay the sponsors fee and that the price of bitcoins and the number of shares remain constant during the threeyear period covered the table does not show the impact of any additional trust expenses any additional trust expenses if and when incurred will accelerate the decrease in the fractional number of bitcoins represented by each share in addition the table does not show the effect of any waivers of the sponsors fee that may be in effect from time to time       year                    hypothetical price per bitcoin

delaware statutory trust that was formed on september   by the filing of the certificate of trust with the delaware secretary of state in accordance with the provisions of the delaware statutory trust act dsta the trust operates pursuant to the trust agreement the trust holds only bitcoins and is expected from time to time to issue baskets in exchange for deposits of bitcoins and to distribute bitcoins in connection with redemptions of baskets the investment objective of the trust is for the shares to reflect the performance of the value of bitcoins as represented by the index less the trusts liabilities and expenses the sponsor believes that for many investors the shares will represent a costeffective and convenient investment relative to a direct outright investment in bitcoins the shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the trust the trust is passive and is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle the bitcoins held by the custodian on behalf of the trust will be transferred out of the bitcoin account only in the following circumstances transferred to pay the sponsors fee distributed to authorized participants or liquidity providers as applicable in connection with the redemption of baskets transferred to be sold on an asneeded basis to pay additional trust expenses sold on behalf of the trust

purposes of the cea and that neither the sponsor nor the trustee is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with the operation of the trust the trust expects to create and redeem shares from time to time but only in baskets a basket equals a block of  shares the number of outstanding shares is expected to increase and decrease from time to time as a result of the creation and redemption of baskets the creation and redemption of baskets require the delivery to the trust or the distribution by the trust of the number of bitcoins represented by the baskets being created or redeemed the creation and redemption of a basket will be made only in exchange for the delivery to the trust or the distribution by the trust of the number of whole and fractional bitcoins represented by each basket being created or redeemed the number of which is determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the trust at  pm new york time on the trade date of a creation or redemption order as adjusted for the number of whole and fractional bitcoins constituting accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the trust by the number of shares outstanding at such time the quotient so obtained calculated to one onehundredmillionth of one bitcoin and multiplying such quotient by  each share currently represents approximately  of a bitcoin each share in the initial baskets represented approximately  bitcoin the number of bitcoins required to create a basket or to be delivered upon a redemption of a basket will gradually decrease over time due to the transfer or sale of the trusts bitcoins to pay the sponsors fee and any additional trust expenses the trust will not accept or distribute cash in exchange for baskets other than upon its dissolution see plan of distribution the administrator will determine the trusts bitcoin holdings which is the aggregate us dollar value based on the bitcoin index price of the trusts bitcoins

interest general the sponsor has not established formal procedures to resolve all potential conflicts of interest consequently investors may be dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably although the sponsor attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for the sponsor to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to the trust prospective investors should be aware that the sponsor presently intends to assert that shareholders have by subscribing for shares of the trust consented to the following conflicts of interest in the event of any proceeding alleging that such conflicts violated any duty owed by the sponsor to investors digital currency group inc digital currency group inc the sole member and parent company of the sponsor is also the sole shareholder and parent company of genesis which is currently the only acting liquidity provider digital currency group inc also owns less than  of the index providers voting equity either directly or through warrants and a minority interest in the custodian that represents less than  of the custodians equity digital currency group inc owns a minority interest holder in coinbase which operates the gdax representing approximately  of its equity and a minority interest holder in paxos which operates itbit representing less than  of its equity the sponsor the sponsor has a conflict of interest in allocating its own limited resources among when applicable different clients and potential future business ventures to each of which it owes fiduciary duties additionally the professional staff of the sponsor also services other affiliates of the sponsor and their respective clients although the sponsor and its professional staff cannot and will not devote all of its or their respective time or resources to the management of the business and affairs of the trust the sponsor intends to devote and to cause its professional staff to devote sufficient time and resources to manage properly the business and affairs of the trust consistent with its or their respective fiduciary duties to the trust and others because of the sponsors affiliated status it may be disincentivized to replace affiliated service providers in connection with these conflicts of interest shareholders should understand that affiliated service providers receive fees for providing services to the trust and clients of the affiliated service providers may pay commissions at negotiated rates which are greater or less than the rate paid by the trust the sponsor and the affiliated service providers may from timetotime have conflicting demands in respect of their obligations to the trust and in the future to other clients it is possible that future business ventures of the sponsor and the affiliated service providers may generate larger fees resulting in increased payments to employees and therefore incentivizing the sponsor andor the affiliated service providers to allocate ittheir limited resources accordingly to the potential detriment of the trust there is an absence of arms length negotiation with respect to some of the terms of this offering and where applicable there has been no independent due diligence conducted with respect to this offering the sponsor will however not retain any affiliated servicer provider for the trust which the sponsor has reason to believe would knowingly or deliberately favor any other client over the trust the liquidity providers as of the date of this prospectus genesis an affiliate of the trust is the only acting liquidity provider when the administrator acts on behalf of an authorized participant to facilitate the conversion procedures with the liquidity provider it will serve as an independent third party between genesis on the one hand and the    table of contents custodian the sponsor the trust and the shareholders on the other however in its capacity as a liquidity provider genesis may be incentivized to act in favor of the sponsor the trust and the shareholders when conducting the conversion procedures in addition genesis may engage in bitcoin trading with the trusts affiliated entities for example when the sponsor receives the sponsors fee in bitcoins it sells the bitcoins through genesis for this service genesis charges the sponsor a  transaction fee which is not borne by the trust additionally both the sponsors parent company digital currency group and the custodian xapo inc are customers of genesis and may buy or sell bitcoin through genesis from time to time independent of the trust authorized participants may buy and sell bitcoins through liquidity providers other than in connection with orders placed with the trust if an authorized participant provides a more lucrative fee to a liquidity provider for services rendered independent of the trust the liquidity provider may be incentivized to refuse to act as a liquidity provider which could decrease the liquidity of the trust lastly several employees of the sponsor and the sponsors parent company digital currency group inc are finraregistered representatives who maintain their licenses through genesis proprietary tradingother clients because the officers of the sponsor may trade bitcoins for their own personal trading accounts subject to certain internal trading policies and procedures at the same time that they are managing the account of the trust prospective investors should be aware that the activities of the officers of the

uses a trading software platform provided by the index provider to operate its bitcoin trading desk and facilitate genesiss actions as a liquidity provider although the index provider does not currently utilize data from overthecounter markets or derivative platforms per the terms of the license the index provider is entitled to use the overthecounter trading data from genesis in the index under the rules governing the calculation of the bitcoin index price if the sponsor determines in good faith that the index does not reflect an accurate bitcoin price then the administrator will employ an alternative method to determine the bitcoin index price because such a determination could reflect negatively upon the index provider lead to a decrease in the index providers revenue or

that are held as capital assets and does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or consequences of the medicare contribution tax on net investment income if an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes holds shares the us federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership partnerships holding shares and partners in those partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisers about the particular us federal income tax consequences of owning shares this discussion is based on the code administrative pronouncements judicial decisions and final temporary and proposed treasury regulations as of the date hereof changes to any of which subsequent to the date hereof may affect the tax consequences described herein prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisers about the application of the us federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction tax treatment of the trust the sponsor intends to take the position that the trust will be treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes assuming that the trust is a grantor trust the trust will not be subject to us federal income tax rather a pro rata portion of the trusts income gain losses and deductions will flow through to each beneficial owner of shares recent amendments to the trust agreement were intended to clarify the trusts classification as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes to eliminate any ambiguity that the trust since its formation has been intended to be treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes the trust petitioned for and was granted on february   an order of the court of chancery of the state of delaware reforming the trust agreement retroactively to september   the date of the original trust agreement to conform to the    table of contents amendments described in the preceding sentence however special tax counsel to the trust expresses no opinion as to whether and the irs or a court might not agree that the trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes the trust is seeking a ruling from the irs that the trust is a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes but there can be no assurance that the trust will be successful in obtaining such a ruling if the irs were successful in asserting that the trust is not properly classified as a grantor trust the trust might be classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes although due to the uncertain treatment of bitcoins for us federal income tax purposes discussed below there can be no assurance in this regard if the trust were classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes the tax consequences of owning shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein although there might be certain differences including with respect to timing in addition tax information reports provided to shareholders would be made in a different form if the trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for us federal income tax purposes it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes in that event the trust would be subject to entitylevel us federal income tax currently at a maximum rate of  on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the trust to shareholders would be taxable as dividends to the extent of the trusts current and accumulated earnings and profits which in the case of nonus holders as defined below generally would be subject to us federal withholding tax at a  rate or a lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty the remainder of this discussion is based on the assumption that the trust will be treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes uncertainty regarding the us federal income tax treatment of bitcoins as discussed below each beneficial owner of shares generally will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as the owner of an undivided interest in the bitcoins held in the trust many significant aspects of the us federal income tax treatment of bitcoins are uncertain and the sponsor does not intend to request a ruling from the irs on these issues on march   the irs released a notice the notice which discusses certain aspects of the treatment of virtual currencies such as bitcoins for us federal income tax purposes in the notice the irs stated that for us federal income tax purposes i bitcoins are property that is not currency and ii bitcoins may be held as capital assets there can be no assurance however that the irs will not alter its position with respect to bitcoins in the future or that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in the notice in addition legislation has been introduced that would if enacted cause bitcoins to be treated as currency for us federal income tax purposes if bitcoins were properly treated as currency for us federal income tax purposes gain recognized on the disposition of bitcoins would constitute ordinary income and losses recognized on the disposition of bitcoin could be subject to special reporting requirements applicable to reportable transactions the remainder of this discussion assumes that bitcoins are properly treated for us federal income tax purposes as property that is not currency special tax counsel to the trust expresses no opinion regarding these aspects of the us federal income tax treatment of bitcoins the notice does not address other significant aspects of the us federal income tax treatment of bitcoins including i whether bitcoins are properly treated as commodities for us federal income tax purposes ii whether bitcoins are properly treated as collectibles for us federal income tax purposes iii the proper method of determining a holders holding period and tax basis for bitcoins acquired at different times or at varying prices and iv whether and how a holder of bitcoins acquired at different times or at varying prices may designate for us federal income tax purposes which of the bitcoins is transferred in a subsequent sale exchange or other disposition prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the substantial uncertainty regarding the tax consequences of an investment in bitcoins    table of contents tax consequences to us holders as used herein the term us holder means a beneficial owner of a share for us federal income tax purposes that is        an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states for us federal income tax purposes        a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision thereof or        an estate or trust the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source for us federal income tax purposes each us holder will be treated as the owner of an undivided interest in the bitcoins held in the trust and will be treated as directly realizing its pro rata share of the trusts income gains losses and deductions when a us holder purchases shares for cash the us holders initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the bitcoins held in the trust will be equal to the amount paid for the shares this discussion assumes that each us holder will acquire all of its shares for cash on the same date and at the same price per share us holders that acquire or contemplate acquiring multiple lots of shares at different times or prices are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding their tax bases and holding periods in their pro rata shares of the bitcoins held in the trust when the trust transfers bitcoins to the sponsor as payment of the sponsors fee or sells bitcoins to fund payment of any additional trust expenses each us holder will be treated as having sold its pro rata share of those bitcoins for their fair market value at that time which in the case of bitcoins sold by the trust generally will be equal to the cash proceeds received by the trust in respect thereof as a result each us holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between i the fair market value of the us holders pro rata share of the bitcoins that were transferred and ii the us holders tax basis for its pro rata share of the bitcoins that were transferred assuming that bitcoins are not treated as currency for us federal income tax purposes any such gain or loss will generally be shortterm capital gain or loss if the us holder has held its shares for one year or less and longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder has held its shares for more than one year the deductibility of capital losses may be subject to significant limitations a us holders tax basis in its pro rata share of any bitcoins transferred by the trust generally will be determined by multiplying the tax basis of the us holders pro rata share of all of the bitcoins held in the trust immediately prior to the transfer by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of bitcoins transferred and the denominator of which is the total amount of bitcoins held in the trust immediately prior to the transfer immediately after the transfer the us holders tax basis in its pro rata share of the bitcoins remaining in the trust will be equal to the tax basis in its pro rata share of the bitcoins held in the trust immediately prior to the transfer less the portion of that tax basis allocable to its pro rata share of the bitcoins transferred us holders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of the expenses incurred by the trust to the same extent as if the expenses were directly incurred by the us holders us holders pro rata shares of the expenses incurred by the trust will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions for us federal income tax purposes if a us holder is an individual trust or estate the us holders share of these expenses will be deductible for regular us federal income tax purposes only to the extent that the us holders share of the expenses when combined with other miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds  of the us holders adjusted gross income for the particular year will not be deductible for us federal alternative minimum tax purposes and will be subject to certain other limitations on deductibility on a sale or other disposition of shares a us holder will be treated as having sold the bitcoins underlying such shares accordingly the shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between i the amount realized on the sale of the shares and ii the portion of the us holders tax basis in its pro rata share of the bitcoins held in the trust that is attributable to the shares disposed of such tax basis generally will be determined by multiplying the tax basis of the us holders pro rata share of all of the bitcoins held by the trust immediately prior to such sale or other disposition by a fraction the numerator of    table of contents which is the number of shares disposed of and the denominator of which is the total number of shares held by such us holder immediately prior to such sale or other disposition assuming that bitcoins are not treated as currency for us federal income tax purposes that gain or loss will generally be shortterm capital gain or loss if the us holder has held its shares for one year or less and longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder has held its shares for more than one year after any sale or other disposition of fewer than all of a us holders shares the us holders tax basis in its pro rata share of the bitcoins held in the trust immediately after the sale or other disposition generally will equal the tax basis in its pro rata share of the total amount of the bitcoins held in the trust immediately prior to the sale less the portion of that tax basis that is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the us holder upon the sale or other disposition or in the case of a redemption which is treated as the basis of the bitcoins received by the shareholder in the redemption any brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a us holder in purchasing shares will be added to the us holders tax basis in the underlying assets of the trust similarly any brokerage fee or other transaction fee incurred by a us holder in selling shares will reduce the amount realized by the us holder with respect to the sale

accounting policies followed by the trust the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the trust qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting and reporting guidance under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  the trust is not registered under the investment company act of  us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the trust conducts its transactions in bitcoins including receiving bitcoins for the creation of shares payment of bitcoins for the redemption of shares and payment of fees in bitcoins since its inception the trust has not held cash or cash equivalents the trust classifies its investment in bitcoin as a commodity which is consistent with the commodity futures trading commissions indication that bitcoin is considered a commodity under the commodity exchange act investment transactions and revenue recognition the trust considers its investment transactions to be the receipt of bitcoins for share creations and the payment of bitcoins for share redemptions or as payment of expenses the trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments realized gains and losses are calculated using an average cost method realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for fees in bitcoin and share redemptions fair value measurement fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date us gaap utilizes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the trust unobservable inputs reflect the trusts assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows        level   valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the trust has the ability to access since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market these valuations do not entail a significant degree of judgment        level   valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly        level   valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement   f table of contents bitcoin investment trust notes to unaudited financial statements  continued   the availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary by investment to the extent that valuations are based on sources that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment fair value estimates do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized by the trust        march          level       level       level       total   assets

market considered to be the trusts principal market to determine which exchange is the trusts principal market for purposes of calculating the trusts nav the trust considers only bitcoin markets that are us dollardenominated have an online platform and publish transaction price and volume data publicly based on these requirements the trust prepares a list of eligible bitcoin markets and considers the following criteria to select its principal market i the volume of bitcoins traded on a bitcoin market in the prior twelve months ii a bitcoin markets regulatory compliance with applicable federal and state licensing requirements and practices regarding antimoney laundering procedures and iii the degree of intraday price fluctuations a bitcoin market experiences as well as the degree of variance in prices across bitcoin exchanges in determining which of the eligible bitcoin market is the trusts principal market the trust reviews these criteria in the following order first the trust sorts the list of eligible bitcoin markets from high to low by volume of bitcoins traded on each bitcoin market in the prior twelve months the trust moves down the list until it reaches a bitcoin market that has a volume of bitcoins traded for the prior twelve months that is less than  of the next largest bitcoin market and excludes this and all smaller bitcoin exchanges from the list however the list will always contain a minimum of three bitcoin markets even if the percentage of volume drops to less than  of the next largest bitcoin market second the trust reviews the remaining bitcoin markets and excludes any bitcoin markets that do not comply with the federal and state licensing requirements that are applicable to the trust and the authorized participants the trust or an authorized participant can only do business with those bitcoin markets that meet the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which the trust or an authorized participant is registered to do business the trust also assesses each bitcoin markets practices regarding antimoney laundering procedures third the trust then reviews intraday pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on bitcoin markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular bitcoin market the trust then selects a bitcoin market as its principal market based on highest trade volume and price stability in comparison to the other bitcoin markets on the list   f table of contents bitcoin investment trust notes to unaudited financial statements  continued   the trust determines its principal market annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine if i there have been recent changes to each bitcoin markets transaction volume in the prior twelve months ii if any bitcoin markets have fallen out of or come into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements iii if the trust has engaged any new authorized participant that due to being registered to do business in another jurisdiction would make bitcoin markets previously inaccessible to the trust now accessible or iv if recent changes to each bitcoin markets price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the trusts determination of its principal market historically the trust considered bitstamp to be its principal market the trust performed an assessment of the principal market at december   and identified a change in the principal market from bitstamp to global digital asset exchange gdax formerly known as coinbase exchange the trust has applied this change in principal market effective december   as of march   gdax remained the

redemption of baskets on behalf of investors are made by the authorized participant in exchange for the delivery of bitcoins to the trust or the distribution of bitcoins by the trust the number of

risks related to its concentration in a single asset bitcoin investing in bitcoin is currently unregulated highly speculative and volatile the net asset value of the trust relates directly to the value of the bitcoins held by the trust and fluctuations in the price of bitcoins could materially and adversely affect an investment in the shares of the trust the price of bitcoins has a limited history during such history bitcoin prices have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors including the levels of liquidity if bitcoin markets continue to experience significant price fluctuations the trust may experience losses several factors may affect the price of bitcoins including but not limited to global bitcoin supply and demand and competition from other forms of digital currency or payments services the bitcoins held by the trust are commingled and the trusts shareholders have no specific rights to any specific bitcoins in the event of the insolvency of the trust its assets may be inadequate to satisfy a claim by its shareholders there is currently no clearing house for bitcoins nor is there a central or major depository for the custody of bitcoins there is a risk that some or all of the trusts bitcoins could be lost or stolen the trust does not have insurance protection on its bitcoins which exposes the trust and its shareholders to the risk of loss of the trusts bitcoins further bitcoin transactions are irrevocable stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoin may be irretrievable as a result any incorrectly executed bitcoin transactions could

united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement the trust is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trusts internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit also includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles

opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the trust as of december   and  and the results of its operations for each of the years in the twoyear period ended december   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in forming our opinion we have considered the adequacy of the

a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments realized gains and losses are calculated using an average cost method realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for fees in bitcoins and share redemptions fair value measurement fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date us gaap utilizes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the trust unobservable inputs reflect the trusts assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows        level   valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the trust has the ability to access since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market these valuations do not entail a significant degree of judgment        level   valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly        level   valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement the availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary by investment to the extent that valuations are based on sources that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment fair value estimates do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized by the trust        december          level       level       level       total   assets             investment in bitcoin                     

trusts nav the trust considers only bitcoin markets that are us dollardenominated have an online platform and publish transaction price and volume data publicly based on these requirements the trust prepares a list of eligible bitcoin markets and considers the following criteria to select its principal market i the volume of bitcoins traded on a bitcoin market in the prior twelve months ii a bitcoin markets regulatory compliance with applicable federal and state licensing requirements and practices regarding antimoney laundering procedures and iii the degree of intraday price fluctuations a bitcoin market experiences as well as the degree of variance in prices across bitcoin exchanges in determining which of the eligible bitcoin market is the trusts principal market the trust reviews these criteria in the following order first the trust sorts the list of eligible bitcoin markets from high to low by volume of bitcoin traded on each bitcoin market in the prior twelve months the trust moves down the list until it reaches a bitcoin market that has a volume of bitcoins traded for the prior twelve months that is less than  of the next largest bitcoin market and excludes this and all smaller bitcoin exchanges from the list however the list will always contain a minimum of three bitcoin markets even if the percentage of volume drops to less than  of the next largest bitcoin market second the trust reviews the remaining bitcoin market and excludes any bitcoin markets that do not comply with the federal and state licensing requirements that are applicable to the trust and the authorized participants the trust or an authorized participant can do business only with those bitcoin markets that meet the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which the trust or an authorized participant is registered to do business the trust also assesses each bitcoin markets practices regarding antimoney laundering procedures third the trust then reviews intraday pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on bitcoin markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular bitcoin market the trust then selects a bitcoin market as its principal market based on highest trade volume and price stability in comparison to the other bitcoin markets on the list the trust determines its principal market annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine if i there have been recent changes to each bitcoin markets transaction volume in the prior twelve months ii if any bitcoin market have fallen out of or come into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements iii if the trust has engaged any new authorized participant that due to being registered to do business in another jurisdiction would make bitcoin markets previously inaccessible to the trust now accessible or iv if recent changes to each bitcoin marketss price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the trusts determination of its principal market historically the trust considered bitstamp to be its principal market with an exception for the period of january   through january   when the trust relied on pricing from bitfinex on january   bitstamp suffered a disruption of operations and in accordance with the trusts procedures for determining its principal market the trust relied upon bitfinex until january   when the trust determined that bitstamp was again able to be relied upon as the principal market the trust performed an assessment of the principal market at december   and identified a change in the principal market from bitstamp to global digital asset exchange gdax formerly known as coinbase exchange the trust has applied this change in principal market effective december   and has valued bitcoins held by the trust at december   using the gdax exchange   f table of contents

are made by the authorized participant in exchange for the delivery of bitcoins to the trust or the distribution of bitcoins by the trust the number of bitcoins required for each creation basket or redemption basket is determined by dividing the number of bitcoins owned by the trust at such time by the number of shares outstanding at such time and multiplying the quotient obtained by  each share

of each share to investors the authorized participant may realize significant profits buying selling creating and redeeming shares as a result of changes in the value of shares or bitcoins effective october   the trust suspended its redemption program in which shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their shares through the authorized participant out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of regulation m under the securities exchange act resulting in a settlement reached with the securities exchange commission the trust is seeking an exemption from the securities and exchange commission sec under regulation m in order to reinstate its redemption program but the distributorauthorized participant and the trust cannot at this time predict the timeline of receiving an exemption or whether the trust will be permitted to reinstate the share redemption program for the benefit of shareholders on july   the trust entered into a settlement agreement with the sec pursuant to which it agreed to a ceaseanddesist order against future violations of rules  and  of regulation m resulting in a negligible fee disgorgement by the authorized participant with no financial impact to the trust however such settlement did not enable the trust to reinstate the share redemption program on january   in connection with and prior to the initial filing of the form s with the sec the trust stopped issuing shares under the creation program which had been taking place through private placement transactions  income taxes the trust is intended to be treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes and if the trust is so treated the shareholders will be treated as owning proportionate interests in the trust for us federal income tax purposes in that case the trust therefore would not be subject to us federal income tax   f table of contents bitcoin investment trust notes to the financial statements  continued   instead each shareholder would be deemed to acquire and hold a proportionate interest in the trusts assets and will be required to report its proportionate share of the trusts gains income losses and expenses on its us federal income tax returns in accordance with the shareholders method of accounting however there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with this conclusion and it is possible that the irs could assert a position to the contrary to one or all of those conclusions and that a court could sustain that contrary conclusion as of january   an amendment to the trust agreement was made regarding certain tax provisions on february   the court of chancery of the state of delaware ordered that the original trust agreement be reformed so that the amendments made would be retroactive to the original date of execution of the agreement the trust is seeking a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certainty for its tax position and is unable to predict a timeline of when a ruling will occur or whether a favorable outcome will be received the sponsor of the trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of december   or december    related parties the trust considers the following entities and their directors to be related

to its concentration in a single asset bitcoins   investing in bitcoins is currently unregulated highly speculative and volatile   f table of contents bitcoin investment trust notes to the financial statements  continued   the net asset value of the trust relates directly to the value of the bitcoins held by the trust and fluctuations in the price of bitcoins could materially and adversely affect an investment in the shares of the trust the price of bitcoins has a limited history during such history bitcoin prices have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors including the levels of liquidity if bitcoin markets continue to experience significant price fluctuations the trust may experience losses several factors may affect the price of bitcoins including but not limited to global bitcoin supply and demand theft of bitcoins from global exchanges or vaults and competition from other forms of digital currency or payments services the bitcoins held by the trust are commingled and the trusts shareholders have no specific rights to any specific bitcoins in the event of the insolvency of the trust its assets may be inadequate to satisfy a claim by its shareholders there is currently no clearing house for bitcoins nor is there a central or major depository for the custody of bitcoins there is a risk that some or all of the trusts bitcoins could be lost or stolen the trust does not have insurance protection on its bitcoins which exposes the trust and its shareholders to the risk of loss of the trusts bitcoins further bitcoin transactions are irrevocable stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoins may be irretrievable as a result any incorrectly executed bitcoin transactions could adversely affect an investment in the trust as of august   the trust and sponsor have transitioned the role of the custodian to xapo to fulfill all custodial obligations of the trust which were formerly the responsibility of dcg holdco dcg holdco no longer serves as a custodian of the trust in any capacity the sponsors parent an affiliate of the trust holds a minority interest in xapo that represents less than  of xapos ownership to the extent private keys for bitcoin addresses are lost destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private keys are accessible the trust may be unable to access the bitcoins held in the associated address and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the bitcoin network the processes by which bitcoin transactions are settled are dependent on the bitcoin peertopeer network and as such the trust is subject to operational risk a risk also exists with respect to previously unknown technical vulnerabilities which may adversely affect the value of bitcoin as of the close of business on

lines mostly reflect the state of the computer industry apple’s stagnant product lines mostly reflect the state of the computer industry by joel hruska on august   at  am comment most of apple’s product lines are severely overdue for a refresh apart from the recently refreshed macbook many of the company’s mac products are well over a year old the mac mini is nearly two the highend workstation mac pro is almost three and the sole remaining nonretina macbook pro is now more than four years oldwriting for the verge sam byford recently argued that “apple should stop selling four yearold computers” he’s not wrong to note the era macbook pro is pretty long in the tooth with its gb of ram and ivy bridgebased processor or that apple has neglected specific products like the mac mini i thought about writing a similar article last month but with a specific focus on the mac pro after digging around in intel’s ark a tool that lets you compare the specifics of various intel processors i realized that while there are exceptions apple’s relatively lax refresh cycle is mostly driven by the low rate of improvements in pc hardware these days apple is just more honest about it meet the new cpu same as the old cpusetting aside the nonretina macbook pro from  most of apple’s laptops are running on broadwell or skylake the  macbook there’s a single sku left over from haswell at the  price point but the laptop lineup is pretty newbyford is right when he calls out the nearly threeyear gap between the mac pro’s debut and the present day but he doesn’t specifically discuss just how little this has meant to the machine’s top end performance the mac pro ships in two configurations we’ll address an ivy bridge xeon quadcore at ghz with mb l e v or a ghz core ivbep cpu with mb l e v let’s compare those with their counterparts todayin the chart above we’ve arranged each ivb chip on the left followed by its modern counterpart intel doesn’t have a core broadwell chip in the w tdp bracket only in w and w flavors there are highercore count systems with lower clock speeds but our hypothetical testcase is a user who wants both high clocks and high core countsthe first thing to note is how little intel’s chip lineup has actually changed in the past three years the modern e v has a slightly higher base clock speed but a significantly higher tdp top frequency is identical between the two broadwell offers essentially no clock speed improvements over ivbe at the quadcore level — in fact the ivbep actually clocked higher than its counterpart true architectural improvements will compensate for some of this but not by much — haswell was roughly  faster than ivbe and skylake hasn’t come to the e family yet you’d get some uplift if your application supports and makes significant use of avx but otherwise there’s not a lot of upgrade to be hadin short there’s just not much reason to update the mac pro’s cpu — not until and unless intel can field designs that truly merit it while apple will likely eventually refresh the mac pro the only big winners will be mac users who want to pack as many threads as possible into a singlesocket system intel now offers xeons with up to  cores in the e familywhat about gpusgpus are where the lengthy wait times in between refresh cycles really does bite customers the current topend mac pro fields a pair of d graphics cards based on amd’s original gcn  architecture amd has built multiple cards that could’ve been used to upgrade these configurations while the polaris gpu inside the rx  would deliver better performance and more vram at a much lower tdp and price pointthe problem with criticizing apple’s gpu performance is that apple doesn’t care all that much about graphics period os x continues to field a version of opengl that’s nearly six years old and apple isn’t supporting vulkan instead choosing to field its own closetometal api metal apple isn’t exactly out of step with the rest of the industry outside of boutique laptops there just aren’t very many systems shipping with discrete gpus any more — at least not many below the  price point and not with decent graphics hardware if your workloads depend on gpus and scale with graphics horsepower you aren’t using apple there are plenty of workloads that run better on gpus than cpus but don’t actually scale all that well which is why i make that distinctionfor a brief moment in  with the launch of the mac pro it looked like apple might embrace opencl gpgpu programming and offload and put a new focus on integrating highend gpus into its various products that moment has come and gone while i do suspect we’ll see apple hardware with refreshed graphics hardware it’ll be the nm refresh cycle that drives it not any particular interest in gpu computing or graphics as a whole so… where’s that leave usi’m not an apple apologist i use an iphone granted but i’m still back on the c and i plan to use it until the screen cracks or the battery dies posts like this inevitably ignite arguments over whether apple devices are worth paying for and whether a different manufacturer offers more value at a given price point spoiler alert oftentimes they do though you may have to do an infuriating amount of searching before finding a system you actually likeit’s been a while since apple updated its hardware some of that hardware could be better than it is and the net result would be systems that were at least a little sexier than they are today but apple has kept updating most of its laptop lines to take advantage of better battery life and performance improvements while the performance of desktop cpus has largely stagnated is it ignoring gpus yes — but that’s completely par for apple the mac pro in  was unusual precisely because it put gpu compute first and foremost apple’s decision to mostly ignore the segment afterwards might be unfortunate but it’s scarcely surprisingapple has held off on making fundamental platform changes precisely because it’s been waiting for the underlying technology to advance enough to make the changes worthwhile given the frustration of sorting through hundreds of nearly identical laptops from multiple manufacturers every time a friend or family member asks for help choosing a laptop i’m not sure i can blame them tagged in appleintelipadmacimacmac prolaptopworkstationmacintoshcomputer post a comment comment the running vm a  core xeon is enough to last  to  years in operation or even longer such are the meaningful changes of intel cpus why fix something that isn’t broken ta because apple is all about “image” and their image is getting tarnished by not releasing new and innovative designs leaving old computer in their product lineup is like watching grapes wither on the vine the running vm you mist my point by a long shot why would i upgrade a computer with a  core xeon and gb of ram when it still works perfectly well for my needs httpwwwflickrcomphotoscatchphotography h it may work today but for the person in  it will be very outdated by  let alone  this only makes sense for the people in  and  to get miles to  or  thus the other oem’s and hardware makers refreshing products with advancement also productivity gets a massive boost in new hardware more than you think so why buy older hardware for poorer productivity when the purpose of buying highend hardware is usually productivity trparky here’s the problem with your thinking in most situations you’re not going to see much of a performance boost when upgrading from an older cpu to a newer cpu at least not like we saw years ago years ago we saw performance boosts in leaps and bounds but today we barely see a  increase in performance when upgrading our cpus there is one piece of hardware where if you do replace it you will see a huge performance boost and that is the hard drive replace your boot device with an ssd and all of a sudden even an older machine will feel like new again we’ve come to the point where cpus are far more powerful than most people need however our biggest performance bottleneck is disk io latency and bandwidth if you can’t get the data to the cpu it doesn’t matter how fast your cpu is your system is going to be slow bluetooth that’s a good point and apple has really been at the forefront in using the new nvmexpress standard for fast ssd data transfer the running vm most m ssds are fast enough nowadays merckel good advice to upgrade to ssd i’m rocking a ″ mbp with a new ssd and the machine still functions very well albeit with an older panel not retina sam kennedy it depends on the task and what your talking about floating point performance usually see’s a greater increase as well as various other areas such as battery life and tdp i upgraded a  year old cpu and it was close to a  increase it was the same model just  years newer k regardless of whether its  a cycle baseline or higher i would not find it acceptable to spend  dollars on a laptop with a  year old cpu in it thats just apple being lazy or cheap and nothing more if they want to be lazy and not update the design thats fine but at least release computers with new cpu’s when those cpu’s come out other smaller and less successful manufacturers manage to do it every cycle apple doesnt have an excuse joel hruska ” i would not find it acceptable to spend  dollars on a laptop with a  year old cpu in it” there are two laptops where this is the case the  haswell and the old ivy bridge macbook pro nonretina that system will probably get killed off in the near future most of apple’s laptops use broadwell or skylake httpwwwflickrcomphotoscatchphotography h why would you assume that we all didn’t know that the performance and efficiency gains on cpu is still apparent in benchmarks the system also would benefit greatly from graphics upgrades memory upgrades and hard drove upgrade the entire system needs to be yupgraded merckel meanwhile the pc copycats keep following apple’s design as the article above stated there aren’t compelling reasons for apple to upgrade with marginally improved chips sam kennedy other manufacturers that are much less successful than apple manage to do it every cycle i dont see what apple’s excuse is aside from greed or laziness they dont need to update the design  just ship with new cpu’s when they are available martian monkey agreed i’m running a mac pro   everything still runs pretty smooth on it but just to keep it current i’m going to upgrade the video card to an amd  amazing that it can run something like that soon i’ll be able to put in newer cpus and it’ll spec very close to newer machines i’ll quite possibly get another  years out of it it’s simply one of the best computers i’ve ever owned sam kennedy well if someone wanted to buy the current mac pro they could get a computer x better for about  of the price or buy  computers over that  year life cycle for the same price also apple’s all in ones are very upgradeable you can watch a linus tech tips video on it meaning that unless your willing to deal with the option detailed above  computer for the price of  better computers no one will be in your situation any time soon martian monkey i wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy the current mac pro i agree about the all in one’s upgradability there’s a healthy aftermarket in that regard however i disagree about ‘my situation’ i’ve been involved with computers since the s and if one thing has become abundantly clear is that cheaper tech is not the same i’m willing to pay for apple’s premium because the parts are better and they work together with a minimum of fuss i’d rather drop  on parts to upgrade my mac pro than on some noname pc that will start acting crazy in two years i work on an acer pc at my day job so i’m not whistling dixie here uniquename “i’d rather drop  on parts to upgrade my mac pro than on some noname pc that will start acting crazy in two years” as someone who’s also been “involved with computers since the ’s” i built my own  years ago and haven’t had an issue since someday soon i’ll upgrade the graphics it’ll take  minutes and cost nearly nothing i get why people buy offtheshelf laptops but why any slightly knowledgeable person would shell out for a name brand desktop — and then claim that the “parts are better and they work together with a minimum of fuss” — will forever be a mystery to me martian monkey i’m really glad you haven’t had issues for  years i mean it not sarcastically but i’ve been burned so many times by pcs i don’t even go down that path anymore every time i’ve troubleshot such inexplicable and weird issues i can’t even begin to list them driver incompatibilities are well documented problems and i don’t want to deal with them anymore ever try to troubleshoot a cintiq in windows  simplicity viruses and exploitability are all concerns that aren’t something you have to deal with on a mac for the most part not saying they don’t exist but they aren’t daily concerns httpwwwflickrcomphotoscatchphotography h for the person that purchased it initially yes… and …but not for the person purchasing the same hardware in the last  years…see the massive flaw in your logic the shambolic skeptic it’s not about getting  years out of an investment – it’s about appl keeping current so us paying top dollar are getting current part gpus included je there are some updates to the intel chips that are not visible in ark but that can be rather important the processorperclock improvements are rather impressive when added up over a few generations say  per gen also haswell made big improvement in how efficient the hyperthreads are not to mention improvements in vtx performance and overall power consumption is making big strides in recent generations an ivy bridge laptop is a total disgrace today all laptops sold should be broadwell or newer really the servers especially for computeintense parallel software and virtualized workloads benefit from newer xeons bluetooth the main problem is that software which is designed to be backwards compatible will not use these new commands but for servers then you can take advantage of the newest but it doesn’t apply here trparky why should i even think about upgrading i have a windows desktop pc and it’s got an ivy bridge i cpu k in it it does everything i need it to do and more i’ve upgraded the video card twice in it i’ll run this machine until it’s dead joel hruska i’m not aware of any improvements haswell made to hyperthreading performance in realworld scenarios haswell added execution units and boosted internal cache memory which could indirectly improve ht performance but ht scaling is still typically around  counting forward from ivy bridge you’ve got the following progression ivb – haswell  roughly  haswell – broadwell   broadwell – skylake   but these gains have often come at the price of reduced core clocks as intel tries to squeeze into smaller form factors so while it’s absolutely true that newer chips offer better battery life for example the topend performance is often only modestly improved power efficiency gains not raw speed is what drives most upgrades these days jeremyg well that’s not fully correct the jump from haswell to sky for mobile did massive wonders for the surface line in the  range httpimagesanandtechcomgraphsgraphpng why because thermals are so much better and heat is the real performance killer obviously a thinner lighter quieter and most importantly faster macbook pro would be welcomed by all joel hruska sure i was considering desktop perf not laptop but yes — in systems where thermals are a significant limitation any improvement to power consumption can be translated into significant perf gains brandon dang great article with an astute and levelheaded discussion adds something to think about as i’m looking to buy a macbook pro and the blogosphere is swimming with “it’s gonna be big because we’ve been waiting and that’s the only reason” so time will tell and this will be my most interesting wait mademac agree the only reason i upgraded my  imac with gb ram and  tb hard drive to a new mbp was that the imac died no other reason i do intensive excel work and lots of indesign graphics speed on mew mbp is great due to the ssd don’t need a tb drive anymore now have switched to using cloud httpwwwfunstufftoseecom dozerman maybe it is that the new hotness isn’t computers anymore lord cheeseburger the mac line up is still great it’s growing in sales every quarter and people don’t replace their computers very often anymore the only people who care are the  of technophile nerds who masturbate over the latest cpu the actual performance of a their lineup in the hands of  of the population is still wonderful even  years later daniel revas “the only people who care are the  of technophile nerds who masturbate over the latest cpu” gaming computers are the only segment experiencing yearoveryear growth i doubt that it is only “” trparky games are more dependent upon gpus than cpus daniel revas yet more and more games are listing quad core cpu’s as required and older quad cpu’s like the athlon phenom series don’t cut it trparky correct me if i’m wrong but aren’t most games still singlethreaded cpu beasts joel hruska no many games these days — at least popular aaa titles — are at least dualthreaded many are quadthreaded it’s true that the scaling isn’t always very strong from two to four threads but most titles pick up at least some benefit from additional cores i’m not sure if there are any games that actually require a quad core there are some titles that specify four threads but intel’s core i dualcore with ht is usually sufficient for them daniel revas most yes but games like bf scale beyond  cores bluetooth is this any better for other manufacturers i think the main problem is intel switching from ticktock to processarchitectureoptimization last march and thus delaying all chips humansauce the cheapest chinese manufacturer is capable of doing incremental cpugpu updates i’m a network architect in a  user environment who has been the advocate that allowed mac’s in our environment apple lost me if they lost me they are in trouble i was a fanboy i’m so pissed i’m ditching my iphone too the running vm you are expecting a gpu upgrade from apple of all people merckel did you read the article incremental updates are marginal ones apple will very likely be coming out with new mbp in sept if they had updated the processors to skylake in june those customers would have been pissed it they bought on the eve of new designs this fall is that so hard to understand jeremyg the rmbp line is well over a year old updating in march or february would have been the right move every other computer manufacture managed to do it with much lower sales getting  improvement at the same cost does make sense how is that so hard to understand httpwwwflickrcomphotoscatchphotography h nm gpu’s intended for mobile  watts will give gpu a boost in pc laptops and hopefully mac amd’s ssg sounds perfect for a macpro tonyia “the problem with criticizing apple’s gpu performance is that apple doesn’t care all that much about graphics” – so because apple doesn’t care about graphics the rest of the world should forget about it that has to be the worst validation for a companies poor representation that i have ever heard “there just aren’t very many systems shipping with discrete gpus any more — at least not many below the  price point” – i didn’t think apple sold any mac pro as referenced for under  so does this comment even apply to apple i’m always amazed when comparing to apple writers chose the lowest end pc that costs sometimes a thousand dollars less and then say “look it works the same as that computer” when they were never in the same league if this article wanted to be nonbiased it would have compared a comparable priced new pc with an new apple pc and then said “how does the hardware compare within the same price range” sure apples tighter software integration would mitigate some of the hardware difference but not nearly as much as this article tries to imply my wife wants a faster mac…there is no option she’s stuck with her slow and tired mac for now and the foreseeable future lord cheeseburger the mac mini is like  and the low end macbook air is  last time i looked tonyia true my comment was poorly written the paragraph above and below his statement references the mac pro not the mini or air so i’ve corrected my comment to reflect that of course given how quickly you replied maybe they do joel hruska “”there just aren’t very many systems shipping with discrete gpus any more — at least not many below the  price point” – i didn’t think apple sold any mac pro as referenced for under  so does this comment even apply to apple” sorry that was a mobile market statement apologies for it being unclear here’s what i’m saying  apple doesn’t care about graphics  apple has never cared about graphics  if you buy apple hardware you probably don’t care about graphics performance either or apple’s limited performance is good enough for whatever you’re doing if you continue to buy apple hardware after being demonstrably shown that apple continues to notcare about graphics and your work or pleasure depends on high levels of graphics performance well that’s not very smart alex gollner on the other hand apple’s move to gpu compute for imovie and final cut pro x has made them much better at dealing with compositing jobs that adobe and avid have problems with the proapps team care very much about gpu power they may be only a mm business for apple but the wider organisation likes the idea of having highend creative tools running on macs and macos i think you are right that apple are more honest than their competition but hp seem to be spending millions on trying to attract highend mac users over to their kit given that gpu power is at the heart of final cut and as it is the perfect demo app for high end computers even mainstream journalists understand what video editing is i hope the macpro and macbook pro has been waiting for the new gpu hotness that has been coming out this summer eg for macbook pro mobile version of nvidia gtx  desktop card is  and for macpro a custom version of nvidia gtx   apple have been known to switch gpu suppliers between generations of same model mac ps i’m only getting fps stitching a  gopro video panorama in kolor autopano video pro on the era gpu in my macbook so i hope apple do change things up in october joel hruska don’t mistake gpu acceleration for scaling well with higherend gpus i observed this on numerous occasions when benchmarking workstation cards you can get a kick moving from a cpu to a gpu but adding higherend gpus rarely shows performance improvements at the rate one might expect typically you get a fairly static onetime jump with relatively minor improvements from higherend cards so the d on a mac pro might be  faster than using the cpu but the d might only be  faster than the d exactly how it all plays out will depend on workload application and tuning of course bhesse apple really needs to dump amd and make at least one professional level computer with the latest nvidia cards i’ve been having to build my own hackintosh builds to get decent performance for my neural networks in os x these past few years it’s absolutely ridiculous that apple’s ‘best’ gpu is from … the running vm agreed but amd gives them cheeper prices linuxcooldude apple is not too interested in nvidia cuda as it locks in users to specific applications with amd a lot more is open source to utilize it without restrictions jd i’d be fine with a stagnant computer if they lowered the prices as the machines aged keeping a  macbook pro at roughly  prices when the marginal price of components and construction has fallen is price gouging sure they can get away with it and it may make sense for their bottom line but that doesn’t mean we have to like it like them or like tim cook for doing so they’d rather maintain premium brand appearance among those who don’t know any better at the cost of appearing like jerks to those of us who do and all for the sake of profits they don’t even know what to do with grandpuba i set a rule for myself regarding apple many years ago never depend on apple products when it comes to my livelihood through the decades i have seen apple flip on its partners and customers so many times that i know better than to trust them apple products are for fun or for general use not for work the running vm i use them for development d if that isn’t considered work then i don’t know what is grandpuba dangerous choice the running vm please elaborate grandpuba why should i you will learn on your own flesh the running vm zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz you lack credibility grandpuba a dark fate awaits you  mcassar  i have worked professionally with mac’s for over  years in the broadcast field before that i used a pc to me it’s not about the hardware but the os and osx is just more solid and more reliable when you need to meet an urgent deadline you can’t afford to mess about tom scharf how can you possibly expect a company that only makes b in profit a year to spend the huuuuuuuge amount money it would take to upgrade their machines with new boards that intel literally did all the hard work on this is absolutely unreasonable lostalone apple definitely suffers the most from the slow down in development they have focused their whole company around the image of innovation and now they can’t make good on that pcs are cheaper and have copied all the interesting and different ideas like all in one systems and unibody aluminium laptops and now it’s a lot harder for apple to stand out they’re stuck using the same parts as everything else and dressing them up as more innovative some how and charging more too and that’s not a recipe for success they are very much following now the lacklustre ipad pro being presented as a surfacetype tablet and doing so quite poorly is a great example don truth is unless you are gaming or producing media the average  year old laptop or the average  year old desktop is more than capable of daily tasks we are almost at that point where computers will last the same age as a microwave or a fridge even most people replace them when they break not because they are outdated mekhios still using my  macbook air fully loaded still works perfectly is fast and i see no reason to upgrade it harrison ford while you’re not wrong that apple doesn’t “care” about gpus it doesn’t excuse the fact that they don’t care about gpus it seems that cpus have plateaued for now but gpus have not and a lot of the important developments in computing in the last years have been gpu bound such as vr there’s no excuse for apple ditching gpgpu and it’s incredibly myopic to look at computers as just a cpu with incidental gpus hooked up to them gpus are what allowed smartphones and tablets to take over the market the cpu of a phone is relatively pathetic but the gpu is pretty amazing and it’s not just the gpu there’s ram and a number of other things there’s no excuse to be made for apple they just don’t have a vision any more calling that “honest” is far more charitable than they deserve joel hruska unfortunately i can’t really call apple out for pricing ram upgrades on hardware are almost always ridiculously expensive with multiple manufacturers moving to soldered ram for many systems they charge just as much as apple does for upgrades what i’m calling honest is the fact that they don’t update hardware — as opposed to updating it and then attempting to respin incredibly marginal improvements as huge leaps daniel glass i think the biggest sin in the current mac pro’s design is in completely ignoring the preexisting user base that had been clamoring for an updated version of the big broadly useful desktop for the line in favor of a supercompact unit that can’t be upgraded or take pcipcie cards without an expensive bottlenecking thunderbolt external enclosure but that’s par for the course for apple and pro users for the last decade or so such as switching from powerpc to intel but giving software devs only about a year to completely rewrite their code which wasn’t a big deal for some but adobe had done a lot of architecturespecific optimization on creative suite that dragged them to a crawl on intel procs running osx joel hruska that’s a valid point for sure there were some customers who faced having to migrate their storage arrays to thunderbolt external drives simply because apple felt like removing drive bays don’t blame them for being upset thunderbolt shouldn’t practically be a perf bottleneck on storage in the majority of cases since most people don’t use vast raid arrays that would saturate a pcie  x connection — but i’m sure there were exceptions daniel glass not just storage though there’s also taskspecific cards that were built to run on the pcie bus that would be choked over thunderbolt joel hruska hrm i can’t speak to that without knowing more in consumer hardware only gpus and highspeed storage arrays can push enough data to really bottleneck the thunderbolt bus but there’s definitely a latency hit associated with thunderbolt mostly because the controller hangs off the southbridge as opposed to the cpu gpu tests on tbolt typically show a roughly  performance hit but i can see how this could happen if you had highend video capture cards for example the pcie  x link in tbolt  wouldn’t be enough for highspeed video capture without bottlenecking daniel glass there’s also the choice between having multiple enclosures so each gets a full tbolt link or trying to make do with a  card box croc you could say the same thing for the mobile devices and there is actually little need for iphone  to exist with its small incremental changes plus hardware improvement is more than just cpu and gpu the screen on that mba is a disgrace apple created the mb and mba years ago not because it needed new enclosure for a fancy new cpu winding the clock back  years and if apple had the same outdated product line do you think it would have survived frank apple really needs to allow the os to run on nonapple hardware it would provide much needed competition to the desktop that linux doesn’t seem to provoke there is nothing special or proprietary about a mac except the rom httpwwwengadgetcom jon fingas no it absolutely shouldn’t and that’s not because i’m trying to defend the status quo it’s because you’re suggesting that apple throw out the very thing that makes it successful apple at its heart is a hardware company it’s not just that it gets its big profits from hardware sales it’s that macos thrives on tight integration between hardware and software it can support true k displays as opposed to the grafted dual displays you see from pc vendors because it customdeveloped hardware to make that happen it was first with trackpad gestures because it custombuilt the trackpads the first to use thunderbolt because it helped design the spec and so on the hardware is what lets its software shine if you let macos run on thirdparty pcs you end up in microsoft’s boat that means targeting the lowest common denominator of hardware compiling catalogues of thousands of drivers… and having to attach your name to pieces of crap do you really want macos to be associated with the flimsy laptop you found at best buy with the dodgy trackpad washedout display and hour battery life one of the reasons microsoft started the surface line was to fix windows’ reputation for garbage hardware to show vendors how a computer should be made besides apple actually tried allowing mac clones in the mids it nearly killed the company and many credit jobs’ decision to kill clones with contributing to apple’s turnaround there’s no indication that apple would fare any better if it made that choice in  especially not when the overall pc market is on the decline frank apple used to be a hardware company now it is a branding company with a pretty good user interface for freebsd they could sell the os for  a pop and still keep the profitability the clone wars may or may not have hurt apple many business will not buy equipment if there is only one supplier so apple may have made inroads into industry that it wouldn’t without the clones apple was hurt by os  and powerpc being largely incompatible with os  hardware or software they did a dead drop of support for  years worth of customers not an infrequent event for apple check the compatibility of os  and  httpsenwikipediaorgwikimacos httpsenwikipediaorgwikimacos the powerpc combined with os x was a truly superior machine for its time as is the power  chip today but that was a long time ago oh it was the ipod itunes and the iphone that saved apple httpstevejobsdailyquotecommilkingmac madrino i’ve been an avid apple user since the introduction of the macintosh unfortunately the misguided steps of beats watch and other noncore products show a lack of focus by the company for leading edge products it has become a gadget company outsourcing manufacturing for compromised products where return on investment is the only goal without a significant upgrade to the macpro and imac this year i will no longer be purchasing any of their products httpwwwengadgetcom jon fingas they updated the imac late last year though i’m using that model right now in fact and it’s entirely likely that you’ll see at least a mild refresh to it this year the gnome i’d love a new macbook pro but honestly the idea that mine has been solid for years and i haven’t had to worry about upgrading to get the latest new thing has been refreshing thats not to say i’m not looking forward to something soon… and i hope that one can stay “recent” for a few years after as for microsoft and the surface um yea they do have to keep iterating because its arguably still junk maybe windows is more to blame joel hruska people i know seem fairly happy with the latest iteration of surface i haven’t reviewed one since the original surface  surface pro so i can’t comment much mahmet tokarev tajik pride lol at this pathetic attempt to rationalize apple selling ancient hardware at wildly overblown prices with gigantic profit margins… just another day in the life of a lobotomized apple cult droneslave joel hruska did you miss the part where i don’t own any apple laptops desktops or allinones i have an iphone c that i bought when my old phone broke and radio shack sold it to me for  i’m a more expensive date then that buddy  voidincarnate uh… nope variable refresh rate high refresh rate hdr display vulkan thunderbolt usb c hdmi bdp  these are all technologies missing from apple’s desktop hahaha lineup with only the macbook  supporting tbusbc and even that does not hit the advertised transfer speeds high refresh rates are not just for gaming i run my desktop at  hz because it divides nicely into both  fps and  fps video content making watching tv and movies much smoother than on my secondary  hz monitor it’s not just about core counts and gigabytes the user experience matters joel hruska gsyncfreesync hz displays hdr tbolt  hdmi b dp  are all extremely uncommon in the pc notebook space boutique systems are the only places you’re going to find them outside of hdmi b which can be had from nv or i think skylakeclass gpus amd hasn’t launched the notebook variants of the gpus that support those features yet it’s true that apple could update and refresh those features but it’s not like the pc industry is shipping them in large numbers either as for vulkan apple isn’t supporting it — but if it chose to vulkan could run on the amd gpus it already ships zoran apple is using old hardware with mac pro…if they wanted to be current they could use xeon e v with  cpu cores  threads x  cpus   cpu cores  threads and that would completely blow away old expensive mac pro httparkintelcomproductsintelxeonprocessorevmcacheghz joel hruska the mac pro isn’t dualsocket though so that’s a nogo they could offer an core cpu but i addressed this that’s only useful to a limited customer base that can use them if you need fewer cores and more clock the benefits are much smaller zoran the point is that apple are not using current hardware…whether your application needs it or not is not necessarily the point many power users including me need high end hardware and unfortunately apple simply does not deliver the old dual socket mac pro was far more versatile than current mac pro which is just a pretty toy with limited expansion joel hruska “the old dual socket mac pro was far more versatile than current mac pro which is just a pretty toy with limited expansion” agreed but that was true in  “the point is that apple are not using current hardware…whether your application needs it or not is not necessarily the point ” i disagree that’s exactly the point which would you rather have  a situation in which a company doesn’t upgrade a product because it can’t deliver a tangible benefit this means that if you bought your hardware in  you don’t feel like you’re getting fleeced by ads for new products that aren’t actually better  a situation in which a company upgrades hardware to remain current but doesn’t actually offer any benefits they use marketing to imply benefits that don’t actually meaningfully exist as a consumer i prefer  some people might prefer  i suppose zoran your original assertion was “meet the new cpu same as the old cpu” that is simply not true…cpus have advanced significantly and many high end applications need more powerful cpus many users high end users like me are now using alternate powerful workstations like dell precision or hp z which use current technology intel xeon e v cpus there is a significant market for high end workstations and traditionally apple used to value high end users…yet apple are now making to much money on consumer technology to care about their high end users they are no longer keeping up if you need high end workstation look at alternatives joel hruska all comparisons are made relative to two things  what the company has previously sold and  what’s available on the market i specifically state above that my comparison point is chosen to represent consumers who need both high clock speeds and solid core counts not all applications scale out well past a certain point photoshop for example doesn’t take advantage of higher core counts past about quadcores other applications have their own limits i can’t profile every single application that a person might use and the purpose of this article was not to evaluate whether the mac pro was or was not a good fit for any given workload if for example you have an application that is embarrassingly parallel and can multithread for any number of cpu cores then you probably don’t own a mac pro and this article does not apply to you you can as you note buy a s system with intel xeon e v not v processors that’s  cores   threads but if you need  threads in a single system you’re not buying a mac pro and again — i note that the one upgrade that apple could offer would be a higher core count but if you’re a user who cares about cpu core count and clock speed then a core chip at ghz may not be faster than the core chip at ghz zoran once again…apple have completely neglected high end users that require powerful cpus for rendering simulations transcoding development running multiple vms my use case if user needs high core count apple could offer xeon e v with ghz cpus ghz max with mb cache cpu with  cores and support for fast ddr memory httparkintelcomproductsintelxeonprocessorevmcacheghz if not all cpu cores are being used the remaining cores can run at ghz and still remain under thermal threshold…this combined with larger caches and faster memory would blow away the old mac pro furthermore if you have an application with a large working set footprint that not fit in much smaller cache footprint on old mac pro with ev then you have to access slow memory memory bandwidthlatency is a huge factor in applications performance lets say you have a ghz cpu and your memory is only ghz and the data is not in cache…then your cpu has to wait slow down to ghz to access memory for more details see httpswwwcsvirginiaedustream if user requires fastest possible single threaded performance apple could offer ik  httparkintelcomproductsintelcoreikprocessormcacheuptoghz apple are ignoring the high end workstation market toe knee heel is there any chance they’ll switch to new apple chips across their desktop range all their desktops are due for a renewal and they’re bringing out a new version of macos could they have chips focused on power rather than efficient power use and an alternate version of macos to run on the new apple chips joel hruska probably not i wrote about this two years ago but nothing has changed since then httpwwwextremetechcomcomputingwhyapplewontdumpintelxforitsownarmchipsinmacbooksandthemacpro toe knee heel thanks for the pointer to your article a couple of thoughts two years on… – i’d have thought the world view of the importance of windows software compatibility has diminished significantly as many major applications now have ios arm versions i believe there have been very few new windows software applications developed outside the enterprise over the last few years – the comparison of i to a chips shows the big disparity of performance resulting in an inability to deliver chip unity from ios to macbook and mac pro however much of the market seems to have settled into the i slower chips without the restrictions of managing power consumption i wonder how close apple could get their chips to a competitive bips with specifically designed architecture maybe the reception of the macbook v has demonstrated less users require raw power – i’m sure there are some very clever hardware engineers at apple that would like to design and build their own chips for the complete stack and sometimes when the gauntlet is thrown down… ultimately the timing just seems tactically interesting for september apple has delayed releasing products across their entire macos range they are about to release a new version of macos which includes a new file system apfs so they’ve created the opportunity to develop deep compatibility and they’ve kept new versions of their os under wraps very well in recent years this september might just be interesting too… joel hruska the importance of windows compatibility isn’t trivial when you consider that none of the professional applications people use have equivalent mobile applications adobe may make a photo manipulation program for ios and they may even call it something like photoshop i haven’t checked but it’s not full photoshop you can’t run rendering software equivalents on arm either but the bigger issue here is that apple is highly unlikely to switch until and unless it can deliver an arm chip that is significantly faster than intel across the entire product stack consider the mac pro with its core intel cpu if apple wanted to it could upgrade the mac pro to an option that includes a  core cpu does apple have the expertise to build and design its own  core arm chip for its own server i doubt it not yet anyway historically apple switches when two things are true  it can gain performance for every product at every price level  the performance gain is much more than just  it wants  gains now they could always break from this pattern so i’m not presenting this as gospel — but i suspect they will not i think that if apple decides to make a switch entirely to arm it won’t do so any time in the near future prototyping and bringing up a  core chip is difficult that’s one reason why intel’s higherend multicore xeons lag about a year behind its consumer hardware it doesn’t make sense to move the mac mini and imac to arm if you still need x for the workstation line so i don’t think we’ll see an arm shift until apple can deliver advances on arm at every level and product type the shambolic skeptic apologist is right on egads man everything needs to be current – and that includes graphics – given we’re paying top dollar for macs freimacher apple users have to agree with apple’s decisions whether they like it or not so they rationalize reasons to keep a good image for their chosen brand with commodity pc hardware we have more choices i run linux and windows and build my own systems so i don’t have to kowtow to a single company if they’re lagging in innovation think about it what if an apple user wants a tablet with a good stylus that runs full desktop apps like photoshop the loyalist will say it’s a bad idea because apple hasn’t made one if they release one tomorrow it will suddenly be a good idea kojen ku give us a software that no one consumer can refuse to buy and thus upgrade the hardware borderguard so the author doesn’t know anything about graphics cards or storage shouldn’t be writing on this topic joel hruska the author is a hardware reviewer with  years of experience with everything from ray tracing equipment to d render stations to consumer gaming i cover storage too now if you’d like to disagree with something substantive or raise an actual issue or offer a viewpoint i can engage with please feel free  madhuvidya agnima “if your workloads depend on gpus and scale with graphics horsepower you aren’t using apple” in my industry film and television apple hardware is the norm across many aspects of production but the lack of hardware updates — especially for the mac pro — have people growing more and more tense by the day especially this month there has been a noticeable rise in frustration brian it isn’t a question of whether apple should have updated their hardware it’s the unqualified fact that apply hasn’t made any innovations in the same amount of time apple welcome to your decline danieleran “in  with the launch of the mac pro it looked like apple might embrace opencl gpgpu programming and offload” uh apple created opencl and metal now incorporates gpgpu effectively serving as a unified alternative to using opengl  opencl that bizarre line greatly detracts from an otherwise serviceable article joel hruska “uh apple created opencl” yes and they’ve shamefully neglected it httpwwwcgchannelcomopensourceddevscriticiseapplesopenclsupport opencl is only supported on apple hardware through  because apple writes its own drivers and bakes them into the os you can’t update them independently blender can’t run on the mx for this reason httpsdeveloperblenderorgt httpssupportapplecomenusht opencl  was ratified on november   opencl  was ratified on november   apple does not support ocl  on any of its hardware including hardware with amd graphics processors that are ocl  compatible under windows httpsstreamcomputingeublogapplemetalversusvulkanopencl as for why i say apple continues to ignore graphics my reasoning is simple it’s been six years since they updated opengl on macos and nearly three years since they updated opencl are you going to tell me that there were no improvements or meaningful additions they could’ve supported during that time even if they always intended to roll metal longterm i could believe that for ocl  since they were talking about it back in  it’s a lot harder to believe for ogl which they’d stopped updated long before kevinkillion apple offers three desktop choices a dinky little unimpressive looking cylinder with lousy expansion possibilities a lowerperformance machine that requires you to buy a monitor when what you want is just a computer or its smallest computer that combines the worst of both lower performance and poor expansion raoulo when they changed their name from apple computer they should have named themselves apple hedge fund they’re just cashing in until they slide into their eventual irrelevance iphone is like the apple ii it’s time will pass as well anders eklund lets not forget that apple’s opencl drivers are really
