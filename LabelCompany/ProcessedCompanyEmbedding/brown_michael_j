creations of the mind these creations can be generally broken down into the following categories   • patents protect inventions such as machines processes compositions of matter and certain designs • trademarks are brand identities such as product or service names logos or packaging • copyrights are artistic creations such as artwork writings film or music • trade secrets are nonpublic business information such as secret business formulas processes and methods the importance of intellectual property   most successful businesses in a wide variety of industries share a common trait they pay attention to their intellectual property assets including inventions brands and creative works  the intellectual property assets of successful businesses are what the businesses are known for  consumer product companies are known for their brand names  technology companies are known for their innovative and distinctive products  artists and entertainment companies are known for their creative works  each of these types of intellectual property otherwise known as patents trademarks and copyrights have their own characteristics and means of protection   attention to intellectual property is important failure to protect your intellectual property assets or to make sure that you are not violating the intellectual property assets of another can result in • loss of trademark rights • missed business opportunities • preemption in the market • infringement litigation • misappropriation of trade secrets • unfair competition • no attribution for your work • unnecessary expenses these are examples of the risks but a proper evaluation of your specific needs can determine whether any of these apply to your situation patents   patents protect inventions such as new products processes designs or compositions while any idea may be an invention in order for an invention to be patentable the invention must be new and not obvious in light of existing technology   a patent may be simply described as a government sponsored monopoly granting the right to exclude others from making using or selling an invention one common misconception about patents is that owning a patent does not give the patent owner the right to do anything with its invention as an exclusionary right a patent is more of an offensive tool than a defensive one   patents are national in protection and a patent in the us will not by itself provide any enforceable rights outside of the us  for protection outside of the us additional patent applications may be necessary   trademarks   trademarks are the names and logos used to identify the products andor services of a business a trademark serves the business by distinguishing the products andor services of the business from its competitors in the us trademark rights are acquired through use of the trademark however registration is recommended through federal or state registers outside of the us trademark rights are generally based upon registration   trademark rights are generally national in scope however there are regional trademark registrations such as the european community trademark and international trademark treaties that simplify registration in many countries and provide more cost effective solutions than separate national trademark filings   copyrights   creative works including writings artwork and music are automatically protected by copyright copyright provides the owner of the creative work with the exclusive right to control copying and creating new works based on the creative work otherwise known as derivative works registration is not required for copyright to exist but for us copyright owners a copyright registration with the us copyright office is a prerequisite for filing a law suit for infringement of copyright   trade secrets   certain information about a business may provide the business with an advantage over competitors provided that the information is not known to the competitors new technology often is kept confidential during development before patenting or even instead of patenting it is important that the business keep such technology and similar information confidential to maintain the competitive advantage usually through nondisclosure confidentiality and employment agreements   michael j brown law office llc    eisenhower parkway plaza i nd floor

formagnifying glasshelpful reviews r paul fulmer mdlee s rateddr fulmer was excellent he explained my proceedure in detail and made me feel very comfortable with my balloon sinuplasty surgery both before and afterward the surgery was non invasive and i was very comfortable throughout the whole proceedure which took a total of less than  minutes i was able to go back to work two days later and i highly recommend taking it easy for a couple of days to let the healing process start before over extending yourself the follow up appointments mainly cleared some small scabs that form and once those are removed i was able to breath better than i have ever been able to the first two weeks required four nasal rinses a day but once i got used to the routine it was second nature dr fulmer is a true professional and i highly recommend anyone that is thinking about having this surgery to go to him for his knowledge and expertise lee sr paul fulmer mdcindy n ratedi came in for seasonal allergies

demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary

even includes the occasional classical selection which is inevitable as he is a classically trained artist in the traditional sense pandolfis dexterity at the keyboard is highly polished yet one hardly notices one does notice his gorgeous tone which seemingly knows no depth his pianissimo playing which i can tell you reaches all the way to the back of the hall his massive fortissimos which always leave the impression that he has more to give his melting legato touch which makes the piano sound like anything but a percussive instrument and his seemingly limitless imagination once youve heard pandolfis presentation of a song it will be difficult for you to imagine it any other way partly this results from his own imagination he is able to listen to music and lyrics with such freshness even to the punctuation of lyrics that he understands what many of us pass over then he brings the resources of his technique his soundall his musical training and experienceto bear on the
