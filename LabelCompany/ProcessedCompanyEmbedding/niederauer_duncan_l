brings more than  years of experience to an already impressive paxos board consisting of former fdic chairman sheila c blair former us senator bill bradley former fasb chairman robert h herz and former chairman president and ceo of lotus development corporation jim manzi we all know of mr niederauer’s most recent exploits as the head of the nyse but before that he was a partner at goldman sachs where he worked from  to  he also cofounded the mountain top advisory group is a managing member of  capital the nonexecutive chairman of scenic advisement llc and sits on the boards of first republic bank realogy holdings and colgate university the simple sports analogy that comes to mind for this type of addition to the paxos team is when the denver broncos added peyton manning to its roster a few years ago i’m not sure if mr niederauer can throw a spiral like peyton but i know he can offer paxos some invaluable direction for their business one super bowl trophy another super bowl appearance and a league mvp certainly justify the denver broncos return on investment in peyton manning but the real similarity i see between the sports icon and the business mogul are their respective leadership skillsets as you can see from his resume above mr niederauer is a respected member of the world business community and paxos is very luck to have him on its board of

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime
