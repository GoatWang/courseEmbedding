sbproducts inc  home of the ar receiver spur sbproducts inc faqs safe act buy now photo gallery why the spur the receiver spur was invented to remove a specific firearm characteristic that can classify the firearm as an assault weapon while there are several characteristics that can classify a firearm as an assault weapon the receiver spur focuses on one key characteristic as detailed below click here to view the nysafe features presentation to see any images or descriptions to aid in diagnosing your firearm what is the spur the spur is a nylon  injection molded component that can be used to replace a protruding pistol grip on an ar rifle this durable piece will not absorb solvents or oils commonly found around firearms increasing the durability of the spur this component is

quantity you seek spur pricing email us dealer pricing available for dealers only call  understanding the safe act the nysafe act has impacted the landscape of firearm ownership this act in particular has greatly impacted the owners of ar rifles in nys and more specifically those looking to own an ar in the state of new york below are the criteria by which a firearm falls under the safe act if the sole criteria governing your firearm is the one below the stars then the receiver spur is a viable solution does the firearm have a folding or telescoping stock does the firearm have a protruding pistol grip does the firearm have a thumbhole stock does the firearm have a second handgrip or a protruding pistol grip that can be utilized by the nonshooting hand does the firearm have a bayonet mount does the firearm have a flash surpressor does the firearm have a muzzle break does the firearm have a grenade launcher does the firearm have a threaded barrel to accommodate flash surpression or muzzle breaks youve got questions weve got answers below are some of the most commonly asked questions associated with the receiver spur and where it stands with respect to the nys safe act does the receiver spur need to be permanently attached to an ar rifle no the receiver spur is a permanently modified part that cannot be turned into a pistol grip the nysafe act states that modifications to remove certain features is permissible will the spur fit the ar yes the spur does fit the ar and functions properly however aesthetically there is a small gap at the back of the spur where it meets the gun will it help with the safe act we have not received anything in writing from nys we are currently pressing the state for an official written determination we are confident the ar receiver spur does not run afoul of the law our attorney assures us we have not misrepresented our product or what it accomplishes the ny safe act permits modifications to remove design characteristics that define a rifle as an assault weapon has nys ruled on the spur yet short answer is no nothing in writing from nys yet every lawful authority state and local we have conferred with has assured us the ar receiver spur does not run afoul of the law we are going to continue to press the state for a written determination i spent  years in law enforcement and i am confident this modification relieves the rifle from the assault weapon definition if the pistol grip is the sole characteristic have questions fire away  please enter all details correctly  message sent thanks for your enquiry about for more

love your brand by ilan mochari ilan mocharis debut novel zinsky the obscure fomite press  earned rave reviews from publishers weekly kirkus reviews and booklist bostons npr station named it one of  good reads for the summer he is a senior writer for inc magazine ilanmochari senior writer incilanmochari write a comment credit everett collection want customer loyalty be there when theyre scared and alone thats the primary finding of a recent study from the university of british columbias sauder school of business  in the study published in the journal of consumer research ubcs lea dunn and joandrea hoegg demonstrated that consumers experiencing fear while watching a film feel a greater affiliation with a present brand than those who watch films evoking happiness sadness or excitement why does this finding matter for one thing it runs counter to general industry marketing typically there are fewer product placements in horror films compared to other genres for another its a branding wakeup call to marketers in all categoriesnot just those whose products like coke can be around when a movie is playing marketers are afraid of fear their worries about negative associations outweigh their desire to tap into the massive market commanded by fearbased entertainment such as horror films or video games notes dunn in sciencedaily  but our study shows advertisers should consider offering up their brands as something to cling to in the dark when the knives come out and the blood starts to splatter i recently talked with dunn about the surprising and interesting findings heres our conversation  though your study focused on movies do you believe it would hold up in other scary solitary settings for example might a driver alone during a long scary rainy drive at night become attached to her vehicle her brand of tires her windshield wipers what we joandrea hoegg and i show in the paper is that the presence of the brand is enough to help people cope with the feeling of fear the next logical step is that fear outside of a controlled setting like a movie experience should have the same effect unlike your examples our studies focused on brands that couldnt be instrumental in helping the consumers deal with the fearful situation we wanted to see if brands that were simply present in the environment ie food during a movie experience might allow for consumers to cope with fear and enhance emotional attachment the theory in the paper is that when we are afraid we want to share that experience with others and when others are not present we can successfully share that experience with an available brand so i would like you speculate that if the lights were out and i was afraid the fact that the brand of flashlight was there with me during the experience might be enough for me to feel more emotionally attached even after the lights came back on however i cannot speak directly to this point given the nature of our studies how are your findings applicable say to nonconsumer products companies in general a fear element is not going to fit for all brands because of course for many brands it would not make sense to scare consumers but a broader point is that consumers can form relationships with brands in similar ways to how they form relationships with humans running with this concept a takeaway point could be that a brand is more than just the product it is attached to one of our studies found that consumers didnt need to touch or physically consume the product to show higher emotional brand attachment after a fear experience instead the brands could simply be present and consumers would still show higher attachment this study shows that there is potential for a brandbe it simply a logoregardless of whether it is a consumer product or a nonconsumer product to fulfill consumers needs thus if brands could find a way to get their logo into a consumers hands eg promotional items or on their radars eg new media forms such as advergames or social media options then they might be able to see enhanced emotional attachment through fear published on feb   another reason to get attached to tes® – collegesource inc
