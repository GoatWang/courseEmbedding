links mechanism of actionedit egalet has developed one of the world’s first erosion based pill that allows for the controlled release of drugs the unconventionally shaped pill is made up of an inner matrix which contains the active ingredient and an outer coating shell made up of specific polymers the matrix or inner portion of the pill contains the dispersed drug the matrix is designed to erode when it comes into contact with water but not until the desired point of release in order to avoid hydrolysis and the reduction of enzymatic activity the active substance is then released with a zero order release which ensures that a steady amount of the drug is released over time this minimizes fluctuations while maximizing the amount of time the drug remains within the therapeutic window the matrix is protected by the outer shell coating made of polymers similar to those used in plastic more specifically the shell is made up of a cellulose derivative with thermoplastic properties this derivative is basically insoluble in an aqueous solution the shell also contains a second cellulose derivative which is soluble in an aqueous solution a plasticizer which promotes plasticity and reduces brittleness and a filler which increases volume the outer shell protects the inner matrix making it an ideal system for chemically unstable substances those with low melting and boiling points and waterinsoluble compounds also this protective shell significantly increases the shelf life of the substance the shell composition allows for controlled release of the matrix in both the stomach and the intestines despite the varying ph agitation etc once ingested the shell is separated from the matrix through water diffusion polymer hydration disentanglement and dissolution and the matrix can then carry out its intended function by altering the composition of the shell and matrix many drug formulations and ways of release can be achieved the altering of the shape and surface area of the pill can also affect release times the pills are made with injection molding similar to plastic molding in order to complete the creation process in one fluid step they are the first company to manufacture pharmaceuticals using this technology injection molding is accurate easy to reproduce for manufacturing large quantities has a low cost of production and allows for simple technology transfer the process is actually quite simple first the cavity starts off empty then the piston moves forward creating the shape for the shell and the coating material is injected next the material hardens and the matrix material that contains the drug is injected while the piston is recedes finally the matrix hardens while the piston ejects the finished tablet the matrixedit egalet has perfected the formation of an amorphous state of the active ingredient an amorphous state requires the formation of a higher energy solid state form creating an amorphous form of dispersion is important in order to be able to use poorly watersoluble drugs as well as to improve oral bioavailability the current pill enables the control of this amorphous phase as well as the controlled release of the active substance from the coated matrix system the inner matrix has been designed for improved bioavailability for specific situations where an insoluble active substance is needed and to prevent abuse or misuse of the matrix the matrix composition is made up of the following  a mixture of a first polyethylene glycols andor polyethylene oxides and second polymers block copolymer of ethylene oxide andor propylene oxide that have plasticizing characteristics the melting points of the polymers are at the most  °c the combination of the polyethylene oxides and the blocking copolymer
