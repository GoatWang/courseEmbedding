appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early

kennedy by thomas c reeves illustrated  pp new york the free press  what are we to believe about john f kennedy was he the shining intellectual who in the words of arthur schlesinger jr gave his country back to its best self and transformed the american spirit or was he the selfindulgent womanizer the opportunist and scoundrel portrayed in so many recent exposes of the kennedys in a question of character thomas c reeves a professor of history at the university of wisconsin parkside and the author of biographies of president chester a arthur and senator joseph mccarthy comes down emphatically on the side of the iconoclasts mr reevess kennedy is a compulsive womanizer a liar a bully an amphetamine addict  a ruthless lazy corrupt selfindulgent hypocrite he was americas first successful television politician television magnified his surface attributes  his good looks warmth and humor  and helped turn him into a national hero leading the country on to a new frontier the kennedy in a question of character was like his father joseph kennedy a man of bad character he was the product of an emotionally impoverished childhood he suffered from an inability to love or express feelings he grew up hostile    toward marriage and the family women were at best sex objects chasing women became a career his navy heroics on pt  during world war ii were the invention of publicists he was not a particularly good commander and mr reeves says his poor judgment contributed to the sinking of his boat and the death of two crewmen though kennedy emphatically denied it throughout his life his father played the decisive part in pushing him into politics he was a lazy congressman mr reeves says who spent much of his time seducing secretaries and airline hostesses his father had to manage his finances he surrounded himself with obsequious friends whom he bullied and he showed no interest in any political issue when he ran for the senate in  his only concern was winning jack like his father and his brother  robert   was without any guiding intellectual philosophical or moral vision in his pursuit of office politics like life was about winning and little else spurred by his fathers ambition to run for president he pulled out all the stops to win his successful campaign in  mr reeves writes involved the cynical manipulation of issues unrestrained spending vote fraud the mafia ceaseless adultery and dishonesty about kennedys intellectual achievements and physical condition mr reevess portrait of kennedy as president is no less scathing in the white house his bad character played a major part in making him a poor president he had little interest in domestic affairs made a number of bad judicial appointments demonstrated cautious opportunism in dealing with pressing civil rights questions and fouled up royally in dealing with the bay of pigs invasion and escalating american involvement in vietnam whatever his superficial attributes as president kennedy was pragmatic to the point of amorality his sole standard seemed to be political expediency    jacks character    lacked a moral center a reference point that went beyond selfaggrandizement mr reeves believes that if kennedy had lived and won a second term his lechery and dealings with mafia figures might have become public knowledge and led to his impeachment what are we to make of mr reevess case against kennedy does he add anything to the revisionist attack on his character not in the least his allegations are almost exclusively drawn from books and articles that have appeared in the last  years nothing here can be described as research in primary sources for all mr reeves knows the allegations about kennedys unethical behavior are largely or partly fiction it is of course possible that much of what mr reeves records is true there has been so much written about kennedys womanizing for example that there seems more here than just the imaginings of scandalmongers eager for a best seller but mr reeves does nothing to help us discriminate between fact and fiction at best his book is a summing up of revisionist assertions about kennedys character flaws and do we learn anything about kennedys white house term from mr reeves not that i can detect the  pages he devotes to the presidency in this page book break no new ground but then his research  aside from some oral histories and an occasional interview  was too limited to expand our knowledge with some justification he complains about the limits on what researchers can get at in the kennedy records but mr reeves would do well to read irving bernsteins recent book promises kept to see what a skillful historian can achieve by studying the available manuscripts in the john f kennedy library in fairness to mr reeves one has to acknowledge that his purpose was less to find new materials than to say something about the impact of character on political leadership good character he writes is an essential framework for the complex mixture of qualities that make an outstanding president and a model leader for a democratic people and the real kennedy  as opposed to the celebrated hero espoused by the kennedy family the media and the camelot school  lacked greatness in large part because he lacked the qualities inherent in good character mr reevess point  that a presidents behavior can demean the presidency and lower respect for the nations highest office  is well taken nor can one justify presidential transgressions by acknowledging that american politics has not been notable for its saints still a good character has never guaranteed presidential greatness just as a flawed character has not precluded it were it otherwise herbert hoover and jimmy carter would stand in the front rank of american presidents and lyndon johnsons domestic achievements would be impossible to explain indeed even mr reeves admits that success in resolving the cuban missile crisis is ultimately attributable to  kennedys  leadership his behavior revealed a deeper concern for the nation and the world than many who knew him well might have suspected mr reeves believes that a growing maturity made the difference in kennedys achievement perhaps but it seems more convincing to believe that his better side was there all along and that mr reevess portrait is too fixed on kennedys failings to give us the full man since mr reevess book advances our understanding of neither kennedy as a man and as president nor the role of character in public affairs it will do little more than give satisfaction to kennedy haters drawing robert dallek is a professor of history at the university of california los angeles his book lone star rising lyndon johnson and his times  will be published in
