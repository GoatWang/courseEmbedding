shares by the selling shareholders we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of common shares by us in this offering for general corporate purposes including without limitation for the potential future refinancing if any of our issued and outstanding preference shares the financial services industry and each of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we face strong competition in gathering deposits making loans and obtaining client assets for management we compete both domestically and internationally with globally oriented asset managers retail and commercial banks investment banking firms brokerage firms and other investment service firms due to the trend toward consolidation in the global financial services industry our larger competitors tend to have broader ranges of product and service offerings increased access to capital and greater efficiency larger financial institutions also have greater ability to leverage increasing regulatory requirements and investment in expensive technology platforms we also face competition from nonbanking financial institutions these institutions have the ability to offer services previously limited to commercial banks in addition nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures the bermuda banking segment currently consists of four licensed banks and one licensed deposittaking institution including one large global bank and four domestic institutions including bermuda commercial bank

domestic and international clients there are also five nonretail category a banks and  limited service category b banks including cayman national and subsidiaries of international banks such as rbc in certain interest rate environments additional significant competition for deposits may be expected to arise from corporate and government debt securities and money market mutual funds in our wealth management business line we face competition from local competitors as well as much larger financial institutions including financial institutions that are not based in the markets in which we operate revenues from the trust and wealth management business depend in large part on the level of assets under management and larger international banks may have higher levels of assets under management in our trust business line we face competition primarily from other specialized trust service providers there are approximately  trust companies in the main international financial centers and many of our competitors in this sector offer fund administration and corporate services work alongside private client fiduciary services competition for deposits is also affected by the ease with which customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another our cost of funds fluctuates with market interest rates and may be affected by higher rates being offered by other financial institutions our management believes that our most direct competition for deposits comes from international and domestic financial services firms that target the same customers as the bank company
