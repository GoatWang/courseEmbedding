citigroup and ceo institutional clients group john gerspach  cfo analysts erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch steve chubak  nomura securities erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch good morning everybody i am erika najarian head of the banks research team here at bank of america and welcome to day two of our banking  financial services conference up next is a presentation you all were telling you were widely anticipating and we are pleased to have citigroup with us this morning we have copresident and ceo of the institutional clients group james forese consisting of its banking in markets and security services businesses citis icg business is among the premier franchises in the industry and according to the latest coalition data citigroup is tied for number one market share globally in fic markets jamie first joined the firm out of princeton as part of the securities trading group at salomon brothers in  and since them he has held various management positions throughout the markets divisions and was promoted to his current role in january  also with us today is cfo john gerspach and with that i’ll hand it over to jamie jamie forese thank you erika and thank all of you for joining us this morning there are a number of things that id like to share today about our institutional franchise and i want to start with the overarching goal that weve set for our business and that is very simply to earn an attractive rate of return by offering a targeted set of clients a full array of products around the globe in an integrated cost effective and responsible manner our strategy starts with our target clients the worlds largest multinational corporations financial institutions public sector entities and investors who truly value our global capabilities our goal is to deepen these existing relationships serving our clients with more products in more markets as they grow and transact around the world and importantly we want to do so in a cost effective and responsible manner that is how we believe we can create attractive sustainable rates of return for our shareholders today i will cover a few topics including an overview of our institutional franchise how we are growing and diversifying our business our productivity initiatives and finally our current returns and what is likely to drive these for us in the industry going forward starting with an overview over the last  months icg was a significant contributor to citicorp results generating over  billion in revenues nearly  billion in net income for return on assets of  basis points and a  return on allocated tangible common equity we operate the largest proprietary closed loop payment network in the world with direct connectivity to the banking systems in  countries and territories around the world we have trading desks in  countries and clearing and custody capability in approximately  and we facilitate around  trillion of transaction flows on a daily basis our business today reflects an ongoing transformation that began several years ago in  in the wake of the financial crisis we began to reshape our franchise for the evolving landscape we made key hires in select businesses including investment banking where we believe we could build competitive advantage we made important investments in our technology infrastructure and we also adapted to shifting regulatory demands by exiting nonvolcker compliant activities and scaling back businesses that we are disproportionately affected by basel iii rules we then moved to integrate the franchise better aligning our organization to serve our target clients in an efficient manner we started by sharpening our client focus rationalizing our client base to focus on a targeted set of multinational corporations and investors we eliminated layers of management and fully integrated operations and technology into the business empowering our leaders to serve clients more effectively across the business lines these actions enabled us to grow our wallet share with our target clients diversifying our revenue base while coming to market more effectively today our focus is on execution we must continue to deepen our relationships with our target clients continuing to grow wallet share with a focus on overall client profitability and returns we continue to streamline and better integrate our businesses and we will continue to adapt to the demands of the evolving regulatory environment citis global network is a core strength and a one that is becoming all but impossible for our peers to replicate in todays economic and regulatory environment in many ways where we do business today is function of how our client’s geographic presence and banking needs have evolved over the past several decades we entered many of the markets on this slide by leading or following our developed market clients into faster growing regions of the world and today a large part of our business is serving their local subsidiaries with cash management foreign exchange and other daytoday operating needs but a growing part of our business is serving large multinationals who are domiciled in the emerging markets helping these rising global competitors as they expand beyond their local markets facilitating these large and growing international flows is a unique opportunity for citi we offer our corporate and investor clients an integrated product suite from recurring transactional support to more episodic services like debt and equity capital raising and ma advisory our global payments network is the backbone of our franchise from which we provide adjacent products such as trade finance foreign exchange and interest rate and commodities hedging these operating relationships provide the foundation for additional underwriting and advisory businesses and they also contribute to our significant scale and expertise in secondary markets in fixed income we benefit from a large and historically stable corporate business in local markets rates and currencies and in equities were leveraging our historical strength in corporate equity derivatives to make greater inroads with our target investor clients we view our relationships on an integrated basis with balance sheet intensive products like lending or reverse repo supporting our overall client profitability and returns we also serve ultrahigh net worth individuals through the icg as their sophisticated banking lending and investing needs are most similar to those of our institutional clients weve spent a lot of effort over the past few years on target client selection reducing our total number of clients by nearly half citis target client is a sophisticated multinational corporation public sector entity financial institution or global investor with a significant wallet for wholesale financial products and services weve identified approximately  clients that were well positioned to serve that meet this definition and were tailoring our coverage model to focus on these clients ensuring that they get priority access to our people our ideas and our capital in  these target clients generated  of our client revenues and accounted for  of our corporate credit exposure theres very good alignment there our business is diversified by geography product and client type in the developed markets our business is fairly balanced between markets and banking including tts with a higher concentration of client revenues coming from investors as you might expect and in the emerging markets you can see that nearly twothirds of our client revenues are generated with corporate clients these corporate revenues tend to be more stable and recurring in nature treasury and trade solutions generates a large share of our revenues at over a third of our em business and these operating relationships drive a significant amount of local banking and foreign exchange activity the em business is also highly efficient accounting for just over  of our revenues but more than half of our pretax profit in icg the recent operating environment has been challenging as you all know but against this backdrop we have significantly reshaped our franchise in  we generated over  of our revenues in fixed income and overall markets and security services activities represented over half of our business over the past two years weve driven targeted growth in less asset and capital intensive areas including investment banking equities and the private bank while continuing to grow volumes in treasury and trade services as a result our business today is more diversified with a better balance between banking and markets we have gained share with our target clients across many products and regions and weve maintained significant scale and fixed income positioning us to continue to consolidate volumes as some of our peers retrench at the same time weve removed roughly  billion from our annual cost base since  even as we faced a higher regulatory and compliance burden now id like to talk a little bit about how weve been growing our franchise first as i mentioned were focusing on deepening our relationships with existing clients growing with them as they operate around the world were better aligning our organization and reducing complexity to deliver the firm to these clients more efficiently we are consciously diversifying our business mix by growing lower capital intensity businesses to compliment our leading fixed income franchise and importantly were serving our clients from a position of strength being well above our current capital and liquidity requirements we will continue to optimize our business as the regulatory rules evolve but fundamentally we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our target clients let me share some more detail on our businesses treasury and trade solutions is one of our largest businesses and the backbone of our franchise tts connects our clients to the banking systems in  countries and territories around the world it is also a tremendous source of high quality deposits and although these deposits are under earning in this low rate environment weve been able to hold revenues stable in cash management weve absorbed most of the spread headwinds with growth in volumes and fees deposits have continued to grow and while spreads have declined in recent years were starting to see the deposit spread bottomout as you can see on the lower left in trade financing however spreads have continued to contract this year while we remain a leading provider of trade finance we have shifted our strategy to sell more of our originations allowing us to still serve our clients while contracting our balance sheet somewhat and preserving our returns we believe the investments we have made in new client mandates and higher volumes position us well to benefit from an increase in shortterm interest rates and improved spreads turning to investment banking as i described earlier beginning in  we made significant investments to transform our business we cannot just lead with our balance sheet our goal is to be a trusted advisor to the world’s largest and most global firms and we know this requires longterm investments in the right people and the right client relationships we are beginning to see those investments take hold investment banking revenues are up  annually since  with strong growth in ma and equity underwriting complimenting our historical position of strength in debt underwriting we have gained wallet share in all three major products with an overall industry share of over  yeartodate and a target client wallet share exceeding  and of course we are benefiting from very strong market volumes this year our private bank has also been a consistent source of growth up  annually since  our business targets ultrahigh net worth individuals around the world with at least  million of household net worth and at least  million of investible assets it’s at the very highend of the private banking target market these clients require a similar level of expertise as our corporate and investor clients ranging from traditional banking to tailored investment strategies and advisory services we deliver the full capabilities of our institutional franchise to our private bank clients and this integrated approach has driven steady growth in business volumes and assets under management over the past three years we have seen revenue growth across all private bank products and we continue to hire selectively to build out this franchise we have also grown our equities business while our progress has not been in a straightline our revenues are up  annually since  driven by momentum in equity derivatives and prime finance these revenues have doubled in these two products since  offsetting industrywide pressure on cash equities and i believe we can even do better at the same time we have been focused on improving our efficiency in equities streamlining the organization from fronttoback while being mindful of the impact on our clients as a result we have grown revenues while reducing our expenses and headcount nearly doubling the revenues per senior head senior employee over the past few years of course our largest single business is fixed income over the past four years industry fixed income revenues are down roughly  driven by regulatory changes and a challenging macroeconomic environment but we have been able to cushion this impact by consolidating wallet share up  basis points since  to an estimated  share of the market we believe our scale and unique franchise are serving us well as smaller peers have retrenched a significant portion of our activity stems from leveraging our corporate operating relationships in banking and therefore our fixed income franchise boasts a much greater proportion of corporate client revenue these corporate revenues have been more stable overtime and are also highly dependable as we are managing these clients operating accounts across more countries and regions than any peer can offer on average corporate end users generated a third of fixed income client revenues with the reminder balance across traditional asset managers hedge funds and financial institutions our regional revenue distribution reflects our global footprint with low single region accounting from more than about a third of fixed income revenues on the left side of this slide we show a breakdown of our fixed income revenues by product based on averages over the past three years rates and currencies comprised just over half of our revenues with the reminder spread across credit securitized products municipals and a growing contribution from commodities while the size of our business in spread products and g rates in currencies is roughly in line with our peers in the market we are unique in size and breadth of our local markets rates and currencies franchise our local markets business is the most significant example of fixed income activity stemming largely from corporate operating relationships these revenues have shown a stable base line of roughly  billion annually over the years even through significant global events as you can see on the right we were able to capitalize on the significant investor flows brought about by qe in  and early  but over the past year and a half these revenues have stabilized again in the range of about a  billion per quarter now rest assured our strategic priorities are not only about revenue growth our goal is also to continue to improve the efficiency of our franchise we have demonstrated expense discipline by reducing our annual expenses in icg by  billion since  even as weve absorbed higher regulatory and compliance cost as well as higher legal and repositioning charges both our efficiency ratio at  and our comp ratio at  compare favorably to peers though there is still work to be done for icg to achieve our  target efficiency ratio of  to  the reduction in expenses has not just come from calling staff and cutting comp but as i just discussed from streamlining and better allocating our resources to our clients weve simplified our organization removing the management layers in securities and banking and transaction services to operate in a more integrated manner weve rationalized our coverage efforts weve reduced capacity in certain areas and we are focused on improving our back and middle office efficiency as well as a result we have reduced our core expense base by more than  billion since  we have spent nearly  million on repositioning initiatives over the last two years which have yielded approximately  billion of annual savings efficiency savings above and beyond those tied directly to repositioning have yielded an additional  million in net efficiencies however these savings have been partially offset by roughly  million of incremental regulatory and compliance costs mostly related to risk management aml enhanced capital planning and technology investments as weve said before we expect these regulatory and compliance cost pressures to continue let me now review our returns and outlook for the industry over the past  months icg generated return on assets of  basis points relative to citigroup and at roughly  basis points and a groupwide target of  to  by  our return on tangible common equity was nearly  we generated an attractive rate of return on allocated tangible common equity even as some of our businesses faced strong cyclical headwinds and we incurred higher than normal repositioning charges there continues to be a lot of debate on whether the drivers for returns in our industry are cyclical versus secular and what the longterm return profile looks like for the industry ours is an industry that always seems to be in transition and never more so than today with macroeconomic uncertainty shifts in monetary policy and new capital and regulatory requirements all hitting us at once but responding to change is nothing new in this industry and as i have seen several times in my nearly  year career the industry structure will adjust and adapt and will comply with the new regulatory environment and through the cycle this is an industry that should be able to earn a midteens roe with a low doubledigit cost of equity as i look at the world today i see many potential tailwinds both cyclical and circular as weve seen in prior cycles markets today are going through a transition period as the world responds to the prospect of a shifting rate curve and uneven global growth we also saw extraordinarily low volatility across asset classes for periods of this year we do not see this as a structural issue and in fact we have started to see volatility revert back to higher levels in some areas which was positive for our results in the third quarter beyond these cyclical factors there are potential secular tailwinds as well while capital and compliance requirements have increased on our business this also increases the barriers to entry for others without the right scale and infrastructure to operate on a global basis and the longerterm drivers of activity remain intact as well from the continued migration of corporate bank lending to capital markets to the ongoing growth and maturity of global securities markets we believe many secular headwinds have already been absorbed from higher capital requirements to the limits on proprietary activity under volcker of course uncertainties remain including the macroeconomic environment and the prospect of additional capital surcharges that could put pressure on industry returns but we believe the main headwinds we are facing today are more cyclical in nature while ive covered many topics here today i want to leave you with a few key thoughts first our institutional franchise is unique in its global reach and diversification which we believe positions us well to serve our target clients our focus is on continuing to deepen our existing relationships with these clients as they grow and transact around the world and we are streamlining our business to deliver the firm in a cost effective manner while we continue to optimize to the evolving regulatory environment we believe we can deliver attractive sustainable returns to our shareholders overtime and with that i thank you and john and i will be very happy to address your questions thank you erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch thanks jamie so maybe before we open up for qa wed ask a polling question here this is more for the stock rather than just for your business jamie so well start same question john as we saw last year despite progress in winding down the income drag from holdings citi continues to trade below tangible book what do you think is the ultimate catalyst for the stock to rerate one receiving a nonobjection to its  ccar request to return capital two more aggressively streamlining its footprint or further business or country exits three more aggressive reduction of legal and repositioning charges or four more aggressive operating cost cutting within citicorp seven seconds left on the clock jamie forese thank you we have a lot of time erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch survey says jamie forese not a big surprise erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch not a big surprise jamie forese not a big surprise erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch for those of you on the webcast  say that receiving a nonobjection the  ccar request to return capital you think is a primary catalyst so maybe before we ask some questions jamie on your business and i actually thought that slide on cyclical versus secular headwinds was quite excellent weve heard feedback from banks during this conference that the fed is giving more detailed instructions and to four banks with regards to expectations for qualitative for their ccar round and to the extent you can comment on that i was wondering if you could shed some light perhaps on this process how this process is going so far jaime forese well i think the process is going well and i do agree that the fed is giving more guidelines im not going to say instructions but clearly the guidelines are much more apparent even to the extent that when weve gotten the ccar scenarios need and the ccar letter this year that was actually a fairly good summary i think for the first time of what the fed is actually looking at as far as making the qualitative assessments so that was the first time leading into the test that we actually understood what the fed is looking for and during the course of certainly in the past six months weve had a lot of good dialog not just with the fed in washington or the fed in new york but importantly with the leaders of the horizontal teams and the fed breaks down the ccar review into about  or  horizontal teams and its really those team leaders that youre dealing with and are really setting the standards then as far as assessing where you rate with your individual processes so this has been very helpful erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch so jamie maybe going back to your presentation when you look at all of the different secular headwinds that you sighted for your business it seems like citi is relatively well positioned in that obviously there is not a way to replicate a money center global franchise at this point additionally if you look at where you are in cet where you are on slr and the benefit of your deposit franchise to nsfr it seems like even if you don’t want to leave with your balance sheet youre well positioned to continue to be in the balance sheet intensive businesses i guess as you think about more how the landscape will shakeout because of regulation over the next three years do you think that we still are in a early innings of business exits or footprint exits for some of your global peers and how does citi position in this new post regulatory world jaime forese well i do think we are well positioned the industry has been adjusting to new regulatory rules and higher capital requirements for some number of years and we actually feel that what we and maybe to a slightly lesser degree the global industry have made most of the adjustments so far there are still adjustments that have to be made but we are in the later innings of the adjustments to the secular pressures the american banks as a group are probably further ahead than the european banks they are still under some capital pressures right now but weve had a look at these rules roughly speaking now for some time and if we havent been making adjustments we wouldve been asleep so we feel pretty good about that i think that the business exits are going to continue but probably slow the pace will probably slow i think weve seen most of the firms that are going to take action on shrinking their fixed income franchises already do that or begin that that process is well underway at a number of banks and i think most banks now at least their next response will be to try to improve the operating performance of businesses rather than exit them i think theyre close enough to probably for them for profitability to try to make them work rather than to simply exit i think one of the challenges that we have across the industry is that the fixed cost of doing business in a large global bank have gone up weve talked about the increase in regulatory and compliance costs for the large banks around the world weve got to try  the fewer businesses youre in the more than burden falls that expense burden falls to a smaller set of businesses so if you can sustain scale youre better off of course if you can sustain is a key phrase there but that i think is what people are going to try to do here as best they can erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch and there are certain products that are clearly less profitable on a standalone basis like repo while repo has never been not profitable as a standalone product anyway any thoughts of whether or not how the industry is thinking about potentially repricing certain products or is it more like to your point on a presentation more aggressive in taking market share sorry wallet share jaime forese i think there will be a combination of reactions what’s happened there a little bit the products like when we repo has not been an attractive business secured lending has been a good return on risk capital it’s not a particularly good return on crude measures of capital so with the increase in the supplementary leverage ratio for the banks that has put pressure on businesses that are poor returns raw leverage but good returns on a risk adjusted basis so that has put the focus on things like secured lending or providing revolving credit and alike i think the industry adjustments to that will likely be twofold one is there will be some movement to try to increase prices they try to charge more for going to lend on that basis and the capital required to support those activities has gone up we will try as an industry to try to put pricing increases into those products i think that will be one methodically evolving part of the business but i think the other will be a decline in the industry capacity of that i think you will see a shrinkage of secured financing available to clients a third reaction will be to better target that to clients that you think are important to develop a better relationships that you can help drive other parts of their wallet so i think there will be a pricing adjustment probably it will be gradual it won’t solve the entire problem there will be further capacity coming up because some of it’s already been happening and i do think you are going to see it what the remaining capacity more focused on certain client segments for each bank erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch great that might be a good time to open it for questions steve steve chubak  nomura securities thanks for the  i like the breakdown of the fic by product we haven’t seen that in a while i don’t think the question have is the local rates and currencies which is obviously always been a big part of citi’s fic business it looks like  i am just trying to get a better understanding of going forward at the fed and the uk raised rates we are existing qe we are probably going go into a rate tightening cycle historically that’s led to a stronger dollar maybe flows out of em back into dm how do you think that’s going to affect those revenues over the next year or two have we reached bottom do you think i mean you said there about  billion a quarter but the timeframe with what you should was fairly limited i am just trying to get a sense on how you think that will affect your fic revenue outlook in ’ and ’ since that is a big part of your business jaime forese when we try to model our fic revenues which is a much of a challenge for us and i think probably is for you we don’t see a tremendous correlation between the level of rates and our revenues what more correlated to is volumes and volatility and not the kind of disjointed volatility we saw back on october th but just daytoday volatility things moving throughout the course of the day where we see one investor thinking that the rate is too high and another investor thinking the rate is too low and we can match that that difference of opinion through our secondary trading so as long as there is active trading in markets and that’s not all one way the flows are all one way we think we will continue to have strong revenues in the em franchise our worry would be  is not that there is an adjustment to higher rates both in the us the uk and potentially throughout emerging markets our worry would be that there is just no activity whatsoever that you make just sudden jump to a new level and there is no trading activity along the way steve chubak  nomura securities and just one followup you are not slr  thats a little bit to the question that was asked earlier you are not slr constrained as much as some other banks so can you  since you said you were trying to grow fund brokerage anyway are you willing to accept like a much lower return on crude capital metrics on repo in order to get more business and do you think that strategy will work jaime forese only to a limited degree we are not capital constrained at the bank level but we evaluate all of our businesses in terms of the capital that they are consuming but we also want to take advantage we want let our shareholders take advantage of the fact that we have a portfolio of businesses some of which use a lot of capital on the slr basis some of which don’t some of which use a lot of capital on a rwa basis some of which don’t and the diversity across the portfolio should be something that we can help deliver better returns for but we still look at the returns in every business so we are not going to grow our balance sheet in prime finance or reverse repo boundlessly because we have capacity under the slr erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch i think we had a question in front unidentified analyst you have done a good job on the cost saving side over the last few years obviously some of that’s comp ration some of that is ftas but with the higher regulatory expenses now and with where you are with ftas and comp where do you get the extra efficiencies from in the next couple of years specifically i mean where do you think those opportunities are because it sort of looks hard jaime forese yes well it’s definitely going to get harder the more  and whenever you embark on an exercise to create more efficiencies the easiest decisions are at the beginning of that process and as you go through it approved it just gets harder harder and harder but we still have opportunities every issue we come in and look at the way we do business there is always ways to make if faster better cheaper i think we have some opportunities really to better systematize some of our processing some of our operations abilities this move of by moving ot into the business has given us a sharper focus on the front to back efficiencies of the business instead of thinking about them in segments the front office tries to run as efficiently as possible the middle office as efficiently as possible and the back office quite often the back office could be made more efficient with a change in the front office processing so if we can understand the process from front to back make a change at the front which has no bearing on the lives of anyone in the front office but a slight change here will make something much much easier to someone in the back office and make that more efficient thats where i think we will find some of our next series of improvements and we continue to look at other things as well we will continue to look at headcount reductions so there is things that  as our business mix changes too there are things that were generating good returns two years ago they aren’t generating those same returns there and so there is an opportunity again there for us to reposition resources out of that one area so that we can then redeploy some or all of them into other areas erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch further questions from the audience jamie you mentioned ib equities and private bank obviously where you’d like to be bigger where are you in your investment cycle with regards to electronic and equities jamie forese the investment in technology in equities in foreign exchange and the other fixed income segments is continuous i dont think you could ever say that we are done with it or that we are three quarters of the way through it because every year we see a whole new series of investments that we have to make to stay current to continue to serve clients to get more efficient and alike so i think we feel relatively good about the competitive nature of our equity execution technologies today and we feel that we have enough resources to keep them competitive in the marketplace but it never really ends its not like we could say we are done with it and now next year we wont have to spend anymore on it we are continuously spending on our technology to enhance those systems themselves those applications as well as to better automate existing operational processes erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch great any more questions from the audience over here unidentified analyst just a quick question on the trade finance your decision to sell an increasing portion of those loans whats driving that is it the capital charge on those particular loans are you seeing increasing risk in that line of business jamie forese no it’s really returns it is just very simple there is so much liquidity now out throughout the banking system that the demand for shortdated highquality assets like trade assets has increased tremendously so holding those assets on the balance sheet is just something that the return that we are earning on the roa on high quality assets has fallen so thats just put pressure on our return so we are looking at the portfolios we originate the trade assets we are looking to see if we cant sell profitably those trade assets to other banks earn a small margin by for the original origination activity that we did sell the asset we are left with no asset in the small profit margin so we are willing to sacrifice total revenue and to be more efficient with the use of the balance sheet thats really whats driving it as the dynamics in that market may change we may do just the opposite and opt to keep more of the loans on the balance sheet if we thought they were generating attractive yields erika najarian  bank of america merrill lynch great any more from the audience
