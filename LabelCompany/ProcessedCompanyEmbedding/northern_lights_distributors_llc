northern lights distributors was recently quoted in the fund operations article “understanding the nuances of omnibus accounts” the article discusses the rise of omnibus accounts in the mutual fund industry and how that has spurred a new operational role one that focuses on intermediary relationships and fee structures in an intensely regulated environment “managers are asking how intermediaries

an area of growing focus in the mutual fund industry as firms move away from the idea that continuity simply means staying in business during an outage and instead move toward the concept of business resiliency “business continuity several years ago was about location—it was regarding physical books and records and the ability to operate the organization and its physical infrastructure” alma piscitello head of strategic relationships at northern lights said “fast forward and it is now looked at through a technology and peoplepower perspective it’s about information security and this
