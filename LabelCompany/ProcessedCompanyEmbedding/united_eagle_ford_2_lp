technologies and design are on the waythe bakken and eagle ford improvements are nothing short of spectacular and the reason breakevens continue to head loweroil and gas received a bullish lift from the trump upset the drop in oil price since  has created difficulty for levered eps things could change trumps protectionist vision of us energy independence could provide relief reduced taxes refiner credits and decreased regulation are all possibilities this could provide a more level playing field if refiners are the focus the wtibrent differential could change us production would also increase depending on policy there are disagreements on its effect some believe this will push down the price of oil oil production increases should increase the world glut but we have a different vision protectionist policies may not decrease world oil prices because the biggest consumer would be selfsufficient we would still need to import heavy sour crude wti west texas intermediate would delever from brent because the customer base would be different as would be supply and demand trump believes he can get us refiners to switch to lighter grades of crude this would require a significant investment to make the conversion to larger volumes of wti this should be a positive for the us oil etf nysearcauso but theres a low ceiling to prices trumps economic vision has us refiners using more wti and canadian crude as feedstock depending on legislation we could see us oil prices increase and brent decrease wider differentials could be problematic we do not know how it will affect world oil markets if the price of wti increases it would be a negative for crack spreads this means refiners could have increased difficulty competing internationally without its number one consumer opec will be more ineffective difficulties policing production of members could become chaotic it would be every man for himself unconventional production continues to improve opinions differ as some believe there is limited upside they believe we have maxed out our ability to recover more oil in place petroleum engineers would disagree unconventional well design is in its infancy recent changes have been

more production per location more importantly we are seeing more production per foot this increase currently offsets approximately half of the production lost to decreased activity the bakken was the first major basin developed in the united states it was followed by the eagle ford and permian we are analyzing oil data to show the differences by basin it is possible these production increases are
