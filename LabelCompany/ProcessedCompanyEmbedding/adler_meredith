adler sellside rebuttal  billion reasons to remain shortnov   about herbalife ltd hlf matt stewart longshort equitysummarysellside analysts have served their clients woefully on herbalifebarclays analyst meredith adler is still bullish in spite of her obvious follythere are  billion reasons she is mistakenherbalife nysehlf investors suffered through another day of liquidation wednesday as the common stock sliced through the  level since monday afternoon roughly  billion in market capitalization has been clipped from the equity value as herbalifes largest shareholder mr icahn bears the brunt of this decline  million shares x    million in marktomarket losses this is on top of the losses from herbalifes week high in the interests of rounding lets call that  million  million is mr icahns residual exposure together with mr stiritz thats  billion shed from the highs source covertressblogspotcom mr stiritz is herbalifes largest personal shareholder assuming he still owns his shares his losses from the week high amount to roughly  million his residual exposure is  million or so if you are wondering what it might have felt like to be a herbalife long the past few days you neednt wonder anymore herbalifes selfdescribed extreme bull john hempton was kind enough to post the following comments to his twitter account easy to feel defeated here only saving grace  the position is so small now it matters less still i confess it hurts schadenfreude is not something to revel in still i would be lying if i didnt admit that mr hemptons pain is somewhat satisfying after all he has called me a racist publicly not to worry john i forgive you i just hope you have the good sense to liquidate the balance of your holdings while you still can i apply this sentiment to mr icahn and mr stiritz too it would be awful to see either of these two successful men ride the ramey express to oblivion theres a pivotal decision you might have to make now that herbalifes business fundamentals are deteriorating i would take the bid while you still can in the wake of the recent violent price action on hlf the question for herbalife investors now of course is what do i do now barclays analyst meredith adler published a new note to clients on tuesday with some advice on that front in this article i would like to rebut ms adlers arguments one by one here is what she said in her note to her barclays clients if she still has any left here are my responses meredith adler title doing the right thing can hurt hlf has been taking a variety of important steps to make involvement in its business less risky for a potential distributor matt stewart right off the bat ms adlers note begins with nonsense herbalife has done nothing to make it less risky for a potential distributor pursuing the business opportunity herbalife recruits victims into the bottom levels of a mature pyramid scheme that shows robust evidence of saturation in key markets around the world if anything there has never been a riskier time to join herbalife as a new business opportunity seeker finding new recruits is tougher than ever building a legitimate retail business is a pipe dream in many parts of the world retail profits are scarce being late to the game is not less risky no matter how you slice it meredith adler changes that have been contemplated for a long time and even tested in a few countries are being rolled out globally now and over the next several months these changes include limits in the size of a first order and new standards to qualify as a sales leader not surprisingly they are dampening volume and sales growth in the short run though to a greater extent than the company had anticipated yet management remains confident that these changes build a healthier and more sustainable business and evidence from test markets shows that retention of sales leaders is higher and their productivity improves matt stewart again more nonsense the idea that lowering the qualification levels would dampen growth is absurd economics  tells us that if you lower the price of something you are trying to stimulate demand not dampen it the  volume point first time purchase limits are a paper tiger distributors can simply reorder a week later if they want and can still qualify for supervisor in one month if they so choose this fake antidote to inventory loading has no teeth whatsoever as a policy and is just a ruse to distract regulators it should be obvious to any analyst that the lower qualification levels for supervisor are supposed to be an immediate progrowth initiative and not the opposite q why would anyone want to qualify for a  discount slower if they were actually retailing this is an absurd proposition the reason the volume point thresholds have been lowered has nothing to do with retailing and everything to do with keeping the mice chasing the cheese in the pay plan as a reminder ms adler this is the cheese source herbalifecom as to the retention of sales leaders q if you make it easier to qualify for sales leader would you expect to retain more or less of them this coming february who might the company be trying to impress with this data if you said me meredith adler you are starting to understand john desimone as for productivity improving herbalife sales leaders recruited less new members this year than they did last year this seems like the obvious metric to hone in upon as recruiting drives the entire business model on that basis productivity is down yoy not up eg mexican sales leaders recruited far less than one member each on average in the rd quarter as did recruiters in the usa does recruiting less than one obese customer per sales leader sound like the kind of result we might expect from a weightloss company that is changing peoples lives or is that a data point that supports the idea that we are trying our hardest to find new poor people to strive for supervisor meredith adler it is not exactly clear why these changes are being made so quickly but the negative publicity around hlfs business model probably provided a strong incentive to take action now matt stewart it is exactly clear why these changes are being made so quickly herbalifes pyramid scheme is stalling out around the world herbalife is pulling three specific levers to keep the recruiting juggernauts momentum adjusted sg  a as a percentage of revenue continues to climb indiscriminately as the company dumps soft dollars incentives etc into extravanganzas trips and such herbalife should show evidence of massive operating leverage instead it shows the opposite the lower supervisor qualification thresholds are designed to preempt sales leader attrition come february of next year you seem impressed the company is expanding into desperate places like vietnam and greenland this might be a clue that the return to growth might not happen any time soon meredith adler it is also true that training distributors about the changes is probably done more efficiently all at once rather than making numerous changes every year that need to be disseminated to established as well as new distributors what is left for each investor to decide is whether these changes will make herbalife less attractive to distributors given other direct selling opportunities or more cynically if business momentum has already slowed and the changes being discussed are merely excuses matt stewart the answer in bold is correct business momentum has already slowed and the changes being discussed are merely excuses meredith adler we take a more optimistic view and importantly see that after the recent price drop investors are paid to wait and see if growth starts to reaccelerate we are maintaining our overweight rating but lowering our price target to  based on a x pe multiple of our new currency adjusted fy eps of  as a reminder fx is markedly pressuring reported eps in q and fy given the strength of the dollar against many currencies matt stewart your price target is now x the current price of herbalife common even as you have revised it down once already from  to  x eps for a company that must replace its entire distributor base every  years is optimistic if not irrational if investors are paid to wait and see if growth starts to reaccelerate are they also being paid to wait and see if the ftc sec doj ny ag and illinois ag arrest the company for business opportunity fraud as for the currency headwinds why you would assume that these headwinds are other than temporary escapes me entirely i also note that you publish  case scenarios for investors to contemplate here they are meredith adler price nov usd  price target usd  why overweight hlf has shifted its business model from selling bulk orders sporadically to selling smaller ones more frequently this shift has driven significant growth and we expect this momentum to continue given the regulatory overhang presented by mr ackman however we are using only a x multiple on our currency adjusted fy eps of  matt stewart really is this true hasnt herbalife always offered the choice of upfront qualifications or baby steps to get to supervisor arent these changes really cosmetic tweaks v fundamental changes have you seen how club  works or how nutrition clubs work to extract smaller ones more frequently also did you notice how the company made no mention of nutrition clubs on its call also i am wondering how you define significant growth it strikes me that  guidance calls for no growth i note too that your model assumes tepid growth in  as well is it your argument that because i cannot qualify for supervisor in  day but must take as much as one week to do so that this is a sea change in the business model also isnt it likely that more supervisors will just lead to a more competitive pricing environment for product more competition for limited margins and more events of failure in an already saturated sales leader pool how is this good for business long term meredith adler upside case usd  if hlf can sustain its current momentum in the business our estimates could prove to be conservative if the stock returns to trading solely on fundamentals the multiple should expand materially our upside scenario is based on x our currency adjusted fy eps of  matt stewart i am not sure what you mean by current momentum herbalifes sequential growth is nonexistent as for multiple expansion but for the contracting multiple across the entire mlm space i might agree eg did you notice nuskins results today mlm is now squarely in the crosshairs of investors regulators and alike a market multiple appears way too optimistic for valid reasons churn meredith adler downside case usd  mr ackman has called hlf a pyramid scheme and is trying to convince regulators to open an investigation although an investigation would likely take years we believe the stock may be volatile in the interim downside is based on x our currency adjusted fy eps of  matt stewart say what i am amazed that an institution like barclays would allow you to publish a statement as nonsensical as this mr ackman is not trying to convince regulators to open an investigation he has already accomplished this result along with a roster of consumer advocates and elected officials q do analysts at barclays bother to read the news before they encourage investors to chase unicorns also why you assume an investigation would likely take years seems wholly unsupported by any sort of evidence eg fhtm was investigated over a period of less than two years before an injunction was issued and its pyramid scheme was arrested the sec has been investigating herbalife for over  quarters now the ftc joined the party in march many of these investigations culminate with restraining orders and asset freezes trust me i looked it up as for your notion that the downside is  already all evidence suggests that this argument is nonsense too eg wednesdays closing price is  even herbalife extreme bull john hempton is wise enough to acknowledge that the downside for this stock is  and not  as for the rest of your report i offer you the following thoughts repeatedly you state that management says this or management believes that q do you conduct any independent thinking beyond what management spoonfeeds you q what is it about this particular management team that would allow you to rely upon anything they tell you as credible information they have missed guidance two quarters in a row and are being investigated by the most important regulatory bodies we have in our republic it appears to me that your entire report is built on a foundation of sand namely the assumption that herbalife is de facto a legitimate enterprise your valuation work doesnt assign any probability to the idea that you are dead wrong how any fiduciary could argue that clients should commit capital to a security on that basis is wholly irresponsible herbalife common is a speculative security at best and yet you gloss over most of the obvious risks of permanent capital loss to investors who are long q what do i mean by this at todays price herbalife has an enterprise value of  billion if it lasts another year before being arrested permanently it might produce  million in free cash flow the value gap between these two numbers is  billion this sort of outcome would leave junior bondholders permanently impaired and equity holders wiped out altogether increasingly other rational analysts buyside investors and truly independent analysts are discounting this sort of binary scenario into the stock price meanwhile you seem to tell investors that they are being paid to wait so to argue dead against this absurd notion you present i offer you the following a nogrowth mlm with an ever churning base of distributors might deserve a multiple of x epsfcf or x sales lets call that  billion if regulators kill the company its a zero assigning reasonable probabilities to these outcomes gives us a midpoint valuation of  billion net of net debt thats  billion for the equity lets call this  per share i have no idea when and where buyside investors are going to stop liquidating herbalife common near term in my view however the stock should trade in the  range pending the results of the governments investigation this evening we are at the top end of that range dont be surprised to see more selling in the sessions ahead certainly market participants find the notion that herbalifes intrinsic value is anywhere near  thoroughly absurd reading the arguments in your report makes it easy to understand the reasons why barclays should be better than this report your clients deserve better and more thorough analysis de minimus you should get your facts correct before recommending capital allocation towards a security of any type your comments on the state of the governments involvement are just plain wrong to close herbalife is a global pyramid scheme that will be shut down by regulators the sooner the better when that happens your downside estimate of  will be exposed as an unfortunate
