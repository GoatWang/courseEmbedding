note that there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds if we are only able to sell less than  of the securities we are offering substantially all of the funds raised by this

estimate that we will require as much as  in addition to the   that we are seeking to raise through this prospectus in order to establish operations of a sufficient size and quality to ensure the competitiveness of our business and to generate significant revenues nevertheless if our potential to raise capital appears exhausted our management may decide to modify our business plan on a reduced scale and quality this might entail the use of used equipment a used or leased vehicle for transportation less marketing smaller facility parttime personnel reduction in consultants and ga expenses a decision by our management to implement our business plan on a reduced scale and quality may occur at any juncture during the early stage of our business development whether we have raised    or  of the proceeds that we will seeking to raise through this offering or any percentage of the additional  that we are seeking to raise in the opinion of our management the consequences of implementing our business plan on a reduced quality and scale will be a reduction in our capacity to provide services and generate revenue a critical decrease or deficiency in our working capital and an increased likelihood that our business will fail moreover even if our financing potential becomes exhausted before we are able to raise the funds that we are seeking to raise there is no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing a scaled down version of our business plan especially if we have not raised any of our disclosed funds to be raised hereunder other than the preparation of this
