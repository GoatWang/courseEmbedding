pm conservative dean allison conservative niagara west on mr speaker this past weekend i attended the canadian health food association east trade show in toronto where i had the pleasure of meeting the folks from herbs a great company from my riding located in the town of grimsby unfortunately their business and the whole industry of natural health products are about to get hit with additional regulations imposed unilaterally by health canada bureaucrats we are all a bit confused as to why this is happening there are already regulations in place that were introduced by the standing committee on health after meeting with hundreds of witnesses over a year review period the newly proposed changes will see many natural health products regulated using the same rules as drugs natural health products are not drugs therefore why regulate them the same way the result will simply be less freedom of choice for the consumer and reduced access to natural health products the current regulations have worked since they were put in place and imposing additional ones is unnecessary and counterproductive i strongly urge and ask health canada not to proceed with the new regulations of natural health products so businesses like herbs can continue its excellent work links  sharing copycopied share on twitter or facebook view on parliament’s site see context to find out what was said next dean allison on supply  openparliamentca mps bills debates committees about labs search menu search dean allison on supply in the house of commons on november th  see this statement in context permalink supplygovernment orders november th    pm conservative dean allison conservative niagara west—glanbrook on mr speaker i would like to once again reiterate my support for the intent of the motion as we move forward as a society and we find things that are harmful to us it is important to take the time to debate the issues to figure out what it is that we can do to make our food supply and those kinds of things safer it is with that intent that i support the notion that as a government we should be looking at ways to reduce trans fats in some of the food products where i have a bit of a challenge and where i see that the motion is a little vague on details is in terms of the implementation strategy even though i think that the motion makes some sense in terms of being able to discuss the awareness of trans fats and looking at ways we can reduce them we need to look at how exactly we are going to do that it is the details which sometimes cause us a challenge in terms of how that happens my colleague talked about saturated fats and trans fats the motion talks about looking at trying to eliminate processed trans fats it talks about how processed trans fats are harmful and more likely to cause heart disease than saturated fats we could go back to what happened in the s and s with the whole issue of saturated fats we ended up going with trans fats and here we are some  to  years later talking about this issue and once again looking for a very quick resolution finding the real answer to this problem of taking out trans fats is going to take some time it is not going to happen overnight there is going to be further research as colleagues on both sides have said that process is in place right now people are looking at alternative forms whether it be through canola or other fats however if we just rush from one thing to the next we may be in the same situation  years from now not having fully tested it and not having looked at ways to ensure that trans fats have been properly replaced with something more feasible not only do we need to identify those products but we need to make sure there is a sustainable supply the member on the other side talked about new york fries one of the companies that has been able to successfully do this the challenge with some of the larger companies is being able to find that sustainable supply for the kind of demand that they have across the border certainly new york fries is a smaller company that has been able to harness some of the smaller products that are available if we are going to really make this happen in a meaningful way we need to look at the long term effects and availability and make sure that we are able to harvest this product in canada it is important to realize that when we replace these trans fats we will have ended up just complicating the problem and not fixing it for a generation trans fatty acids are like saturated fatty acids or ldcs or bad cholesterol levels in the blood trans fatty acids unlike saturated fatty acids also reduce the blood levels of hdl or the good cholesterol further increasing the risk of coronary heart disease an opinion published by the scientific panel on dietetic products nutrition and allergies for the european food safety authority in september  concluded that at equivalent dietary levels the effects of trans fatty acids on heart health may be greater than that of saturated fatty acids however the current intakes of trans fatty acids are generally more than tenfold lower than those of saturated fatty acids whose intakes in many european countries exceeded the dietary recommendations the opinion also reports that the available evidence does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether tfas have an effect on the ldlc different to a mixture of saturated fatty acids on a gram per gram basis in the whole process of trans fats there is no evidence of a difference in the health impacts of an industrially produced trans fat and naturally occurring fats in addition according to the opinion published by the scientific panel on dietary products nutrition and allergies for the european food safety authority in september  there are no methods of analysis applicable to the wide range of foods that can be distinguished between tfas which are naturally present in foods ruminant products and those formed during the processing of fats oils and foods what i am saying is that there are natural fats that occur in things as well as the trans fats and one of the challenges is trying to distinguish between the two in order to effectively figure out how to reduce some of these things one of the first steps is to make sure that we are able to measure that members of the scientific panel of the heart and stroke foundation also expressed concerns about the exclusion of natural trans fats in legislation since there is no feasible method to detect the differences between natural and manmade fats some felt the legislation would lack credibility if it did not include natural trans fats that it would be unfair for some companies because it would create an uneven commercial playing field it is very important to highlight the need to be able to distinguish between the two i cannot emphasize this enough if we are going to look at changing what we are providing in our products we need to look at the whole supply i mentioned that before but i think it is critical we have talked about some other forums coming onside but we are not quite up to speed in terms of what we are able to transfer out at this point in time we need to be mindful that we are not just looking at one industry but we are looking at all our supply a whole range of suppliers needs to be in the loop as far as this goes i appreciate the intent of the motion in that it talks about a multistakeholder consultation process that will be very important as we move this forward members should understand that a huge number of stakeholders are involved whether they be in the health sector or people involved in the food process there are food service operators and food manufacturers who are working closely right now to develop these things some of the companies were mentioned earlier we talked about some food manufacturers and food service companies that have made progress in the transition to trans free products such as new york fries which says it has removed all the trans from its fries as well pizza pizza has removed trans fats from its pizza dough we need to be mindful that finding a suitable replacement for oils that contain trans fats is a significant challenge this is not something that can be done overnight also we need to understand that in some cases alternative oils also present health risks such as an increased polymerization of fat if the polyunsaturated oils are used for frying some replacement oils are only available in limited supply i think we touched on that earlier some tfa alternatives remain cost prohibitive while others cannot be easily substituted without changing the products their taste texture and shelf life we need to realize that it does take time to develop and test these new products in addition to ensuring the alternative products provide the same flavour texture taste and structure characteristics food companies and food service operators must be able to secure a reliable supply of the ingredient that is being substituted in conclusion we support the intent of the motion but we need to be very mindful of the consequences on the whole food chain links
