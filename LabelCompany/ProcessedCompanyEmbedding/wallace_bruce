master of the lost genre of the noble youthbymaudemacon july  format kindle editionverified purchasei have read a half dozen of hentys seventy or more books they are formula works that cast an admirable youth into the caldron of historical conflicts hentys purpose is to tell morally uplifting tales of perseverance and honor while teaching otherwise accurate history for the audience of young adultsthis book is the best i have read both of hentys work and of scotland under the hammer think kiplings book kim set in scotland where kim winds up a mighty warrior and then a wealthy lord be sure to read hentys work next to a computer where you can pop up maps of the various unfamiliar locals of the storythis book covers scotlands resistance to the reign of edward i of england from the scottish perspective edward i the greatest of the plantagenets the creator of the nation of england the hammer of scotland was not a nice personthe greatness of this edward is undeniable he created the empire that came to rule the world the cruelty of edward is beyond the imagining of most modern minds he really did hang wallace for a while then take the still living man down and have him disemboweled then cut into four pieces and sent to the four largest cities in scotland five pieces actually he kept the head and put it on a pike outside the gate of some castle a scottish nobles wife who aided in the crowning of bruce was then suspended alive in a cage over the gate of another castlefor years and that was standard treatment for resistance to edwards planshenty covers this history through the life of a young man who serves the fabulous wallace and the unwilling nationalist hero bruce and through it all as in all hentys books the young hero remains good of heart powerful of arm and loyal to all he loves how is that for a refreshing twist in historical fictionas historical fiction goesthis one is right up therecomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to

editionverified purchaseold need not mean boring think of hentys style as jane austen meets kipling this book chronicles not only the life and times of william braveheart wallace but also robert the bruce king of scotland as seen through the eyes of a fictional hero well researched the history buff will also enjoy this novel of derringdo of course henty wrote in the convention of his day but this only makes the book more quaint his love interest is present but gentlemanly written much as sir walter scott handled the lovers in ivanhoe it is slow going at first but once the main character sir archibald forbesis introduced the book comes alive i suggest one google a map of scotland to see exactly where all this takes place as the book well and truly covers a lot of years and territory

as inappropriate visy  stars out of  important discussions through an engaging story may   visy quality  value  meets expectations  my wife  oldest children    and i really enjoyed this audio drama our two youngest children    were too young to follow along we stopped at multiple points while listening to talk through things happening in the story our  year old boy is sensitive and asked us at various points to stop it because he didnt like to hear the fighting however we asked him to continue with us as we listened through it so that he could be part of the important topics and even better understand the pains and sacrifice of war by the end of the story our  yearold said he was glad to have listened to it with us i believe that  years old and older is probably the best ages for this story the story was occasionally hard to follow due to the poor quality of our vehicles speakers however we were able to track with the important parts of the story and relisten to particular lines that we felt were too important to miss a thought provoking story that provoked much discussion was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate muzzy  stars out of  in freedoms
