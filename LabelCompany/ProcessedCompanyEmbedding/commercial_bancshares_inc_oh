operations item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following review presents managements discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition of commercial bancshares inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries commercial savings bank and commercial financial and insurance agency ltd at march   compared to december   and the consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended march   compared to the same period in  the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes the corporation is designated as a financial holding company by the federal reserve bank of cleveland this status can help the corporation take advantage of changes in existing law made by the financial modernization act of  as a result of being a financial holding company the corporation may be able to engage in an expanded array of activities determined to be financial in nature this will help the corporation remain competitive in the future with other financial service providers in the markets in which the corporation does business there are more stringent capital requirements associated with being a financial holding company the corporation intends to maintain its categorization as a well capitalized bank as defined by regulatory capital requirements management believes there have been no changes with respect to its determinations regarding the corporations critical accounting policies as disclosed in the corporations annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   forwardlooking statements certain statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in general forwardlooking statements relate to a discussion of future financial results or projections future economic performance future operational plans and objectives and statements regarding the underlying assumptions of such statements although the corporations management believes that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements contained herein are reasonable any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements included herein will prove to be accurate various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the corporations forwardlooking statements factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which the corporation and its subsidiaries operate competition for the corporations customers from other providers of financial services deposit outflows or reduced demand for financial services and loan products government legislation regulation and changes in monetary and fiscal policies which changes from time to time and over which the corporation has no control changes in interest rates changes in prepayment speeds of loans or investment securities inflation material unforeseen changes in liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the corporations customers changes in the level of nonperforming assets and chargeoffs changes in the number of common shares outstanding the capability to successfully enter into a definitive agreement for and close anticipated transactions unexpected claims or litigation against the corporation expected insurance or other recoveries technological or operational difficulties the impact of new accounting pronouncements and changes in policies and practices that may be adopted by regulatory agencies acts of war or terrorism the ability of the parent company to receive dividends from its subsidiaries the impact of larger or similar financial institutions encountering difficulties which may adversely affect the banking industry or the corporation the corporation or its subsidiary banks ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate funding sources and liquidity and other risks or uncertainties detailed in the corporations filings with the securities and exchange commission all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the corporation  commercial bancshares inc managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry application of these principles requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility between reporting periods the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by thirdparty sources when available when thirdparty information is not available valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques the sec has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available allowance for loan losses the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses as of the end of each calendar quarter the level of the allowance is based upon managements evaluation of the loan portfolio past loan experience current asset quality trends known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect a borrowers ability to repay including the timing of future payments the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio economic conditions industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent factors this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change loans are charged off in whole or in part when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely a loan may be partially charged off after a confirming event has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement is unlikely the corporation deems loans impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement collection of all amounts due according to the contractual term means that both the interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement an impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan the impairment is recognized through the allowance loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral dependent impairment measurement is based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposal costs in assessing the adequacy of the allowance the corporation also considers the results of its ongoing internal and independent loan review processes the corporations loan review process assists in determining whether there are loans in the portfolio whose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio the corporations loan review process includes the judgment of management the input from independent loan reviewers and reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process the corporation incorporates loan review results in the determination of whether or not it is probable that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan  commercial bancshares inc managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the level of the allowance is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries of amounts previously charged off for additional information see allowance for loan losses under financial condition fair value estimates the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities of the corporation is impacted by the application of fair value measurements either directly or indirectly fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale in certain cases an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis such as investment securities classified as available for sale in other cases management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or whether a valuation reserve should be established the corporation estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices quoted market prices are used for fair value active markets are those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information with reasonably narrow bidask spreads and where quoted prices do not vary widely when the financial instruments are not actively traded other observable market inputs such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics may be used if available to determine fair value inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes price quotations that vary substantially among market participants or in which minimal information is released publicly when observable market prices do not exist the corporation estimates fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods the valuation methods may also consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns other factors such as model assumptions market dislocations and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value changes in these underlying factors assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded additional information regarding the corporations fair value measurements can be found in note  fair values and measurements of financial instruments overview the corporation generates a significant amount of its revenue cash flows and net income from interest income and net interest income the ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the corporation managing credit risk also has a significant influence on the operating results of the corporation results of operations are also affected by noninterest income such as service charges on deposit accounts and fees on other services income from lending activities and bankowned life insurance as well as noninterest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits occupancy furniture and equipment professional and other services and other expenses including income taxes economic conditions competition

commercial loan and consumer real estate loan portfolios respectively partially offset by declines in installment and home equity loan balances the corporations loan portfolio represents its largest and highest yielding assets the fundamental lending business of the corporation is based on understanding measuring and controlling the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio the corporations loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk credit risk entails both general risks which are inherent in the process of lending and risk specific to individual borrowers the corporations credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification which limits exposure to any single customer industry or collateral type typically each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit losses based on historical loss experience home mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience while loans secured by personal property such as auto loans are generally expected to experience more elevated credit losses credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions generally improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt service requirements improvements if any in operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic times declining economic conditions have an adverse effect on the operating results of commercial customers reducing their ability to meet debt service obligations the corporation believes the general economic outlook remains stable without any clear or substantive trends in employment rates real estate values or overall consumer or commercial confidence spending or investment  commercial bancshares inc managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to control and manage credit risk management has a credit process in place to ensure credit standards are maintained along with strong oversight and review procedures the primary purpose of loan underwriting is the evaluation of specific lending risks and involves the analysis of the borrowers ability to service the debt as well as the assessment of the value of the underlying collateral oversight and review procedures include the monitoring of portfolio credit quality early identification of potential problem credits and the aggressive management of problem credits executive management has implemented the following measures to proactively manage credit risk in the loan portfolios � reviewed all underwriting guidelines for various loan portfolios and have strengthened underwriting guidelines where needed � evaluated outside loan review parameters engaging the services of a wellestablished firm to continue with such loan review addressing not only specific loans but underwriting analysis documentation credit evaluation and risk identification � increased the frequency of internal reviews to monthly reviews of past due and delinquent loans to assess probable credit risks early in the delinquency process to minimize losses � aggressively seeks ownership and control when appropriate of real estate properties which would otherwise go through timeconsuming and costly foreclosure proceedings to effectively control the disposition of such collateral � aggressively obtaining updated financial information on commercial credits and performing analytical reviews to determine debt source capacities in business performance trends � engaged a wellestablished auditing firm to analyze the corporations loan loss reserve methodology and documentation the allowance for loan losses alll is established through a provision for loan losses charged to current earnings the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is based on managements continuing evaluation of the portfolio the related risk characteristics and the overall economic conditions affecting the portfolio this estimation is inherently subjective as it requires measures that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available the corporations methodology in determining the allowance for loan losses includes segmenting the loan portfolio into various components and applying various loss factors to estimate the amount of probable losses the largest segment of the loan portfolio is comprised of creditrated commercial loans comprising  of total loans as of march   creditrated commercial loans include commercial and industrial loans along with loans to commercial borrowers that are secured by real estate commercial property multifamily residential property  family residential property and construction and land for each loan within this segment a credit rating is assigned based on a review of specific risk factors including i historical and projected financial results of the borrower ii market conditions of the borrowers industry that may affect the borrowers future financial performance iii business experience of the borrowers management iv nature of the underlying collateral if any and v borrowers history of payment performance when assigning a credit rating to a loan management uses an internal ninelevel rating system in which a rating of one carries the lowest level of credit risk and is used for borrowers exhibiting the strongest financial condition loans rated one through five are deemed to be acceptable quality and are considered pass loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated six special mention loans with adverse classifications substandard or doubtful are rated seven and eight respectively a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower characterized by a welldefined weakness  commercial bancshares inc managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the outstanding amounts of creditrated commercial loans are aggregated by credit rating and management estimates the allowance for losses for each credit rating using loss factors based on historical loss experience and qualitative adjustments reflecting the current economic conditions and outlook for housing employment manufacturing and consumer spending the economic adjustments reflect the imprecision that is inherent in the estimates of probable loan losses and are intended to ensure adequacy of the overall allowance amount the loss factors assigned to each credit rating are adjusted based on managements judgment along with certain qualitative factors such as the trend and severity of problem loans that can cause the estimation of inherent losses to differ from historical experience any change to an individual credit rating may affect the amount of the related allowance the corporations internal review process results in the periodic review of assigned credit ratings to reflect changes in specific risk factors commercial lines of credit are generally issued with terms of one year and upon annual renewal a full review of the specific risk factors to assess the appropriateness of the assigned credit ratings furthermore loans classified as special mention substandard or doubtful are placed on an internal watch list and undergo a credit rating review on a quarterly basis special mention loans or monthly basis substandard and doubtful loans as part of the oversight and review process the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb estimated and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting  the requirement that a loss be accrued when it is probable that the loss has occurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated and  the requirement that losses if any be accrued when it is probable that the corporation will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loans contractual terms the corporations allowance for loan losses has two basic components a general reserve reflecting historical losses by loan category and loan classification as adjusted by several factors whose effects are not reflected in historical loss ratios and specific allowances for individually identified loans general reserves are based upon historical loss experience by portfolio segment measured and supplemented to address various risk characteristics of the corporations loan portfolio including � trends in delinquencies and other nonperforming loans � changes in the risk profile related to large loans in the portfolio � changes in the categories of loans comprising the loan portfolio � concentrations of loans to specific industry segments � changes in economic conditions on both a local and a national level � changes in the corporations credit administration and loan portfolio management processes � quality of the corporations credit risk identification process the portion of the reserve representing specific allowances is derived by accumulating the specific allowances established on individually impaired loans that have significant conditions or circumstances that indicate that a loss may be probable specific reserves are calculated on individually impaired loans and    may   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from
