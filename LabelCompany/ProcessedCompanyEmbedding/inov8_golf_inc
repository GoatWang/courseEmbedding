years of doing crossfit and these did not disappoint i got the blue which i would say is teal and neon pink ones and ive been getting a lot of compliments they arent shoes that i wear when we have to do more than a mile of straight running in because of the lack of arch support but they are great for lifting box jumps and double unders roclite  gtx® posted  reviewer terri from san francisco ca overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars wanted to love these given the styling and how much i like my crosstraining shoes from inov unfortunately the size is still too small and tongue isnt padded enough for a light hiking boot flite  posted  reviewer from overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars no way these are really wide width i dont know why they are marked that way bummer because they are really cute mudclaw  cl posted  reviewer heather h from oh overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars i just love these shoes i am a  year old woman and i walk anywhere from  miles per day the majority of my walks are along pasture fields on mowed paths these shoes are perfect for my trail walks especially when walking on dewcovered ground or after a rain flite  v posted  reviewer john from wa overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars ive worn the new balance minimus for about  years and this is my first pair of the inovs these shoes have the same great minimal feel i had in the minimus but the upper feels more secure and the rubber sole is much stronger so far theyve held up great through rope climbs long runs sled pulls and all the other hell ive put them through great shoes all train  posted  reviewer from ut overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars i often have problems finding shoes for my wide feet i bought these for cross fit and was reluctant because my other shoes were so comfortable that i did not want to have the discomfort of new shoes that i so often have i was pleasantly surprised that these felt like a well brokenin shoe from the moment i put them on they are perfect for all my workouts and i absolutely love them flite™  posted  reviewer from key west fl overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars bought for work  are extremely comfortable however if you are on your feet all day you will probably want a shoe with a bit more padding mudclaw  cl posted  reviewer from new york ny overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars fantastic grip in the mud and wet surfaces i was so impressed with the way that i could just plow thru those types of obstacles they feel so what rigid compared to normal running shoes but if your only doing a few miles of mud or obstacles this is a great shoe to invest in roclite  posted  reviewer chris from overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars these are some of my all time favorite shoes i have the gtx version as well and knew to get a half size larger than normal even with the half size up they feel a little short during the breakin period after breakin though they are comfortable as i could ever want they are some of the lightest weight shoes for volume ive ever owned yet they are just as supportive as i need the arches are neutral which is good for me with flat feet they have a deep cutout for the achilles which makes for great comfort and flexibility ive used them for daytoday while building a deck mountain biking playing chase with my dog and walking in the woods they are excellent in all situations the only improvement i can suggest is to make the front of the upper one set of eyelet loops higher i like them so much i wrote the company to beg them to never stop making them all train  posted  reviewer from overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars i bought these to replace my inov flite s that i wear for crossfit the s are light flexible give good traction i love them these s have soles that are stiff as slabs of wood the gray plastic side panels that the carry the laces are extra stiff and make getting the shoe on and off really difficult and uncomfortable once the shoe is on the shoes collar is too high and rubs my ankle bones to top it off i usually take a  but since my s are s that what i ordered but they are too small xtalon  posted  reviewer daisy meyers from seward alaska overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars im training for mt marathon and ordered several shoes to find the right one these had to become the right one because of my time frame and because that mountain is no joke i had a hard time breaking these in only because my right foot is slightly larger than my left running down that mountain through the rocky chute climbing down the cliffs waterfalls mud has been so much better with these than i had thought even if my right foot is a little not happy with me it took some getting used to running on pavement but that is part of the race so be it the best thing about these is their flexibility im training to go up the roots part and where some areas are tricky these have literally saved me trailtalon  posted  reviewer from overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars this is my second pair of inov trail talons wearing these shoes i run the steep trails of the pacific nw with great confidence the tt is lightweight provides good forefoot protection and is very breathable with little cushioning however these shoes are not comfortable on gravel or loose terrain i havent run further than  miles in these shoes so i cannot say how well they perform on longer runs all train  posted  reviewer ian from california overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars overall very disappointed with this shoe i was looking for a shoe that had a little more padding in the sole compared to regular crossfit shoes not the case basically the same thickness with a narrow toe box and heel which makes the shoes feel unstable i could easily see an ankle roll in the near future this shoe is definitely a precision fit not a standard fit cut all train  posted  reviewer heather from vt overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars purchased these for lifting hiit and bootcamp classes very pleased with the look and performance of the sneaker extremely lightweight good gripping sole for remaining sturdy while lifting good lateral support for hiit and bootcamp classes this is not a running sneaker limited padding which is why i give it a  on comfort im ok with it since the majority of my time is spent in the gym just dont expect to be able to cross train with it i have bunions and these sneakers accommodate because there is no seam on the side of the shoe i wear a size  and they seem pretty true to size and dont make my feet look huge love the color and style only complaint is that i have to lace the sneakers for a high instep and the laces are pretty long and need to be double knotted otherwise love the shoe flite  v posted  reviewer from overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars inov is an amazing brand they are all i buy the toe box gives a lot of splay room xtalon  posted  reviewer mikey from overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars i returned these before i wore them outside but my overall impressions were that these would be great shoes for mud sand dirt wet or dry leaves but not for sharp rocks or haphazard boulders since they have no protection on the sides at all just mesh also i found the toe cap very light and flimsy with very little protection in the front as well im looking for a good shoe for yosemite and these would simply not do overall the fit was spectacular if you are doing muddies spartans or obstacles courses these would be perfect anything slightly unpredictable or treacherous i would suggest look elsewhere flite  v posted  reviewer from seattle overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars the toebox is not really that wide but it would be acceptable if not for a worse issue the worst part is that the shoe curves in right where my big toe lives that bends it out of alignment which is not healthy fyi my big toe is my longest toe i tried the next larger size and there was way too much length and it was sloppy around my foot other than this critical fit problem i love inov sadly i cannot wear them flite  v posted  reviewer kimberly hanson from port clinton oh overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars this shoe fits but after running in it my toes hurt wondering if i can return even if ive worn them its like the toe box is too big and causes my toes to flex incorrectly all train  posted  reviewer becky from bethesda md overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars best footwear purchase ive made i was looking for a shoe to mimic barefoot training to enhance mindmuscle connection and have better contact with the ground these do exactly that ive even worn them for outdoor road running and they were perfect for that as well my calves were sore after the first few times wearing them but ive noticed a tremendous improvement in my balance and stability in my training since these enable me to really use my feet as a foundation my foot measures a  but i wear a  in trainingrunning shoes bought these in a  and they were just right enough room for when my foot splays but not too big that i was tripping over them trailtalon  posted  reviewer christine kelly from overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars a little too soft no arch support tread is awesome trailtalon  posted  reviewer from overall rated  stars comfort rated stars style rated stars these fit really nice but the lugs are way more aggressive than useful for most trails
