business to be agile and able to move quicklyfor example if you’re looking to expand into the latin america market you’ll want to consider mercado libre the most popular and largest ecommerce site in

satisfying customers big box retailers have made shipping a priority by routinely examining and revamping their fulfillment methods resulting in solutions like amazon prime walmart’s twoday shipping subscription and ebay’s fast ‘n free initiativekeeping an eye on trends and adopting new relevant shipping methods will not only help improve customer satisfaction but it will also help small business owners meet their bottom lines and compete with the big dogshere are five logistics trends and strategies that all retail business owners should evaluate free shipping is expectedaccording to a deloitte survey free shipping is the top priority for shoppers when it comes to retail policies and nine in  shoppers prioritize free shipping over fast shipping when shopping onlinefor small businesses to remain competitive and avoid shopping cart abandonment they’ll need to strongly consider incorporating free shipping as an option as all businesses know shipping is never really freeon a basic level there are a few strategies to help businesses cover the cost of free shipping first increase product prices to cover shipping costs in this case the customer pays second the business pays the full price of shipping third the company slightly increases prices of products to cover some shipping costs so that both pay a portionbusinesses can also get creative offering free shipping when a customer hits a minimum order value this strategy can help by increasing an average order size therefore increasing profits to help offset shipping costs deliver packages at a specific timesome of consumers’ biggest pet peeves are receiving those “sorry we missed you” postage slips on their front door or even worse having a package stolen off their doorstepaccording to a temando survey  percent of consumers want a specified time slot for delivery and  percent are willing to pay a premium for it the good news is that the major carriers’ tracking information have significantly improved helping recipients know where their package is on its route and the estimated delivery date in addition most consumers know roughly when their mail carrier arrives each day and can oftentimes plan accordinglyfor even greater control over delivery times businesses can consider offering local customers ondemand delivery services such as uberrush or deliv with these services shoppers can

influencers such as jimmy wales cofounder of wikipedia gregg spiridellis cofounder of jibjab and barbara corcoran businesswoman and television personality on abc’s shark tank we couldn’t be more excited to have amine interviewed alongside these big names while we thought we’ve heard it all before we learned a few more fun facts about endicia’s founding that we wanted to share here are  things you might not know about endicia the name “endicia” was a last minute thought many people have trouble pronouncing our company name andrew warner included during the interview amine let andrew in on a little secret – coming up with a name was the very last thing on the list when founding the company there was no money to hire a creative marketing firm and – as a team of engineers –  endicia’s founders were more focused on building solutions than naming their business bonus fact – endicia is a play on the term “indicia” which is the name of markings on an envelope which indicate postage has been paid endicia wasn’t born overnight when we think about printing a shipping label it seems pretty easy but back in the day it wasn’t quite so simple it took more than nine years for the us postal service to approve amine and his cofounder harry’s idea to print postage from a personal computer in the meantime amine and harry worked on developing software to print envelopes and do bulk mailing the duo also went to the post office regularly and identified three big issues that people had – getting a tracking number paying for insurance and completing international forms while they were waiting for approval they worked to automate all of these tasks for online businesses no funding necessary before receiving approval from the usps to develop pc postage harry and amine kept themselves afloat by providing consulting services to other businesses and organizations they worked nights and built endicia software on the side as a result they never took outside funding and never used a single line of credit in the founding of endicia early customers came from online forums by  endicia had launched and the company needed customers it saw an opportunity with new online sellers that had to ship products quickly but didn’t necessarily know all their options endicia started going to online help forums such as ebay’s shipping forum and began answering questions for people who needed help online sellers began recognizing the endicia name and signing up for the software then those customers would tell other online sellers and the business began growing via word of mouth endicia built relationships with cookies starting in the ‘s endicia cofounder harry whitehouse began bringing chocolate chip cookies to meetings with customers the gesture became a calling card for endicia and helped the business solidify relationships in the early days today endicia still takes cookies with them to meetings – even international trade shows needless to say the cookie has become a part of our brand and helps the company maintain a personal touch follow this link to check out amine’s full interview “this company is everywhere and you’ve never even heard of them – with amine khechfe“
