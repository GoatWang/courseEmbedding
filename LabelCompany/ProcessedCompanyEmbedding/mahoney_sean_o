menuemily and sean   july     • philadelphia pa days agoour storyhow it all startedthis story begins with an east coast boy and a midwestern girl sean grew up in newtown connecticut he loved exploring new areas – from italy to dc eventually his path led him to law school in rhode island meanwhile emily moved away from her beloved hometown of kansas city missouri to start a big exciting college adventure in philadelphia by summer and fall of  both sean and emily had found themselves in the suburbs of philly sean had gotten a job offer and although he didnt know the first thing about the philadelphia area he found a place to call home in west chester and began his life as an attorney emily moved to the suburbs to start building her career as a dance teacher she didnt know much about the area outside of philadelphia itself but it was the beginning of a new chapter…just her and her dog sharing an apartment in a cute little suburban neighborhood by the spring of  both sean and emily had taken a leap of faith into the world of online dating emily although leery at first ended up fully embracing the concept she had several first dates set up and looked forward to getting to meet some different people the situation was strange fun and overwhelming all in one for her after a few nice experiences she still had one final first date set to go on and seriously considered canceling it she wondered if she should just focus on who she had already met and she certainly didnt want to waste this last persons time but curiosity got the best of her and she knew shed always wonder about this last guy sean if she didnt go out with him just like all wonderful cliché stories there was truly a spark the moment emily and sean locked eyes on that april evening dinner at one restaurant was followed by dessert at another and the night had endless laughs and great conversation it sure didnt take long during that first date for emily to realize that sean was sweeping the competition only a couple more dates went by full of the same joy and connection before the two became official theyve been inseparable ever sincethe proposalthe surprise proposal that sean planned began on an otherwise normal thursday eveningwhen emily a dance teacher walked into the studio for work she found a substitute teacher in her room and everyone from the office ready to greet her emily was still trying to make sense of everything when she was given instructions to go to the limo outside in the parking lot her dancers watched in excitement as she got into the limo to start her surprise adventure inside the limo she found a pretty box full of goodies sean knew she would want or need things like tissues and waterproof mascara there was also a notecard from sean and a photomontage dvd of their relationship with songs they love she hit play and the limo drove offthe first stop was the restaurant from their very first date the manager at the restaurant was waiting for emilys arrival he had wine  a bite to eat all ready for her along with a notecard from sean at the table afterwards she was back in the limo anxious to see what her second stop would be it was just a few blocks down…the restaurant they had gone to for dessert on their first date and here was some of that same dessert waiting for her at the very table they had been sitting at that night emily enjoyed reading a new meaningful notecard from sean for the third stop the limo surprised her by driving home inside the house their dog twinkie came running up to emily in none other than a flower girl dress emily was laughing and melting on the floor from twinkies cuteness when seans sister caitlin came around the corner and surprised her caitlin was happy to take care of twinkie for the night and she handed emily her next notecard from sean now the instructions were to change clothes and pack an overnight bag the adventure continuesemily was in for a longer ride to the fourth stop all the way into downtown philadelphia she didnt know it but there were two more stops with two more meaningful notecards ahead of her the limo pulled up in front of one of sean  emilys favorite philly date night restaurants here they had made her favorite lobster mashed potatoes for her even though it wasnt on the menu anymore such a treat the fifth stop was a muchloved chocolate restaurant the host inside the restaurant apologetically told emily that they didnt have room to seat her at a table but they had something to bring her if she wouldnt mind standing off to the side sneaky sean it took emily a few minutes to realize it but this was on purpose to represent when the two of them couldnt get a table here on their third dateemily wondered where the limo would go next and started hoping maybe she would get to see sean at the following stop she never expected the limo to pull up at the back entrance of elfreths alley – one of her favorite picturesque spots to visit in philly its the countrys oldest residential neighborhood thats been constantly inhabited since it was built the next thing she knew the limo driver opened the door and said follow the lights she started walking along the lit pathway of luminaries that had been setup and rounded the corner there was sean as emily got closer they held hands and sean spoke from the heart with the excitement and nerves neither one of them can even remember what exactly he said but then he got down on one knee and asked the big question emily of course said yesthey headed back to the room sean had reserved for them at the nearby beautiful hotel monaco sean had secretly requested off work for emily so they could enjoy the next day together it was a lovely morning of room service breakfast and watching the march snowfall after driving back home emily was totally blown away by a bridetobe basket full of bridal magazines wedding planning notebooks weddingthemed movies and chocolate sean had one last huge surprise up his sleeve… he flew emilys mom in from missouri so that they could be together for the rest of the weekend with both her mom and her future sisterinlaw by her side it was the perfect weekend of diving into bridal
