of benefits and risks the nature of the policy this prospectus describes three types of policies being offered by john hancock a variable whole life policy a variable whole life p  policy and a variable whole life  policy the policies described in this prospectus are available only in new york the minimum death benefit that may be bought is  for the whole life policy  for the whole life p  policy and  for the whole life  policy for the whole life policy and the whole life p  policy all persons insured must meet certain health and other criteria called underwriting standards all persons insured under the whole life  policy must meet preferred risk and nonsmoking underwriting standards all policies may be issued on insured persons between ages of  and  discounts are available to insured persons meeting nonsmoking underwriting criteria the policys primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person the policy is unsuitable as a shortterm savings vehicle because of the substantial policylevel charges we are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the policy the value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase or decrease daily based upon the investment results of the variable investment options that you choose the amount we pay to the policys beneficiary insured person we call this the death benefit may be similarly affected thats why the policy is referred to as a variable life insurance policy we call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments summary of policy benefits death benefit in your application for the policy you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person this is called the sum insured when the insured person dies we will pay the death benefit minus any indebtedness the death benefit will be an amount equal to the greater of the guaranteed minimum death benefit and the variable sum insured on the date of death of the insured person the variable sum insured is an amount equal to the initial sum insured at issue and thereafter varies as discussed under variable sum insured surrender of the policy you may surrender the policy in full at any time if you do we will pay you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy plus any dividends and interest unpaid or unapplied and the cash value of any insurance purchased under any dividend option with an adjustment to reflect the difference between the gross premium and the net premium for the period beyond the date of surrender less any indebtedness this is called your surrender value you must return your policy when you request a surrender if you have not taken a loan on your policy the cash value of your policy assuming you take all dividend payments in cash will on any given date be equal to o the amount you invested o plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options youve chosen and o minus all charges we deduct if you take a loan on your policy your cash value will be computed somewhat differently this is discussed under policy loans policy loans you may borrow from your policy at any time after the first policy year by completing the appropriate form the minimum amount of each loan is  the maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula interest is charged on each loan you can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the outstanding loan balance you can repay all or part of a loan at any time if there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies it will be deducted from the death benefit policy loans permanently affect the calculation of your cash value and may also result in adverse tax consequences  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th optional benefit riders when you apply for the policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we make available there are a number of such riders charges for most riders will be deducted monthly from the policys account value investment options the policy offers a number of investment options as listed on the cover of this prospectus they cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and strategies although the funds of the series funds that underlie those investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds there are important differences between your investment options and publiclytraded mutual funds on the plus side you can transfer money from one investment option to another without tax liability moreover any dividends and capital gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and reflected in the funds value and create no taxable event for you on the negative side if and when policy earnings are distributed generally as a result of a surrender or partial withdrawal they will be treated as ordinary income instead of as capital gains also you must keep in mind that you are purchasing an insurance policy and you will be assessed charges at the policy level as well as at the fund level such policy level charges are significant and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options summary of policy risks lapse risk if you dont pay a premium when due you will have a  day grace period to make that payment if you dont pay the premium by the end of the grace period your policy will terminate ie lapse all coverage under the policy will then cease even if the policy terminates in this way you can still reactivate ie reinstate it within  years from the beginning of the grace period unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted or the period of any extended term coverage discussed below has expired to reinstate the policy you must make the required premium payments and satisfying certain other conditions since withdrawals reduce your account value withdrawals increase the risk of lapse loans also increase the risk of lapse investment risk as mentioned above the investment performance of any variable investment option may be good or bad your account value will rise or fall based on the investment performance of the variable investment options youve chosen some variable investment options are riskier than others these risks and potential rewards are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the series funds transfer risk there is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value from one investment option to another because of limitations on the frequency of transfers you can make the limitations on transfers out of the fixed account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of investment accounts market timing risk variable investment options in variable life insurance products can be a prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable investment options without immediate tax consequences as a result some investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of variable investment options in reaction to market news or to exploit a perceived pricing inefficiency whatever the reason longterm investors in a variable investment option can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may expose the investment options underlying fund to increased portfolio transaction costs andor disrupt the fund managers ability to effectively manage the funds investment portfolio in accordance with the funds investment objectives and policies both of which may result in dilution with respect to interests held for longterm investment to discourage disruptive frequent trading activity we impose restrictions on transfers see transfers of existing account value and reserve the right to change suspend or terminate telephone and facsimile transaction privileges see how you communicate with us in addition we reserve the right to take other actions at any time to restrict trading including but not limited to i restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period ii restricting the dollar amount of transfers  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th and iii restricting transfers into and out of certain investment accounts we also reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of the underlying fund while we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity it may not always be possible to do so therefore no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to longterm investors tax risks in order for you to receive the tax benefits extended to life insurance under the internal revenue code your policy must comply with certain requirements of the code we will monitor your policy for compliance with these requirements but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of our monitoring if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all subsequent periods the tax laws also contain a socalled  pay limit that limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the policys death benefit if the limit is violated the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences there are also certain treasury department rules referred to as the investor control rules that determine whether you would be treated as the owner of the assets underlying your policy if that were determined to be the case you would be taxed on any income or gains those assets generate in other words you would lose the value of the socalled inside buildup that is a major benefit of life insurance there is also a tax risk associated with policy loans although no part of a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made surrender or lapse of the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time of lapse or surrender this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an insured person of advanced age you might find yourself having to choose between high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary there can also be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy ownership or assignment of ownership interests for these and all the other reasons mentioned above we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy

sum insured is determined once each policy month on the monthly date the monthly date is the first day of a policy month which day immediately follows a business day the variable sum insured remains level during the policy month following the determination changes in the variable sum insured for each policy month are computed by a formula filed with the insurance supervisory officials of the

policys assumed annual rate of  is translated on an actuarial basis into a change in the variable sum insured the variable sum insured would increase on the next monthly date only if the applicable

limitations on payment of death benefit if the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods the amount of death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy also if an application misstated the age or gender of the insured person we will adjust the amount of any death benefit as described in the policy the account value from each premium payment you make we deduct the charges described under deductions from premium payments below we invest the rest your socalled net premium in the investment options youve elected we invest an amount equal to each net premium for your policy on the date of issue and on each premium due date thereafter even if we actually receive your corresponding premium payment before or after that date over time the amount youve invested in any variable investment option will increase or decrease the same as if you had invested the same amount directly in the corresponding fund of the series fund and had reinvested all fund dividends and distributions in additional fund shares except that we will deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your cash value we describe these charges under description of charges at the policy level annual dividends these policies are participating policies which except while in force as fixed extended term insurance are entitled to the share if any of the divisible surplus which we annually determine and apportion to them any share will be distributed as a dividend payable annually on the policy anniversary beginning not later than the end of the second policy year for the variable whole life  policy and not later than the end of the third policy year for the variable whole life policy and variable whole life p policy dividends under participating policies may be described as refunds of premiums which adjust the cost of a policy to the actual level of cost emerging over time after the policys issue thus participating policies generally have gross premiums which are higher than those for comparable nonparticipating policies if a policy is surrendered before dividends become payable you do not benefit from having a participating policy both federal and state law recognize that dividends are considered to be a refund of a portion of the premium paid and therefore are not treated as income for federal or state income tax purposes dividend illustrations published at the time of issue of a policy reflect the actual recent experience of the issuing insurance company with respect to factors such as interest mortality and expenses state law generally prohibits a company from projecting or estimating future results state law also requires that dividends must be based on surplus after setting aside certain necessary amounts and that such surplus must be apportioned equitably among participating policies in other words in principle and by statute dividends must be based on actual experience and cannot be guaranteed at issue of a policy each year our actuaries analyze the current and recent past experience and compare it to the assumptions used in determining the premium rates at the time of issue some of the more important data studied includes mortality and withdrawal rates investment yield in the general account and actual expenses incurred in administering the policies such data is then allocated to each dividend class eg by year of issue age smoking habits and plan the actuaries then determine what dividends can be equitably apportioned to each policy class and make a recommendation to our board of directors the board of directors which has the ultimate authority to ascertain dividends will vote the amount of surplus to be apportioned to each policy class thereby authorizing the distribution of each years dividend

to do so you must tell us how much to transfer either as a whole number percentage or as a specific dollar amount you may not make more than six transfers in each policy year a confirmation of each transfer will be sent to you the policies are not designed for professional market timing organizations or other persons or entities that use programmed or frequent transfers among investment options as a consequence we have reserved the right to impose limits on the number and frequency of transfers into and out of variable investment options under our current rules we impose the following restrictions on transfers into and out of variable investment options transfers out of a fixed investment option are subject to additional limitations noted below subject to the annual restriction noted above our current practice is to restrict transfers into or out of variable investment options to two per calendar month except with respect to those policies described in the following paragraph for purposes of this restriction and in applying the limitation on the number of free transfers made during the period from the opening of a business day usually  am eastern time to the close of that business day usually  pm eastern time are considered one transfer you may however transfer to the money market b investment option even if the two transfer per month limit has been reached but only if  of the account value in all variable investment options is transferred to the money market b investment option if such a transfer to the money market b investment option is made then for the  calendar day period after such transfers no transfers from the money market b investment option to any other investment options variable or fixed may be made if your policy offers a dollar cost averaging or automatic asset allocation rebalancing program any transfers pursuant to such program are not considered transfers subject to these restrictions on frequent trading the restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions policies such as yours may be purchased by a corporation or other entity as a means to informally finance the liabilities created by an employee benefit plan and to this end the entity may aggregately manage the policies purchased to match its liabilities under the plan policies sold under these circumstances are subject to special transfer restrictions in lieu of the two transfers per month restriction but still subject to the annual restriction noted above we will allow the policy owner under these circumstances to rebalance the investment options in its policies within the following limits i during the  calendar day period after any account values are transferred from one variable investment option into a second variable investment option the values can only be transferred out of the second investment option if they are transferred into the money market b investment option and ii any account values that would otherwise not be transferable by application of the  day limit described above and that are transferred into the money market b investment option may not be transferred out of the money market b investment option into any other investment options variable or fixed for  calendar days the restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions if we change any of the above rules relating to transfers we will notify you of the change limitation on number of investment options whether through the allocation of premium or through the transfer of existing cash value you can never be invested in more than five investment options at any one time surrender you may surrender your policy in full at any time for its surrender value you must return your policy when you request a full surrender the surrender value will be the policy cash value plus any dividends and interest unpaid or

unless it is at least  you may repay all or a portion of any indebtedness while the insured person is living and premiums are being duly paid any loan is charged against the variable investment options in proportion to the policy cash value allocated to the variable investment options and upon repayment the repayment is allocated to the variable investment options in proportion to the outstanding indebtedness in each variable investment option at such time we determine the variable loan interest rate annually the fixed loan interest rate is  for the life of the policy at the time of issue you can elect which loan interest rate will apply to any policy loan if permitted by the law of the state in which the policy is issued you may change a prior choice of loan interest rate if at the time of such request there is outstanding indebtedness the change will generally become effective on the next policy anniversary the variable loan interest rate determined annually for a policy will apply to all indebtedness outstanding during the policy year following the date of determination the rate will not exceed the higher of  or the published monthly average as defined below for the

rate that is not more than  below the interest rate we are then charging on the loan assuming no taxes repayment of policy loans if you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment you must include instructions to that effect otherwise all payments will be assumed to be premium payments we process loan repayments as of the day we receive the repayment effects of policy loans the cash value the net cash surrender value and the death benefit are permanently affected by any loan whether or not it is repaid in whole or in part this is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options and placed in a special loan account the investment options and the special loan account will generally have different rates of investment return the amount of any outstanding indebtedness is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable whenever the outstanding indebtedness equals or exceeds the policys cash value plus any cash values under a dividend option providing paidup insurance the policy will terminate  days after we have mailed notice of termination to you and to any assignee of record at such assignees last known address specifying the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within that period also taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the policy may lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged on the loan and the interest rate credited to the special loan account policy loans may also result in

premium tax charge  a charge to cover expected state premium taxes we must pay on average this charge is  of each premium o adjustment for premium payment frequency  if you select a premium payment mode other than annual so that we receive your premiums over the course of the year rather than all at the beginning there will be less value in your policy to support it during the course of the year to compensate for the risk to us that this creates the rate we set for each non annual premium includes an additional amount that we retain rather than crediting it to your policy o annual administrative charge  a charge of  in each policy year to help defray our annual administrative expenses o charge for extra insurance risk  the amount of premiums we may require may include an additional component if the insured person presents particular mortality risks we retain these additional amounts to compensate us for that risk o optional benefits charge  the amount of premiums we require is increased by an additional component to cover any optional rider benefits you choose for your policy we retain such additional amounts to compensate us for the obligations we assume under the riders o premium sales charge  a charge not to exceed  of the basic annual premium during the period equal to the lesser of  years or the anticipated life expectancy of the insured person based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality table the basic annual premium is the annual premium less the premiums for any optional rider benefits additional charges for extra mortality risks and the  annual administrative charge the charge during the first two policy years shall not exceed  of the basic annual premium paid during the first policy year plus  of the basic annual premium paid for the second policy year charges of  or less are made for later policy year o additional first year administrative charge  a charge in the first policy year at the rate of  per  of the initial sum insured as shown in the policy for a variable whole life policy  per  for a variable whole life p policy and  per  for a variable whole life  policy or a pro rata portion thereof to cover administrative expenses in connection with the issuance of the policy o risk charge  a charge necessary to cover the risk we assumed that the variable sum insured will be less than the guaranteed minimum death benefit this charge will vary by age of the insured person but averages approximately  of the basic annual premium o deduction for dividends  a deduction for dividends to be paid or credited in accordance with the dividend scale in effect on the issue date of the policy this deduction will vary by age of the insured person and duration of the policy but is expected to average approximately  of the basic annual premium deductions from account assets o insurance charge  a monthly charge for the cost of insurance to determine the charge we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are at risk by a cost of insurance rate the rate is derived from an actuarial table the table in your policy will show the maximum cost of insurance rates the cost of insurance rates will never be more than those based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables cost of insurance rates generally increase each year that you own your policy as the insured persons attained age increases the insured persons attained age on any date is his or her age on the birthday nearest that date o m  e charge  a daily charge for mortality and expense risks we assume this charge is deducted from the variable investment options the current charge is at an effective annual rate of  of the value of the assets in each variable investment option we guarantee that this charge will never exceed an effective annual rate of  additional information about how certain policy charges work sales expenses and related charges the premium sales charges help to compensate us for the cost of selling our policies see description of charges at the policy level the amount of the charges in any policy year does not specifically correspond to sales expenses for that year we expect to recover our total sales expenses over the life of the policy to the extent that the sales charges do not cover total sales expenses the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources including gains from the charge for mortality and expense risks and other gains with respect to the policies or from our general assets similarly administrative expenses not  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd fully covered by the annual administrative charge and the additional first year administrative charge may also be recovered from such other sources method of deduction we deduct the monthly charges described in the section from your policys investment options in proportion to the amount of cash value you have in each other charges we could impose in the future we currently make no charge for our federal income taxes however if we incur or expect to incur additional income taxes attributable to any subaccount of the account or this class of policies in future years we reserve the right to make a charge for such taxes any such charge would reduce what you earn on any affected investment options however we expect that no such charge will be necessary under current laws we may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws we may make charges for such taxes description of charges at the fund level the funds must pay investment management fees and other operating expenses these fees and expenses shown in the fee tables section are different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund therefore they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable investment options you select expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified under the terms of the policy and those expenses may vary from year to year other policy benefits rights and limitations optional benefit riders you can add when you apply for a policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we then make available availability of any rider the benefits it provides and the charges for it may vary by state our rules and procedures will govern eligibility for any rider and in some cases the configuration of the actual rider benefits each rider contains specific details that you should review before you decide to choose the rider we may change rider premiums or the rates that determine them but not above any applicable maximum amount stated in the policy specifications page

the policies of one issuer over another issuer or one product over another product you should contact your registered representative for more information on compensation arrangements in connection with your purchase of a policy tax considerations this description of federal income tax consequences is only a brief summary and is not intended as tax advice tax consequences will vary based on your own particular circumstances and for further information you should consult a qualified tax adviser federal state and local tax laws regulations and interpretations can change from time to time as a result the tax consequences to you and the beneficiary may be altered in some cases retroactively the policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement therefore if the use of the policy in any such arrangment the value of which depends in part on the tax consequences is contemplated a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for advise on the tax attributes of the particular arrangement general generally death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not subject to income tax earnings on your account value are ordinarily not subject to income tax as long as we dont pay them out to you if we do pay out any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal all or part of that distribution would generally be treated as a return of the premiums youve paid and not subjected to income tax however certain distributions associated with a reduction in death benefit or other policy benefits within the first  years after issuance of the policy are ordinarily taxable in whole or in part see other policy distributions below amounts you borrow are generally not taxable to you see policy loans below however some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a modified endowment contract this can happen if youve paid premiums in excess of limits prescribed by the tax laws additional taxes and penalties may be payable for policy distributions of any kind see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status below policy death benefit proceeds we expect the policy to receive the same federal income and estate tax treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies section  of the internal revenue code the code defines a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes for a policy to be treated as a life insurance contract it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline premium test these tests limit the amount of premium that you may pay into the policy we will monitor compliance with these standards if we determine that a policy does not satisfy section  we may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to bring it into compliance with section  if the policy complies with section  the death benefit proceeds under the policy should be excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section  of the code other policy distributions increases in policy value as a result of interest or investment experience will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are received through actual or deemed distributions in general the owner will be taxed on the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the policy owner in order for the policy to continue to comply with the section  definitional limits changes that reduce benefits include partial withdrawals and death benefit option changes for purposes of this rule any distribution within the two years immediately before a reduction in benefits will also be treated as if it caused the reduction a cash distribution that reduces policy benefits will be taxed in whole or in part to the extent of any gain in the policy under rules prescribed in section  the taxable amount is subject to limits prescribed in section f any taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner rather than capital gain distributions for tax purposes include amounts received upon surrender or partial withdrawals you may also be deemed to have received a distribution for tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your policys ownership  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th it is possible that despite our monitoring a policy might fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the code this could happen for example if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium payments that were in excess of permitted amounts or if any of the funds failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements of the code if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to the policy from the date of issue to the date of the disqualification and for subsequent periods tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws will depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary if the person insured by the policy is also its owner either directly or indirectly through an entity such as a revocabale trust the death benefit will be includible in his or her estate for purposes of the federal estate tax if the owner is not the person insured the value of the policy will be includible in the owners estate upon his or her death even if ownership has been transferred the death proceeds or the account value may be includible in the former owners estate if the transfer occurred less than three years before the former owners death or if the former owner retained certain kinds of control over the policy you should consult your tax adviser regarding these possible tax consequences because there may be unfavorable tax consequences including recognition of taxable income and the loss of income taxfree treatment for any death benefit payable to the beneficiary you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to changing the policys ownership or making any assignment of ownership interests policy loans we expect that except as noted below see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status loans received under the policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will constitute income to the owner however if the policy terminates for any reason the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such termination this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans you might find yourself having to choose between high premiums requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur diversification rules and ownership of the account your policy will not qualify for the tax benefits of a life insurance contract unless the account follows certain rules requiring diversification of investments underlying the policy in addition the rules require that the policy owner not have investment control over the underlying assets in certain circumstances the owner of a variable life insurance policy may be considered the owner for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the separate account used to support the policy in those circumstances income and gains from the separate account assets would be includible in the policy owners gross income the internal revenue service irs has stated in published rulings that a variable policy owner will be considered the owner of separate account assets if the policy owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets a treasury decision issued in  stated that guidance would be issued in the form of regulations or rulings on the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts of a separate account without being treated as owners of the underlying assets as of the date of this prospectus no comprehensive guidance on this point has been issued in rev rul  however the irs ruled that a contract holder would not be treated as the owner of assets underlying a variable life insurance or annuity contract despite the owners ability to allocate funds among as many as twenty subaccounts the ownership rights under your policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described in irs rulings in which it was determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account assets since you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was the case in those rulings it is possible that you would be treated as the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account we do not know what future treasury department regulations or other guidance may require we cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to operate as currently described in the series funds prospectuses or that a series fund will not have to change any funds investment objectives or policies we have reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe doing so will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account but we are under no obligation to do so  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status at the time of policy issuance we will determine whether the planned premium schedule will exceed the pay limit discussed below if so our standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form acknowledging that fact the pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully paidup after the payment of  equal annual premiums paidup means that no further premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity based on certain prescribed assumptions if the total premiums paid at any time during the first  policy years exceed the pay limit the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the following tax rules o first all partial withdrawals from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the policy value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy at such time o second loans taken from or secured by such a policy and assignments or pledges of any part of its value are treated as partial withdrawals from the policy and taxed accordingly pastdue loan interest that is added to the loan amount is treated as an additional loan o third a  additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution including distributions on surrender from or loan taken from or secured by such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan o is made on or after the date on which the policy owner attains age  o is attributable to the policy owner becoming disabled or o is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the policy owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the policy owner and the policy owners beneficiary these exceptions to the  additional tax do not apply in situations where the policy is not owned by an individual furthermore any time there is a material change in a policy the policy will begin a new pay testing period as if it were a newlyissued policy the material change rules for determining whether a policy is a modified endowment contract are complex in general however the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change generally depends upon the relationship among the death benefit of the policy at the time of such change the policy value at the time of the change and the additional premiums paid into the policy during the seven years starting with the date on which the material change occurs moreover if benefits under a policy are reduced such as a reduction in the death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits during the  years in which a pay test is being applied the pay limit will generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits if the premiums paid to date are greater than the recalculated pay limit the policy will become a modified endowment contract all modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year generally are required to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified endowment contract rules a policy received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will itself also be a modified endowment contract you should consult your tax advisor if you have questions regarding the possible impact of the pay limit on your policy corporate and hr  retirement plans the policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement plans satisfying the qualification requirements of section  of the code if so the code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits thereunder should be carefully scrutinized we are not responsible for compliance with the terms of any such plan or with the requirements of applicable provisions of the code withholding to

you choose the amount we pay to the policys beneficiary last surviving insured person we call this the death benefit may be similarly affected thats why the policy is referred to as a variable life insurance policy we call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments the amount we require as your first premium depends upon the specifics of your policy and the insured person except as noted in the detailed information section of this prospectus you can make any other premium payments you wish at any time thats why the policy is called a flexible premium policy if the life insurance protection described in this prospectus is provided under a master group policy the term policy as used in this prospectus refers to the certificate we issue and not to the master group policy summary of policy benefits death benefit when the last of the insured persons dies we will pay the death benefit minus any outstanding loans there are two ways of calculating the death benefit option a and option b you choose which one you want in the application the two death benefit options are  option a  the death benefit will equal the greater of  the total sum insured plus any optional extra death benefit if elected as described below or  the minimum insurance amount as described under the minimum insurance amount provision in the detailed information section of this prospectus  option b  the death benefit will equal the greater of  the total sum insured plus your policys account value on the date of death of the last surviving insured person or  the minimum insurance amount surrender of the policy you may surrender the policy in full at any time if you do we will pay you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy loans and less any contingent deferred sales charge that then applies this is called your surrender value you must return your policy when you request a surrender if you have not taken a loan on your policy the account value of your policy will on any given date be equal to  the amount you invested  plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options youve chosen  minus all charges we deduct and  minus all withdrawals you have made if you take a loan on your policy your account value will be computed somewhat differently this is discussed beginning on page xx partial withdrawals you may make a partial withdrawal of your surrender value at any timeafter the first policy year each withdrawal must be at least  there is a charge usually  for each partial withdrawal your account value is automatically reduced by  the amount of the withdrawal and the charge we reserve the right to refuse a partial withdrawal if it would reduce the surrender value or the total sum insured below certain minimum amounts policy loans you may borrow from your policy at any time by completing the appropriate form the minimum amount of each loan is  the maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula interest is charged on each loan you can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the outstanding loan balance you can repay all or part of a loan at any time if there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies it will be deducted from the death benefit outstanding loans are also deducted from your account value in order to determine your account value optional benefit riders when you apply for the policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we make available there are a number of such riders charges for most riders will be deducted monthly from the policys account value investment options the policy offers a number of investment options as listed on the cover of this prospectus they cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and strategies although the funds of the series funds that underly those investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds there are important differences between your investment options and publiclytraded mutual funds on the plus side you can transfer money from one investment option to another without tax liability moreover any dividends and capital gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and reflected in the funds value and create no taxable event for you on the negative side if and when policy earnings are distributed generally as a result of a surrender or partial withdrawal they will be treated as ordinary income instead of as capital gains also you must keep in mind that you are purchasing an insurance policy and you will be assessed charges at the policy level as well as at the fund level such policy level charges are significant and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options summary of policy risks lapse risk if the account value of your policy is insufficient to pay the charges when due your policy or part of it can terminate ie lapse this can happen because you havent paid enough premiums or because the investment performance of the investment options youve chosen has been poor or because of a combination of both factors youll be given a grace period within which to make additional premium payments to keep the policy in effect if lapse occurs youll be given the opportunity to reinstate the policy by making the required premium payments and satisfying certain other conditions investment risk as mentioned above the investment performance of any variable investment option may be good or bad your account value will rise or fall based on the investment performance of the variable investment options youve chosen some variable investment options are riskier than others these risks and potential rewards are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the series funds access to funds risk there is a risk that you will not be able or willing to access your account value by surrendering the policy because of the contingent deferred sales charge cdsc that may be payable upon surrender the cdsc is a percentage of the premiums youve paid and disappears only after  policy years have passed see the fee tables section of this prospectus for details on the cdsc there is also a charge for each partial withdrawal you make it is the lesser of  or  of the withdrawal  amount any communication that arrives on a date that is not a business day will be processd on the business day next following that date the term business day is defined on page xx transfer risk there is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value from one investment option to another because of limitations on the dollar amount or frequency of transfers you can make the limitation on transfers out of the fixed account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of variable investment options tax risks in order for you to receive the tax benefits accorded life insurance under the internal revenue code your policy must comply with certain requirements of the code we will monitor your policy for compliance with these requirements but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of our monitoring if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all subsequent periods the tax laws also contain a socalled  pay limit that limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the policys death benefit if the limit is violated the policy will be treated as a modified endowment which can have adverse tax consequences there are also certain treasury department rules referred to as the investor control rules that determine whether you would be treated as the owner of the assets underlying your policy if that were determined to be the case you would be taxed on any income or gains those assets generate in other words you would lose the value of the socalled inside buildup that is a major benefit of life insurance there is also a tax risk associated with policy loans although no part of a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made surrender or lapse of the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time of lapse or surrender this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an insured person of advanced age you might find yourself having to choose between high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary there can also be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy ownership or assignment of ownership interests for these and all the other reasons mentioned above we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy  fee tables this section contains five tables that describe all of the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying owning and surrendering the policy in the first three tables certain entries show the minimum charge the maximum charge and the charge for a representative insured person other entries show only the maximum charge we can assess and are labeled as such the remaining entries are always calculated in the same way so we cannot assess a charge

an effective annual rate of at least  without regard to the actual investment experience of the general account because of exemptive and exclusionary provisions interests in our fixed investment option have not been registered under the securities act of  and our general account has not been registered as an investment company under the  act accordingly neither the general account nor any interests therein are subject to the provisions of these acts and we have been advised that the staff of the sec has not reviewed the disclosure in this prospectus relating to the fixed investment option disclosure regarding the fixed investment option may however be subject to certain generallyapplicable provisions of the federal securities laws relating to accuracy and completeness of statements made in prospectuses premiums planned premiums the policy specifications page of your policy will show the planned premium for the policy you choose this amount in the policy application you will also choose how often to pay premiums annually semiannually quarterly or monthly the premium reminder notice we send you is based on the amount and period you choose however payment of planned premiums is not necessarily required you need only invest enough to keep the policy in force see lapse and reinstatement on page xx maximum premium payments federal tax law limits the amount of premium payments you can make relative to the amount of your policys insurance coverage we will not knowingly accept any amount by which a premium payment exceeds the maximum if you exceed certain other limits the law may impose a penalty on amounts you take out of your policy more discussion of these tax law requirements begins on page xx also we may refuse to accept any amount of an additional premium if  that amount of premium would increase our insurance risk exposure and  the insured persons dont provide us with adequate evidence that he or she continues to meet our requirements for issuing insurance in no event however will we refuse to accept any premium necessary to prevent the policy from terminating or to keep the guaranteed death benefit feature in effect ways to pay premiums if you pay premiums by check or money order they must be drawn on a us bank in us dollars and made payable to john hancock life we will not accept credit card checks we will not accept starter or third party checks if they fail to satisfy our administrative requirements premiums after the first must be sent to the jhvlico life servicing office at the appropriate address shown on page xx of this prospectus  we will also accept premiums  by wire or by exchange from another insurance company  via an electronic funds transfer program any owner interested in making monthly premium payments must use this method or  if we agree to it through a salary deduction plan with your employer you can obtain information on these other methods of premium payment by contacting your jhvlico representative or by contacting the jhvlico life servicing office processing premium payments we will process any premium payment as of the day we receive it unless one of the following exceptions applies  we will process a payment received prior to a policys date of issue as if received on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue  if the minimum initial premium is not received prior to the date of issue we will process each premium payment received thereafter as if received on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue until all of the minimum initial premium is received  we will process the portion of any premium payment for which we require evidence of the insured persons continued insurability only after we have received such evidence and found it satisfactory to us  if we receive any premium payment that we think will cause a policy to become a modified endowment or will cause a policy to lose its status as life insurance under the tax laws we will not accept the excess portion of that premium payment and will immediately notify the owner we will refund the excess premium when the premium payment check has had time to clear the banking system but in no case more than two weeks after receipt except in the following circumstances  the tax problem resolves itself prior to the date the refund is to be made or  the tax problem relates to modified endowment status and we receive a signed acknowledgment from the owner prior to the refund date instructing us to process the premium notwithstanding the tax issues involved in the above cases we will treat the excess premium as having been received on the date the tax problem resolves itself or the date we receive the signed acknowledgment we will then process it accordingly  if a premium payment is received or is otherwise scheduled to be processed as specified above on a date that is not a business day the premium payment will be processed on the business day next following that date lapse and reinstatement either your entire policy or the additional sum insured portion of your total sum insured can terminate ie lapse for failure to pay charges due under the policy during the first  policy years there can be no lapse of any kind if the guaranteed death benefit feature is in effect see below if the guaranteed death benefit feature is in effect after the th policy year the additional sum insured and any additional benefit riders unless otherwise stated therein will be in default may lapse if the policys surrender value is not sufficient to pay the charges on a grace period testing date if the guaranteed death benefit feature is not in effect the entire policy will be in default may lapse if the policys surrender value is not sufficient to pay the charges on a grace period testing date in either case we will notify you of how much you will need to pay to keep the additional sum insured or the policy in force you will have a  day grace period to make these payments if you pay these amounts during the grace period you may also continue the guaranteed death benefit feature by paying the necessary amount of gdb premiums if you dont pay at least the required amount by the end of the grace period the additional sum insured and any additional benefit riders unless otherwise stated therein or your policy as the case may be will lapse if your policy lapses all coverage under the policy will cease even if the policy or the additional sum insured terminates in this way you can still reactivate ie  reinstate it within  years from the beginning of the grace period you will have to provide evidence that the insured person still meets our requirements for issuing coverage you will also have to pay a minimum amount of premium and be subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to reinstatements as specified in the policy reinstatement of a lapsed policy or additional sum insured will take effect on the monthly deduction date on or next following the date we approve the reinstatement request if the guaranteed death benefit is not in effect and the last surviving insured person dies during the grace period we will deduct any unpaid monthly charges from the death benefit during a grace period you cannot make a partial withdrawal or policy loan guaranteed death benefit feature this feature guarantees that your basic sum insured will not terminate ie lapse regardless of adverse investment performance if on each grace period testing date the amount of cumulative premiums you have paid less all withdrawals from the policy and all outstanding loans equals or exceeds the sum of all guaranteed death benefit premium gdb premium due to date for the first  policy years the same applies to any amount of additional sum insured if the guaranteed death benefit test is not satisfied on any grace period testing date the guaranteed death benefit feature will not be in effect on that date we currently test on a quarterly basis but reserve the right to test on each monthly deduction date the term  monthly deduction date is defined on page xx under procedures for issuance of a policy your policy will show two types of gdb premium or such other types as permitted by your state   year gdb premium  this is used on each grace period testing date until the th policy anniversary the total gdb premium that is due to date on any grace period testing date during this period is equal to the  year gdb premium times the number of elapsed policy months from the policys date of issue through the grace period testing date  age  gdb premium  this is used on each grace period testing date that occurs on and after the th policy anniversary until the policy anniversary nearest the younger insured persons th birthday regardless of whether such younger insured person remains alive until that policy anniversary the total gdb premium that is due to date on any grace period testing date during this period is equal to the age  gdb premium times the number of elapsed policy months from the policys date of issue through the grace period testing date the age  gdb premium is higher than the  year gdb premium but neither of them will ever be greater than the socalled guideline premium for the policy as defined in section  of the internal revenue code for the first  policy years the guaranteed death benefit feature applies to both the basic sum insured and additional sum insured then in effect and any riders then in effect on the th policy anniversary and there after the guaranteed death benefit feature applies only to the basic sum insured in effect when we issue the policy and does not apply to any amount of additional sum insured or any rider benefits if you increase the total sum insured see how much will we pay when the last insured person dies on page xx the guaranteed death benefit feature will cease to be in effect on the date such increase takes effect or the th policy anniversary whichever is later if there is a decrease in the total sum insured or a change in death benefit option the  year gdb premium and the age  gdb premium may be changed in making any due date calculation described above after the effective date of the change the old gdb premium will apply up to the effective date of the change and the new gdb premium will be multiplied by the number of elapsed policy months from the effective date of the change through the grace period testing date if there are monthly charges that remain unpaid because of this guaranteed death benefit feature we will deduct such charges when there is sufficient account value to pay them if an insufficient amount of gdb premium has been paid on a grace period testing date and your policy would lapse for failure to pay charges then due we will provide you with a notification as described in the next section lapse and reinstatement  the death benefit in your application for the policy you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the lives of the insured persons this is called the total sum insured total sum insured is composed of the basic sum insured and any additional sum insured you elect the maximum amount of additional sum insured you can have when we issue the policy is generally limited to  of the basic sum insured the application may also give you the option of electing among various patterns of scheduled increases in additional sum insured there are a number of factors you should consider in determining whether to elect coverage in the form of basic sum insured or in the form of additional sum insured these factors are discussed under basic sum insured vs additional sum insured on page xx when the last of the insured persons dies we will pay the death benefit minus any outstanding loans there are two ways of calculating the death benefit you must choose which one you want in the application the two death benefit options are  option a  the death benefit will equal the greater of  the total sum insured plus any optional extra death benefit if elected as described below or  the minimum insurance amount as described below  option b  the death benefit will equal the greater of  the total sum insured plus your policys account value on the date of death of the last surviving insured person or  the minimum insurance amount for the same premium payments the death benefit under option b will tend to be higher than the death benefit under option a on the other hand the monthly insurance charge will be higher under option b to compensate us for the additional insurance risk because of that the account value will tend to be higher under option a than under option b for the same premium payments limitations on payment of death benefit if the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods the amount of death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy also if an application misstated the age or gender of the insured person we will adjust the amount of any death benefit as described in the policy basic sum insured vs additional sum insured as noted earlier in this prospectus you should consider a number of factors in determining whether to elect coverage in the form of basic sum insured or in the form of additional sum insured for the same amount of premiums paid the amount of the issue charge deducted from account value and the amount of compensation paid to the selling insurance agent will generally be less if coverage is included as additional sum insured rather than as basic sum insured on the other hand the amount of any additional sum insured is not included in the guaranteed death benefit feature after the th policy year and is not extended beyond the age  adjustment date the age  adjustment date is defined under when the younger insured person reaches  on page xx therefore if the policys surrender value is insufficient to pay the monthly charges as they fall due including the charges for the additional sum insured after the th policy year the additional sum insured coverage will lapse even if the basic sum insured stays in effect pursuant to the guaranteed death benefit feature generally you will incur lower issue charges and have more flexible coverage with respect to the additional sum insured than with respect to the basic sum insured if this is your priority you may wish to maximize the proportion of the additional sum insured however if your priority is to take advantage of the guaranteed death benefit feature after the th policy year the proportion of the policys total sum insured that is guaranteed can be increased by taking out more coverage as basic sum insured at the time of policy issuance in addition the death benefit after the age  adjustment date will generally be larger if the proportion of basic sum insured immediately prior to that date is larger any decision you make to modify the amount of additional sum insured coverage after issue can have significant tax consequences see tax considerations beginning on page xx  the minimum insurance amount in order for a policy to qualify as life insurance under federal tax law there has to be a minimum amount of insurance in relation to account value there are two tests that can be applied under federal tax law  the guideline premium and cash value corridor test and the cash value accumulation test when you elect the death benefit option you must also elect which test you wish to have applied as indicated above the guideline premium and cash value corridor test is not available if the optional extra death benefit feature is elected under the guideline premium and cash value corridor test we compute the minimum insurance amount each business day by multiplying the account value on that date by the death benefit factor called corridor factor in the policy applicable on that date in this case the factors are derived by applying the guideline premium and cash value corridor test the factor starts out at  for ages at or below  and decreases as attained age increases reaching a low of  at age  a table showing the factor for each age will appear in the policy under the cash value accumulation test we compute the minimum insurance amount each business day by multiplying the account value on that date by the death benefit factor applicable on that date in this case the factors are derived by applying the cash value accumulation test the factor decreases as attained age increases a table showing the factor for each age will appear in the policy regardless of which test is applied the appropriate factor will be referred to in the policy as the required additional death benefit factor as noted above you have to elect which test will be applied if you elect the option a death benefit the cash value accumulation test may be preferable if you want an increasing death benefit in later policy years andor want to fund the policy at the  pay limit for the full  years see tax considerations beginning on page xx the guideline premium and cash value corridor test may be preferable if you want the account value under the policy to increase without increasing the death benefit as quickly as might otherwise be required when the younger insured person reaches  if the policy is still in effect on the policy anniversary nearest the th birthday of the younger of the two insured persons the following things will happen whether or not the younger insured person is actually alive on that policy anniversary  we will stop deducting any monthly charges other than the assetbased risk charge and will stop accepting any premium payments  the death benefit will become equal to the basic sum insured plus a percentage of the account value on the date of death of the last surviving insured person the percentage will be equal to the ratio of additional sum insured to total sum insured on the day immediately preceding the age  adjustment date death benefit options a and b as described above and the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature will all cease to apply requesting an increase in coverage you may request an increase in the additional sum insured as to when such an increase would take effect see effective date of other policy transactions on page xx generally each such increase must be at least  however you will have to provide us with evidence that the insured person still meets our requirements for issuing insurance coverage unless we consent otherwise you may not increase the additional sum insured if the increase would cause the entire additional sum insured to equal or exceed  of the basic sum insured requesting a decrease in coverage after the first policy year you may request a reduction in the total sum insured but only if  the remaining basic sum insured will be at least  and  the remaining additional sum insured will not exceed  of the basic sum insured and  the remaining total sum insured will at least equal the minimum required by the tax laws to maintain the policys life insurance status we may refuse any decrease in additional sum insured if it would cause the death benefit to increase pursuant to the optional extra death benefit feature as to when any reduction in total sum insured would take effect see effective date of other policy transactions on page xx any reduction in total sum insured will be implemented by first reducing any  additional sum insured if there is any reduction in basic sum insured a prorata portion of the applicable cdsc will be deducted from the account value see contingent deferred sales charge cdsc on page xx change of death benefit option you may change your coverage from death benefit option b to option a on any policy anniversary but only if there is no change in the federal tax law test used to determine the minimum insurance amount a change from death benefit option a to option b is not permitted under our administrative rules please read the minimum insurance amount on page xx for more information about the guideline premium and cash value corridor test and the cash value accumulation test effective date of other policy transactions the following transactions take effect on the policy anniversary on or next following the date we approve your request  total sum insured decreases  additional sum

read tax considerations starting on page xx to learn about possible tax consequences of changing your insurance coverage under the policy your beneficiary you name your beneficiary when you apply for the policy the beneficiary is entitled to the proceeds we pay following the death of the last surviving insured person you may change the beneficiary during that insured persons lifetime such a change requires the consent of any irrevocable named beneficiary a new beneficiary designation is effective as of the date you sign it but will not affect any payments we make before we receive it if no beneficiary is living when the last surviving insured person dies we will pay the insurance proceeds to the owner or the owners estate ways in which we pay out policy proceeds you may choose to receive proceeds from the policy as a single sum this includes proceeds that become payable because of death or full surrender alternatively you can elect to have proceeds of  or more applied to any of a number of other payment options including the following  option   proceeds left with us to accumulate with interest  option a  equal monthly payments of a specified amount until all proceeds are paid out  option b  equal monthly payments for a specified period of time  option   equal monthly payments for life but with payments guaranteed for a specific number of years  option   equal monthly payments for life with no refund  option   equal monthly payments for life with a refund if all of the proceeds havent been paid out you cannot choose an option if the monthly payments under the option would be less than  we will issue a supplementary agreement when the proceeds are applied to any alternative payment option that agreement will spell out the terms of the option in full we will credit interest on each of the above options for options  and a the interest will be at least an effective annual rate of  if no alternative payment option has been chosen proceeds will be paid as a single sum  changing a payment option you can change the payment option at any time before the proceeds are payable if you havent made a choice the payee of the proceeds has a prescribed period in which he or she can make that choice tax impact of payment option chosen there may be tax consequences to you or your beneficiary depending upon which payment option is chosen you should consult with a qualified tax adviser before making that choice the account value from each premium payment you make we deduct the charges described under deductions from premium payments below we invest the rest in the investment options youve elected special investment rules apply to premiums processed prior to the th day after your policy becomes effective see commencement of investment performance beginning on page xx over time the amount youve invested in any variable investment option will increase or decrease the same as if you had invested the same amount directly in the corresponding fund of a series fund and had reinvested all fund dividends and distributions in additional fund shares except that we will deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your account value we describe these charges under description of charges at the policy level beginning on page xx the amount youve invested in the fixed investment option will earn interest at a rate we declare from time to time we guarantee that this rate will be at least  if you want to know what the current declared rate is just call or write to us amounts you invest in the fixed investment option will not be subject to the assetbased risk charge described on page xx otherwise the charges applicable to the fixed investment option are the same as those applicable to the variable investment options commencement of investment performance any premium payment processed prior to the twentieth day after the policys date of issue will automatically be allocated to the money market investment option on the later of the date such payment is received or the twentieth day following the date of issue the portion of the money market investment option attributable to such payment will be reallocated automatically among the investment options you have chosen all other premium payments will be allocated among the investment options you have chosen as soon as they are processed allocation of future premium payments at any time you may change the investment options in which future premium payments will be invested you make the original allocation in the application for the policy the percentages you select must be in whole numbers and must total  transfers of existing account value you may also transfer your existing account value from one investment option to another to do so you must tell us how much to transfer either as a whole number percentage or as a specific dollar amount a confirmation of each transfer will be sent to you without our approval the maximum amount you may transfer to or from any investment option in any policy year is  under our current rules you can make transfers out of any variable investment option anytime you wish however we reserve the right to impose limits on the number and frequency of transfers into and out of variable investment options and to impose a charge of up to  for any transfer beyond an annual limit which will not be less than  transfers under the dollar cost averaging program would not be counted toward any such limit transfers out of the fixed investment option are currently subject to the following restrictions   you can only make such a transfer once in each policy year  any transfer request received within  months of the last transfer out of the fixed investment option will not be processed until such  month period has expired  the most you can transfer at any one time is the greater of i  ii  of the assets in your fixed investment option or iii the amount transferred out of your fixed investment option during the previous policy year we reserve the right to impose limits on the minimum amount of each transfer out of the fixed investment option and the maximum amount of any transfer into the fixed investment option after the second policy year dollar cost averaging this is a program of automatic monthly transfers out of the money market investment option into one or more of the other variable investment options you choose the investment options and the dollar amount and timing of the transfers the program is designed to reduce the risks that result from market fluctuations it does this by spreading out the allocation of your money to investment options over a longer period of time this allows you to reduce the risk of investing most of your money at a time when market prices are high obviously the success of this strategy depends on market trends and is not guaranteed scheduled transfers under this option may be made from the money market investment option to not more than nine other variable investment options however the amount transferred to any one investment option must be at least  once we receive the election in form satisfactory to us at our life servicing office transfers will begin on the second monthly deduction date following its receipt if you have any questions with respect to this provision call  once elected the scheduled monthly transfer option will remain in effect for so long as you have at least  of your account value in the money market investment option or until we receive written notice from you of cancellation of the option or notice of the death of the last surviving insured person the dollar cost averaging and rebalancing options cannot be in effect at the same time we reserve the right to modify terminate or suspend the dollar cost averaging program at any time surrender and partial withdrawals full surrender you may surrender your policy in full at any time if you do we will pay you the account value less any policy loans and less any cdsc charge that then applies this is called your surrender value you must return your policy when you request a full surrender we process surrenders as of the day we receive the surrender request partial withdrawals you may make a partial withdrawal of your surrender value at any time after the first policy year each partial withdrawal must be at least  there is a charge usually  for each partial withdrawal we will automatically reduce the account value of your policy by the amount of the withdrawal and the related charge unless we agree otherwise each investment option will be reduced in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated among them we will not permit a partial withdrawal if it would cause your surrender value to fall below  months worth of monthly charges see deductions from account value on page xx we also reserve the right to refuse any partial withdrawal that would cause the policys total sum insured to fall below  or the policys basic sum insured to fall below  under the option a death benefit the reduction of your account value occasioned by a partial withdrawal could cause the minimum insurance amount to become less than your total sum insured see how much will we pay when the insured person dies on page xx if that happens we will automatically reduce your total sum insured the calculation of that reduction is explained in the policy and will be implemented by first reducing any additional sum insured in effect if the reduction in total sum insured would cause your policy to fail the internal revenue codes definition of life insurance we will not permit the partial withdrawal if the withdrawal results in a reduction in basic sum insured a prorata portion of the applicable cdsc will be deducted from the account value see contingent deferred sales charge cdsc on page xx  policy loans you may borrow from your policy at any time by completing a form satisfactory to us or if the telephone transaction authorization form has been completed by telephone the maximum amount you can borrow is determined as follows  we first determine the surrender value of your policy  we then subtract an amount equal to  times the monthly charges then being deducted from account value  we then multiply the resulting amount by  in policy years  through   in policy years  through  and  thereafter although we reserve the right to increase the percentage after policy year  to as much as   we then subtract the third item above from the result of the second item above the minimum amount of each loan is  the interest charged on any loan is an effective annual rate of  in the first  policy years  in policy years  through  and  thereafter however we reserve the right to increase the percentage after policy year  to as much as  accrued interest will be added to the loan daily and will bear interest at the same rate as the original loan amount the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated among them and is placed in a special loan account this special loan account will earn interest at an effective annual rate of  however if we determine that a loan will be treated as a taxable distribution because of the differential between the loan interest rate and the rate being credited on the special loan account we reserve the right to decrease the rate credited on the special loan account to a rate that would in our reasonable judgement result in the transaction being treated as a loan under federal tax law we process policy loans as of the day we receive the loan request repayment of policy loans you can repay all or part of a loan at any time unless we agree otherwise each repayment will be allocated among the investment options as follows  the same proportionate part of the loan as was borrowed from the fixed investment option will be repaid to the fixed investment option  the remainder of the repayment will be allocated among the investment options in the same way a new premium payment would be allocated if you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment you must include instructions to that effect otherwise all payments will be assumed to be premium payments we process loan repayments as of the day we receive the repayment effects of policy loans the account value the surrender value and any death benefit above the total sum insured are permanently affected by any loan whether or not it is repaid in whole or in part this is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options and placed in a special loan account the investment options and the special loan account will generally have different rates of investment return the amount of the outstanding loan which includes accrued and unpaid interest is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable whenever the outstanding loan equals or exceeds the surrender value the policy will terminate  days after we have mailed notice of termination to you and to any assignee of record at such assignees last known address specifying the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within  that period also taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the policy may lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged on the loan and the interest rate credited to the special loan account policy loans may result in adverse tax consequences under certain circumstances see tax considerations beginning on page xx description of charges at the policy level deductions from premium payments  tax charge  a charge to cover state premium taxes we currently expect to pay on average and the increased federal income tax burden that we currently expect will result from receipt of premiums this charge is currently  of each premium  premium sales charge  a charge to help defray our sales costs the charge is  of the premium you pay in all policy years we currently intend to stop making this charge on premiums received after the th policy year but this is not guaranteed because policies of this type were first offered for sale in the year  no termination of this charge has yet occurred deductions from account value  issue charge  a monthly charge made for the first four policy years to help defray our sales and administrative costs part of the charge is a percentage of the target premium and will be the same regardless of the amount of premium actually paid the percentage will vary depending upon the proportion of additional sum insured at issue and will never be greater than  the target premium is determined at the time the policy is issued and appears in the policy specifications section of the policy in general the greater the proportion of additional sum insured at issue the lower the target premium the other part of the charge is an amount per thousand of basic sum insured at issue this amount will vary depending upon the proportion of additional sum insured at issue and will never be greater than c in general the greater the proportion of additional sum insured at issue the lower the amount per thousand  maintenance charge  a monthly charge to help defray our administrative costs this is a flat dollar charge of up to  currently  during all policy years  insurance charge  a monthly charge for the cost of insurance to determine the charge we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are at risk by a cost of insurance rate the rate is derived from an actuarial table and the ratio of basic sum insured to additional sum insured on the date we issue your policy the table in your policy will show the maximum cost of insurance rates the cost of insurance rates that we currently apply are generally less than the maximum rates we will review the cost of insurance rates at least every  years and may change them from time to time however those rates will never be more than the maximum rates shown in the policy the table of rates we use will depend on the insurance risk characteristics and usually gender of each of the insured persons the total sum insured and the length of time the policy has been in effect regardless of the table used cost of insurance rates generally increase each year that you own your policy as each insured persons attained age increases an insured persons attained age on any date is his or her age on the birthday nearest that date the insurance charge is not affected by the death of the first insured person to die the insurance charge for death benefit option b will tend to be higher than the insurance charge for death benefit option a see how much will we pay when the last insured person dies on page xx  extra mortality charge  a monthly charge specified in your policy for additional mortality risk if either of the insured persons is subject to certain types of special insurance risk  assetbased risk charge  a monthly charge for mortality and expense risks we assume the charge is a percentage of that portion of your account value allocated to variable investment options the current percentage on the first  of account value allocated to variable investment options is  we guarantee that this percentage will never exceed  the current percentages on the account value allocated to the variable investment options in excess of  are  for policy years  through   for policy years  through  and  for policy years  and thereafter we guarantee that these percentages will never exceed  for all policy years  this charge does not apply to the fixed investment option  optional benefits charge  monthly charges for certain optional insurance benefits added to the policy by means of a rider some of the riders we currently offer are described under can you add additional benefit riders on page xx   contingent deferred sales charge cdsc  a charge we deduct if the policy lapses or is surrendered within the first  policy years we deduct this charge to compensate us for sales expenses that we would otherwise not recover in the event of early lapse or surrender the charge is a percentage of the premiums we received in the first two policy years that do not exceed the first year target premium as shown in the following table policy years percentage of premiums received                              and later  the percentages may be lower for older issue ages due to certain state law restrictions a prorata portion of the cdsc may also be charged in the case of certain types of withdrawals see partial withdrawals on page xx  partial withdrawal charge  a  charge for each partial withdrawal of account value to compensate us for the administrative expenses of processing the withdrawal additional information about how certain policy charges work sales expenses and related charges the sales charges ie the premium sales charge and the cdsc help to compensate us for the cost of selling our policies see what charges will we deduct from your investment in the policy in the basic information section of this prospectus the amount of the charges in any policy year does not specifically correspond to sales expenses for that year we expect to recover our total sales expenses over the life of the policies to the extent that the sales charges do not cover total sales expenses the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources including gains from the assetbased risk charge and other gains with respect to the policies or from our general assets similarly administrative expenses not fully recovered by the issue charge and the maintenance charge may also be recovered from such other sources effect of premium payment pattern you may structure the timing of premium payments to minimize the sales charges although doing so involves certain risks paying less premium in the first  policy years and more in later years could reduce your total sales charges for example if  the target premium was  and you paid  in each of the first  policy years you would pay total sales charges of  and be subject to a maximum cdsc of  if you paid  in each of the first  policy years and  in policy year  you would pay total sales charges of only  and be subject to a maximum cdsc of only  however delaying the payment of premiums to later policy years could increase the risk that the guaranteed death benefit feature will not be in effect and the surrender value will be insufficient to pay policy charges as a result the policy or any additional sum insured may lapse and eventually terminate method of deduction unless we agree otherwise we will deduct the monthly charges described in the basic information section and any cdsc from your policys investment options in proportion to the amount of account value you have in each for each month that we cannot deduct any charge because of insufficient account value the uncollected charges will accumulate and be deducted when and if sufficient account value becomes available the insurance under the policy continues in full force during any grace period but if the last surviving insured person dies during the policy grace period the amount of unpaid monthly charges is deducted from the death benefit otherwise payable reduced charges for eligible classes the charges otherwise applicable may be reduced with respect to policies issued to a class of associated individuals or to a trustee employer or similar entity where we anticipate that the sales to the members of the class will result in lower than normal sales or administrative expenses lower taxes or lower risks to us we will make these reductions in accordance with our rules in effect at the time of the application for a policy the factors we consider in determining the eligibility of a particular group for reduced charges and the level of the reduction are as follows the nature of any association and its organizational framework the method by which sales will be made to the members of the class the facility with which premiums will be collected from any associated individuals and the associations capabilities with respect to administrative tasks the anticipated lapse and surrender rates of the policies the size of the class of associated individuals and the number of years it has been in existence the aggregate amount of premiums paid and any other such circumstances which result in a reduction in sales or administrative expenses lower taxes or lower risks any reduction in charges will be reasonable and will apply uniformly to all prospective policy purchasers in the class and will not unfairly discriminate against any owner other charges could we impose in the future except for the tax charge deducted from premium payments we currently make no charge for our federal income taxes however if we incur or expect to incur income taxes attributable to any subaccount of the account or this class of policies in future years we reserve the right to make a charge for such taxes any such charge would reduce what you earn on any affected investment options however we expect that no such charge will be necessary we also reserve the right to increase the tax charge in order to correspond respectively with changes in the state premium tax levels or in the federal income tax treatment of the deferred acquisition costs for this type of policy under current laws we may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws we may make charges for such taxes description of charges at the fund level the funds must pay investment management fees and other operating expenses these fees and expenses shown in the tables on pages xx and xx are different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund therefore they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable investment options you select we may also receive payments from a fund or its affiliates at an annual rate of up to approximately  of the average net assets that holders of our variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts have invested in that fund any such payments do not however result in any charge to you in addition to what is shown in the tables the figures for the funds shown in the tables on pages xx and xx are based on historical fund expenses as a percentage rounded to two decimal places of each funds average daily net assets for  except as indicated in the footnotes appearing  at the end of those tables expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified under the terms of the policy and those expenses may vary from year to year other policy benefits rights and limitations optional benefit riders you can add when you apply for a policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we then make available availability of any rider the benefits it provides and the charges for it may vary by state our rules and procedures will govern eligibility for any rider and in some cases the configuration of the actual rider benefits each rider contains specific details that you should review before you decide to choose the rider charges for most riders will be deducted from the policys account value we may change these charges or the rates that determine them but not above any applicable maximum amount stated in the policy specifications page of your policy policy split option rider at the time of policy issue you may elect a rider that will permit the total sum insured to be evenly split into two separate policies one for each insured person but only if the insured persons get divorced or certain federal tax law changes occur the rider may be cancelled at any time but it will automatically terminate on the date of death of the first insured person to die or on the policy anniversary nearest the older insured persons th birthday whichever is earlier a policy split could have adverse tax consequences so check with your tax adviser before electing this rider optional enhanced cash value rider if you surrender the policy at any time during the first  policy years and this rider is then in effect we will pay an enhanced cash value benefit the benefit is paid in addition to the policy surrender value the benefit is equal to a percentage of first year premiums paid up to the target premium the percentage will be specified in the policy also if you die during the first  policy years and the rider is in effect we will increase the policys account value by the amount of the benefit in determining the death benefit payable since the rider increases the amount of insurance for which we are at risk it increases the amount of the insurance charge described on page xx the maximum amount you may borrow from the policy or withdraw from the policy through partial withdrawals is not effected by this rider this rider can only be elected at the time of application for the policy other riders we currently offer a number of other optional riders such as the four year level term rider ask your jhvlico representative for details variations in policy terms insurance laws and regulations apply to us in every state in which our policies are sold as a result various terms and conditions of your insurance coverage may vary from the terms and conditions described in this prospectus depending upon where you reside these variations will be reflected in your policy or in endorsements attached to your policy we may vary the charges and other terms of our policies where special circumstances result in sales or administrative expenses mortality risks or other risks that are different from those normally associated with the policies these include the type of variations discussed under reduced charges for eligible classes on page xx no variation in any charge will exceed any maximum stated in this prospectus with respect to that charge any variation discussed above will be made only in accordance with uniform rules that we adopt and that we apply fairly to our customers  procedures for issuance of a policy generally the policy is available with a minimum basic sum insured at issue of  at the time of issue each insured person must have an attained age of at least  and no more than  all insured persons must meet certain health and other insurance risk criteria called underwriting standards policies issued in montana or in connection with certain employee plans will not directly reflect the sex of the insured persons in either the premium rates or the charges or values under the policy minimum initial premium the minimum initial premium must be received by us at our life servicing office in order for the policy to be in full force and effect there is no grace period for the payment of the minimum initial premium the minimum initial premium is determined by us based on the characteristics of each of the insured persons the basic sum insured and the additional sum insured at issue and the policy options you have selected commencement of insurance coverage after you apply for a policy it can sometimes take up to several weeks for us to gather and evaluate all the information we need to decide whether to issue a policy to you and if so what the insured persons rate classes should be after we approve an application for a policy and assign an appropriate insurance rate class we will prepare the policy for delivery we will not pay a death benefit under a policy unless the policy is in effect when the last surviving insured person dies except for the circumstances described under temporary insurance coverage prior to policy delivery on page xx the policy will take effect only if all of the following conditions are satisfied  the policy is delivered to and received by the applicant  the minimum initial premium is received by us  each insured person is living and still meets our health criteria for issuing insurance if all of the above conditions are satisfied the policy will take effect on the date shown in the policy as the date of issue that is the date on which we begin to deduct monthly charges policy months policy years and policy anniversaries are all measured from the date of issue backdating in order to preserve a younger age at issue for at least one of the insured persons we can designate a date of issue that is up to  days earlier than the date that would otherwise apply this is referred to as backdating and is allowed under state insurance laws backdating can also be used in certain corporateowned life insurance cases involving multiple policies to retain a common monthly deduction date the conditions for coverage described above under commencement of insurance coverage must still be satisfied but in a backdating situation the policy always takes effect retroactively backdating results in a lower insurance charge if it is used to preserve an insured persons younger age at issue but monthly charges begin earlier than would otherwise be the case those monthly charges will be deducted as soon as we receive premiums sufficient to pay them temporary coverage prior to policy delivery if a specified amount of premium is paid with the application for a policy and other conditions are met we will provide temporary survivorship term life insurance coverage on the insured persons for a period prior to the time coverage under the policy takes effect such temporary survivorship term coverage will be subject to the terms and conditions described in the application for the policy including limits on amount and duration of coverage monthly deduction dates each charge that we deduct monthly is assessed against your account value or the subaccounts at the close of business on the date of issue and at the close of the first business day in each subsequent policy month  changes that we can make as to your policy we reserve the right to make any changes in the policy necessary to ensure the policy is within the definition of life insurance under the federal tax laws and is in compliance with any changes in federal or state tax laws in our policies we reserve the right to make certain changes if they would serve the best interests of policy owners or would be appropriate in carrying out the purposes of the policies such changes include the following  changes necessary to comply with or obtain or continue exemptions under the federal securities laws  combining or removing investment options  changes in the form of organization of any separate account any such changes will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable laws and only in the manner permitted by such laws when required by law we will obtain your approval of the changes and the approval of any appropriate regulatory authority the owner of the policy who owns the policy thats up to the person who applies for the policy the owner of the policy is the person who can exercise most of the rights under the policy such as the right to choose the investment options or the right to surrender the policy in many cases the person buying the policy is also the person who will be the owner however the application for a policy can name another person or entity such as a trust as owner whenever weve used the term you in this prospectus weve assumed that the reader is the person who has whatever right or privilege is being discussed there may be tax consequences if the owner and the insured person are different so you should discuss this issue with your tax adviser while either of the insured persons is alive you will have a number of options under the policy here are some major ones  determine when and how much you invest in the various investment options  borrow or withdraw amounts you have in the investment options  change the beneficiary who will receive the death benefit  change the amount of insurance  turn in ie surrender the policy for the full amount of its surrender value  choose the form in which we will pay out the death benefit or other proceeds it is possible to name socalled joint owners of the policy if more than one person owns a policy all owners must join in most requests to exercise rights under the policy policy cancellation right you have the right to cancel your policy within  days after you receive it the period may be longer in some states this is often referred to as the free look period to cancel your policy simply deliver or mail the policy to  jhvlico at one of the addresses shown on the back cover of this prospectus or  the jhvlico representative who delivered the policy to you in most states you will receive a refund of any premiums youve paid in some states the refund will be your account value on the date of cancellation plus all charges deducted by jhvlico or the series funds prior to that date the date of cancellation will be the date of such mailing or delivery reports that you will receive at least annually we will send you a statement setting forth the following information as of the end of the most recent reporting period the amount of the death benefit the basic sum insured and the additional sum insured the account value the portion of the account value in each investment option the surrender value premiums received and charges deducted from  premiums since the last report and any outstanding policy loan and interest charged for the preceding policy year moreover you also will receive confirmations of premium payments transfers among investment options policy loans partial withdrawals and certain other policy transactions semiannually we will send you a report containing the financial statements of each series fund including a list of securities held in each fund assigning your policy you may assign your rights in the policy to someone else as collateral for a loan or for some other reason assignments do not require the consent of any revocable beneficiary a copy of the assignment must be forwarded to us we are not responsible for any payment we make or any action we take before we receive notice of the assignment in good order nor are we responsible for the validity of the assignment an absolute assignment is a change of ownership all collateral assignees of record must consent to any full surrender partial withdrawal or loan from the policy when we pay policy proceeds general we will pay any death benefit withdrawal surrender value or loan within  days after we receive the last required form or request and with respect to the death benefit any other documentation that may be required if we dont have information about the desired manner of payment within  days after the

respect to any class of such policies  tax considerations this description of federal income tax consequences is only a brief summary and is not intended as tax advice tax consequences will vary based on your own particular circumstances and for further information you should consult a qualified tax advisor federal state and local tax laws regulations and interpretations can change from time to time as a result the tax consequences to you and the beneficiary may be altered in some cases retroactively general generally death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not subject to income tax earnings on your account value are not subject to income tax as long as we dont pay them out to you if we do pay out any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal all or part of that distribution should generally be treated as a return of the premiums youve paid and should not be subject to income tax amounts you borrow are generally not taxable to you however some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a modified endowment contract this can happen if youve paid more than a certain amount of premiums that is prescribed by the tax laws additional taxes and penalties may be payable for policy distributions of any kind policy proceeds we believe the policy will receive the same federal income and estate tax treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies section  of the internal revenue code the code defines a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes if certain standards are met at issue and over the life of the policy the policy will satisfy that definition we will monitor compliance with these standards if the policy complies with section  we believe the death benefit proceeds under the policy will be excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section  of the code in addition if you have elected the longterm care acceleration rider the riders benefits generally will be excludable from gross income under the code the taxfree nature of these accelerated benefits is contingent on the rider meeting specific requirements under sections  andor section b of the code we have designed the rider to meet these standards other policy distributions increases in account value as a result of interest or investment experience will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are actually received through distributions in general the owner will be taxed on the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy but under certain circumstances within the first  policy years the owner may be taxed on a distribution even if total withdrawals do not exceed total premiums paid any taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner rather than capital gains distributions for tax purposes can include amounts received upon surrender or partial withdrawals you may also be deemed to have received a distribution for tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your policys ownership if you have elected the longterm care acceleration rider as described beginning on page xx you may be deemed to have received a distribution for tax purposes each time a deduction is made from your policys account value to pay the rider charge we also believe that except as noted below loans received under the policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will constitute income to the owner however if the policy terminates for any reason the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such termination this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans you might find yourself having to choose between high premiums requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur it is possible that despite our monitoring a policy might fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the code this could happen for example if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium payments that were in excess of permitted amounts or if any of the funds failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements of the code if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to the policy for the period of the disqualification and for subsequent periods  tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary because there may be unfavorable tax consequences including recognition of taxable income and the loss of income taxfree treatment for any death benefit payable to the beneficiary you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to changing the policys ownership or making any assignment of ownership interests diversification rules and ownership of the account your policy will not qualify for the tax benefit of a life insurance contract unless the account follows certain rules requiring diversification of investments underlying the policy in addition the rules require that the policy owner not have investment control over the underlying assets the treasury department explained in its temporary regulations regarding diversification that such regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account as the variable policy owner you will be treated as the owner of account assets if you have the ability to exercise investment control over them if you are found to have such ability you will be taxed on any income or gains the assets generate although the treasury department announced several years ago that it would provide further guidance on this issue it had not yet done so as of the date of this prospectus the ownership rights under your policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described in internal revenue service rulings in which it was determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account assets since you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was the case in those rulings it is possible that you would be treated as the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account we do not know what will be in future treasury department regulations or other guidance we cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to operate as currently described in the series funds prospectuses or that a series fund will not have to change any funds investment objectives or policies we have reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe it will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account but we are under no obligation to do so pay premium limit at the time of policy issuance we will determine whether the planned premium schedule will exceed the pay limit discussed below if so our standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form acknowledging that fact the pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully paidup after the payment of  equal annual premiums paidup means that no further premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity based on certain prescribed assumptions if the total premiums paid at any time during the first  policy years exceed the pay limit the policy will be treated as a modified endowment which can have adverse tax consequences the owner will be taxed on distributions and loans from a modified endowment to the extent of any income gain to the owner on an incomefirst basis the distributions and loans affected will be those made on or after and within the two year period prior to the time the policy becomes a modified endowment additionally a  penalty tax may be imposed on taxable portions of such distributions or loans that are made before the owner attains age   furthermore any time there is a material change in a policy generally the result of such things as an increase in the additional sum insured the addition of certain other policy benefits after issue a change in death benefit option or reinstatement of a lapsed policy the policy will have a new pay limit as if it were a newlyissued policy if a prescribed portion of the policys then account value plus all other premiums paid within  years after the material change at any time exceed the new pay limit the policy will become a modified endowment moreover if benefits under a policy are reduced such as a reduction in the total sum insured or death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits during the  years in which a pay test is being applied the pay limit will  generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits if the premiums paid to date are greater than the recalculated pay limit the policy will become a modified endowment all modified endowments issued by the same insurer or its affiliates to the owner during any calendar year generally are required to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified endowment rules a policy received in exchange for a modified endowment will itself also be a modified endowment you should consult your tax advisor if you have questions regarding the possible impact of the pay limit on your policy corporate and hr  plans the policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement plans satisfying the qualification requirements of section  of the code if so the code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits thereunder should be carefully scrutinized we are not responsible for compliance with the terms of any such plan or with the requirements of applicable provisions of the
