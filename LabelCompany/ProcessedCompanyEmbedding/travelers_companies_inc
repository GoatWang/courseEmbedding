long only value insurance midcapsummarytravelers inc is one of the largest pc insurers in the usas some others insurers eg aflac cincinnati financial travelers inc rewards very well its shareholders by increasing every year its dividend and by repurchasing its shareshowever the underwriting performance is declining over the years the q  results proved again that the operating performance continues deterioratingthe company remains a good choice for a dividend seeker even if the insurer is currently slightly overvaluednotes for the readers most of the figures are based on the financial reports of travelers inc nysetrv and of its main competitors executive summary travelers inc is a usbased property and casualty insurance company which is one of the largest insurers in the country the share price has reached a new week high and should continue climbing while q  results were not excellent showing the downward trend of the underwriting performance of the companys portfolio even if the insurer has outperformed its peers in the past the question of the undervaluation should be raised to answer the question that every investor asks himherself  should i invest in this stock regarding my investor profile  we need to analyze the historical results of the company look on its underwriting track record its capital redistribution its commercial performance to determine if it is worth to invest in it history of the group the origins of travelers go back to the th century the travelers companies is created by the merger of two companies saint paul fire and marine insurance co and travelers saint paul fire and marine insurance co was founded march   in st paul minnesota by alexander wilkin secretary of the minnesota territory and  other businesspeople in  jg batterson and nine other entrepreneurs found the travelers insurance company after one century of expansion saint paul fire and marine insurance co formed in  the st paul companies inc and acquired in  st katerine insurance company a londonbased insurer in  the travelers indemnity company and the aetna casualty and surety company merged to form the us fourth largest pc insurer two years later the st paul acquired united states fidelity and guaranty company a baltimorebased insurer and became the eighth largest pc insurer in the united states the same year the travelers group merged with citicorp to form citigroup nysec in  citigroups management considering the synergies between the bank and insurance activities were not sufficient enough decided to spinoff travelers property and casualty into a subsidiary company citigroup ended travelers business adventure by selling the travelers life  annuity to metlife nysemet in  the st paul and travelers merged to form the st paul travelers companies three years later the company changed its name to the travelers companies inc and repurchased the rights to the famous red umbrella logo from citigroup in  travelers acquired through its canadian subsidiary the dominion of canada general insurance company in  travelers acquired the majority interest in the business of its j malucelli joint venture in brazil the travelers in  with  net written premiums of  billion travelers inc is a general business holding company which operates mainly in the united states  of the  revenues and canada  of the  revenues the company provides a broad range of commercial and personal pc insurance products and services to businesses government units associations and individuals travelers inc groups its operations into three business segments source travelers financial document business  international insurance which posted  billion in revenues last year through its segment travelers inc offers a broad array of pc products to its clients its main lines of business are workers compensation commercial automobile commercial property general liability commercial multiperil and international the products under business  international insurance segments are distributed through approximately  independent agencies and brokers the client target is the midsized businesses as they represented  of the total revenues of this segment bond  specialty insurance which generated  billion in revenues in  travelers inc writes mainly fidelity  surety policies and general liability insurance coverage personal insurance with  billion in revenues in  personal insurance products are marketed and distributed through  independent agencies the two product lines sold through this segment are automobile insurance products and homeowners insurance products competitive position a leading player in the us pc insurance market the travelers companies inc is a leading provider of property casualty insurance for auto home and business hence it has a leading position in both commercial and personal insurance lines of business in commercial insurance it holds the no  position in personal insurance segment the insurer is the thirdlargest insurance company in the us with a  annualized growth rate from  travelers inc is not a fast growing company but is neither a declining one source travelers financial document the growth in the turnover is mainly driven by the business and internal insurance segment which is the largest business segments of the company from  to  the net written premiums grew by  to  billion source travelers financial document mainly present in the us the international segment representing only  of the total new written business the commercial insurance portfolio of the usbased insurer is welldiversified regarding the types of products source travelers financial document however its leading position does not prevent travelers against price competitions the increase in the catastrophe losses and the deterioration of its operating profitability source travelers financial document even if the net written premiums grew over the years the deterioration of the combined ratio eroded the commercial development efforts done during the last four years the degradation of the operating performance in the commercial business could also be observed in the personal insurance business with  billion of revenues in  this segment has followed the same upward trend regarding commercial development the net premiums increased by  from  to  but the income was more erratic than the revenue growth mainly due to higher volatility regarding claims development source travelers financial document the erratic movement of the portfolio profitability could be partially explained by the structure of it with automobile and homeowner insurance products in its personal portfolio travelers should face to an intense competition with the other insurers which are sometimes only present in some states in the us and then have higher competitive advantages than travelers in spite of its leading position regarding its premium volume source travelers financial document last but not least the surety portfolio is tiny compared to the two others only  billion of revenues in  source travelers financial document the portfolio is split into two lines of business the surety insurance portfolio which represented in   of the net premiums written for this segment and the management liability insurance portfolio which is mainly focused on the small and the middle markets source travelers financial document as surety and management insurance businesses are niche markets it is harder for travelers to have the same commercial development than for its traditional markets however there is low pressure on the prices and it is easier with a strong underwriting process to deliver a higher profitability than in the motor insurance which is a less tailoredinsurance market than the surety business hence the income level in this segment is more stable and less volatile with a lower combined ratio often positively impacted by favorable claims development for the prior years source travelers financial document travelers inc remains a mature insurer in the us with a substantial market position in both commercial and personal segments even if the growth in the revenues was higher in q  than the one observed during the last year the investors could not expect the pc company to increase its operating revenues by  or  per year furthermore the investors should not be dazzled by the positive commercial development observed during the first quarter of  an insurer does not make money by writing more premiums an insurance company makes money by only two means it invests very efficiently the premiums paid by its policyholders or its writes more premiums than it pays claims in travelers case investment income declined modestly in q  following the downward spiral of the fixedincome portfolio and the combined ratio deteriorated hence the investors should not be too optimistic regarding the revenue increase or should rather concentrate on the evolution of the portfolio both commercial portfolio and investment portfolio profitability operating performance a strong but declining performance the main obvious metric for a pc insurer is the combined ratio it could be difficult to compare two different pc insurers if the market is completely different but it is the simplest and the most straightforward metric to say at least if a pc insurer is profitable or not in travelers case the answer is simple the company is profitable in all segments for many years it is mainly due to a strong underwriting discipline coupled with a leading position in its markets source travelers financial document with an average combined ratio of around  any insurance professional could say that travelers incs underwriting performance is very high generally speaking the longterm combined ratio target is rather around  nordic european insurers eg gjensidige otcgjnsf otcpkgjnsy topdanmark otcpktpdky sampo otcpksaxpy otcpksaxpf and niche insurers credit insurers some reinsurers other insurers as aflac nyseafl atlas nasdaqafh and kingstone companies nasdaqkins are able to reach this target on a longterm horizon for the majority of the insurance company  combined ratio is the holy grail of the underwriting performance however the profitability of the insurance portfolio of travelers inc is slightly declining over the years the worst deterioration of the profitability is related to the personal insurance portfolio from  to  the combined ratio rose by  percentage points to   was also worrisome because the reserve development of the prior years was unfavorable in a traditional insurance company the process is the following actuaries calculate an ultimate claim amount per attachment year based on the claims triangles paid or incurred in most of the cases the actuaries slightly overreserve to be more conservative thats why every year the company could release a reserve amount related to prior years the reserving process depends primarily on the managements strategy some insurers could be more aggressive than others regarding their reserving process going back to travelers the insurer has proven in the past that it was prudent regarding the claims and reserve assessment a negative runoff should mean that the situation deteriorated more than expected and we could also see that in q  the impact of the catastrophe events increased an additional  percentage point impact on the combined ratio than in q  and there was no reserve release related to the prior years source travelers financial document yet all is not doom and gloom even if the commercial insurance portfolio profitability declined as well from  the situation in  was more than good however the situation deteriorated slightly in q  with a combined ratio of  source travelers financial document furthermore the bond  specialty portfolio remains very profitable with an average combined ratio lower than  as for the rest of the portfolio  did not start well the portfolio delivering less runoff than last year mainly due to the aoi experience as mentioned during the q  conference call source travelers financial document as for the operating performance the investment performance is slightly declining but the reason is completely explainable with  of bond and shortterm securities and aa average credit rating it is tough for an insurer to deliver an excellent performance in a lowinterest rate environment source travelers financial document thats why the contribution of the financial income in the roe dropped over the years except in q  mainly driven by higher private equity returns as the largest part of the portfolio is invested in fixedincome instruments a gradual increase in the interest rates would improve the profitability of the investment portfolio source travelers financial document going back to the roe question even if it has decreased over the years mainly impacted by the operating performance deterioration and lowinterest rate environment the level of the roe is higher than of its peers source travelers financial document in other words travelers inc remains more profitable than its competitors on an average basis because of a solid operating performance and a smaller impact of the lowinterest rate environment unlike the life insurers regarding the track record of travelers inc we could expect the company to continue delivering strong underwriting results  could be more challenging than the previous years however if the company succeeds to reprice its policies and reduces the impact of the catastrophe events investors could have a good surprise nevertheless they should remain prudent look at the trend and do not mistake their dreams for reality stock repurchase program and dividend nothing to say it is terrific we could say that travelers inc is not a growing company we could add that the profitability of the firm is lower than in the past and quite disappointing if not worrisome but no one could have the nerve to say that travelers inc is a nonrewarding listed insurer every longterm shareholder has been rewarded for its patience its investment and its trust in the companys strategy with a  annualized growth of the paid dividend from  we could say that travelers inc rewarded the efforts of its shareholders source travelers financial document hence the dividend paid on a quarterly basis per share increased by  to reach  per share in  in other words it has more than doubled in  years not so bad furthermore the company also repurchased its shares year after year increasing mechanically the dividend received by the shareholders by paying cash dividends without interruption for  years travelers inc could consider as a good choice for a dividend seeker with a low payout ratio around  investors could continue being confident in the gradual increase in the cash dividend stock valuation a valuable slightly overvalued company sometimes we should talk about money any investors even the dividend seekers should know if the intrinsic value is lower or higher than the current market price so lets discuss valuation to assess the intrinsic value of travelers inc we used an approach based on the following valuation methods historical ratios pe pricesales and pricebook valuation multiple pe and pricebook as a peer review we have chosen the following companies progressive nysepgr allstate nyseall arch capital nasdaqarcc old republic international corporation nyseori hartford financial services nysehig chubb nysecb and cincinnati financial corporation nasdaqcinf dcf valuation we decided to model six scenarios with a discount rate of  from an external point view this level of the discount rate could be seen as assessed arbitrary it has been done at least partially and could be criticized  based on eps three scenarios best base and worst  best  annual growth for the next fifteen years the terminal growth rate is  in this scenario we consider that travelers inc would continue to repurchase its own shares actively and improve its operating profitability  base a  annual growth for the next fifteen years the terminal growth rate is  in this scenario we consider that travelers inc would continue to repurchase its own shares actively and maintain its operating profitability  worst a  annual growth for the next fifteen years the terminal growth rate is  in this scenario we consider that operating profitability would deteriorate and would be only offset by an active stock repurchase program  based on dps three scenarios best base and worst  best a  annual growth based on year average increase  base a  annual growth based on the year average increase  worst a  annual growth the company seems to be slightly overvalued at the current price however we would like to mention something with the ddm the output is very sensitive to the inputs hence changing the annual growth of the dividend and above all the discount rate could modify the results completely however we prefer keeping our assumptions and giving a valuation range rather than an absolute amount therefore the intrinsic value per share is between  and  in our view the company remains overvalued conclusion slightly overvalued at the moment travelers inc remains a very profitable insurance company which is facing to difficulties to maintain its historical level of profitability however it is a welldiversified company which both increases its dividend and repurchases its shares year after year a lazy dividend seeker who is not interested in any valuation consideration should have this stock in hisher portfolio an investor more focused on some riskreward metrics could have a look at other insurance companies more undervalued than the newyorkheadquartered pc company notes for the readers

difficult business environment they downsized the company substantially over the coming years by selling certain business units to focus on more profitable business units travelers was founded in  in hartford it was founded to provide travel insurance to railroad travelers at a time when travel was far more risky and dangerous than today hence the name along the way it had many industry firsts including the first automobile policy the first commercial airline policy and the first policy for space travel by the early s travelers was predominantly a general property and casualty insurer that also happened to do some travel insurance on the side and it quietly exited its original business in  what was left of travelers travel insurance business was acquired by three former employees and is now known as travel insured international the travelers logo ca  in the s it went through a series of mergers and acquisitions it was bought by primerica in  but the resulting company retained the travelers name in  it became the travelers group it bought aetnas property and casualty business in  in  the travelers group merged with citicorp to form citigroup however the synergies between the banking and insurance arms of the company did not work as well as planned so citigroup spun off travelers property and casualty into a subsidiary company in  although it kept the red umbrella logo

umbrella logo from citigroup and readopted it as its main corporate symbol while also changing the corporate name to the travelers companies many of travelers ancestor companies such as st paul and usfg are technically still around today and still write policies and accept claims in their own names under the overarching travelers brand name as is typical of most insurers in the united states travelers never dissolved the various companies it acquired but simply made them wholly owned subsidiaries and trained its employees to act on behalf of those subsidiaries this is a common risk management strategy used by us insurance groups if any one company in the group gets hit with too many claims the situation can be easily contained to that one company which is placed in runoff and allowed to run its policies to completion while the remainder of the group continues to operate normally in november  travelers entered into a joint venture agreement under which the company would
