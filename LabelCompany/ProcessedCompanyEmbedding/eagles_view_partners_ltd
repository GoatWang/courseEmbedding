began developing the methodology for georeferenced oblique aerial images  – steve schultz became first employee of newly incorporated pictometry inc in rochester ny  – pictometry international corp established in rochester ny  – first pictometry imagery captured in arlington county va and later used after  attacks on pentagon  – dave carlson and chris pershing began collaboration to create new remote roof measurement technology  – eagleview technologies founded in bothell wa  – pictometry international corp merged with eagleview technologies  – eagleview led formation of property drone consortium  – eagleview acquired by vista equity partners  – eagleview partnered with spookfish an australian company specializing in highresolution aerial image capture  – pictometry and eagleview technologies consolidated under one corporate brand eagleview  – eagleview acquired omniearth a developer of machine learning technologies and decisionmaking tools for the insurance water resource management and energy markets   how it all began georeferencing oblique imagery in the late s while capturing streetside imagery of every parcel in rochester ny rochester institute of technology rit professor john ciampa had an idea why not photograph buildings obliquely from the air and georeference the images to identify parcels there was only one issue the industry was almost exclusively looking straight down when capturing aerial imagery any oblique photographs captured then were just that photographs after obtaining a patent on the methodology in  ciampa turned to steve schultz a former student and colleague from rit to turn it into reality schultz worked parttime to validate the concept and in january  became employee number one of the newly incorporated pictometry inc for the next four years schultz refined the algorithms created the initial hardware operated the capture systems and developed the first working prototypes early adopters to turn the technology into a product the company hired richard kaplan as ceo in the fall of  seeing potential use for the imagery in county and municipal governments kaplan worked with schultz in  to demonstrate the product in counties throughout the united states the pair quickly found five early adopters monroe county ny ontario county ny arlington county va lee county fl and orange county ca schultz and his team of four software engineers now had six months to turn the working prototype into a fully functional system pictometry captured its first imagery in spring  and delivered its first complete library to arlington county va the arlington county fire department later used the imagery during the response to the september  attacks on the pentagon pictometry also flew ground zero to help in the search rescue and recovery efforts to let users view interact with and extract data from the imagery pictometry created electronic field study efs this unique desktop application allowed users to measure distances and heights from a single image surpassing the industry standard of the time that required two or more overlapping images to extract vertical measurements growth and success with the company growing at a rapid pace schultz turned to a former rit colleague frank giuffrida to help the business scale together they created the new pictometry capture systems that would collect oblique imagery from all four cardinal directions as well as nadir with a customer base doubling in size annually the business went from capturing imagery with six planes to using  aircraft in just a few short years by then the patented pictometry oblique camera systems became the first and only ones to receive us geological survey certification in  the company launched pictometryonline allowing users to view and interact with their imagery via a web browser by that time county customers had found more uses for pictometry imagery call takers in enhanced  call centers were using the imagery to pinpoint caller locations and identify nearby landmarks assessors began to do more work than ever before from their desks and found they could use the imagery to reduce the number of costly appeals a better way to measure meanwhile across the country two creative brothersinlaw were solving a different set of problems that would later result in the establishment of eagleview technologies dave carlson who was working in southern california as a roofing contractor and chris pershing a software engineer in seattle wanted to find a better process to measure roofs safely and accurately in addition to sharing a family relationship both carlson and pershing shared something else a passion for solving problems and continually asking “is there a better way” as they discussed the challenges of accurately measuring roofs they began researching to see if simple accurate technology was available for determining roof measurements when they discovered that software did not exist they began collaborating on ways to create new technology to produce remote roof measurements from aerial photographs pershing started by using his wife’s ornamental birdhouses as models to prototype software that would create a d model of roofs using photographs pershing refined the prototypes using feedback from carlson’s field experience and measurements taken on actual roofs several months later pershing and carlson had created and filed a patent for their extremely accurate software the industry standard in property measurements eagleview technologies was launched in february  as the first remote aerial roof measurement service in history creating d models designed to produce highly accurate and detailed roof and wall measurements the idea immediately caught on with roofing contractors throughout the country as they recognized the time savings safety benefits and increased job closing rates they received using eagleview property measurement reports insurance companies and adjusters were soon embracing eagleview as they too saw the benefits to an accurate thirdparty report in the event of a claim by the time eagleview was less than a year old it had become the industry standard in aerial roof measurements   eagleview today in  pictometry merged with eagleview technologies creating a business focused on developing progressive technology to automate manual activities across industries by then the business had launched the connect™ platform which includes the connectexplorer™ application this cloudbased software solution offers the functionality and benefits of the efs desktop solution remotely through a web browser further innovations over the following years included photorealistic d models change detection technology and interior mapping and modeling solutions vista equity partners purchased eagleview in  the following year eagleview partnered with australian company spookfish to capture higherresolution imagery on a more frequent basis in the us and expand internationally later in  eagleview made its first acquisition omniearth a leading provider of property data analytics derived from machine learning and aerial imagery while consolidating the business under the eagleview brand in  eagleview president rishi daga became leader of the business the former executive vice president of commercial sales daga has been with eagleview since shortly after its establishment in  frank giuffrida who developed the pictometry image capture systems also continues to lead and innovate at eagleview in his role as executive vice president and chief engineer over the years eagleview has produced more than  million images and covered more than  of the most populated areas in the united states altogether more than  cities counties and municipalities rely on
