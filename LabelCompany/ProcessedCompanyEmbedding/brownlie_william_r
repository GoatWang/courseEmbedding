depth and sediment discharge in open channels by william r brownlie  edition published in  in undetermined and held by  worldcat member library worldwide in recent years attempts have been made to develop numerical models for unsteady flows in channels with sediment transport this work was conducted to analyze two essential ingredients of any numerical model the relationship between the hydraulic variables slope depth and velocity and the predictor of sediment concentration a data base containing  records  laboratory records and  field records in  data files was assembled and is provided appendix b the data base was used to examine existing relationships and to develop new ones six existing hydraulic relationships are reworked and examined detailed statistical analyses are provided for  existing techniques for predicting sediment concentration relying heavily on statistical analysis of dimensionless groups new relationships have been developed the new hydraulic relationship solves for flow depth for upper and lower regime flow separately and then provides a method for determining which flow regime one might expect the new method for predicting sediment transport which is easy to use appears to be more accurate than the  existing methods and suggests that complex procedures for calculating concentration are not warranted a fourpoint implicit finite difference scheme has been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the new hydraulic and sediment relationships to a numerical solution of the differential equations   more fewer audience
