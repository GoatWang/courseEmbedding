bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk liquidity risk call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss there is an options regulatory fee from  to  per contract which applies to both option buy and sell transactions the fee is subject to change stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company industry political regulatory market or economic developments investing in stock involves risks including the loss of principal because of their narrow focus sector investments

for funds or star rating is calculated for funds with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the morningstar rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics ratings may vary by share class ratings andor rankings may be based in part on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by janus henderson methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the ratingranking when an expense waiver is in effect it may have a material effect on the total return or yield and therefore the ranking andor rating for the period the morningstar equity style box™ reveals a funds investment strategy for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth the morningstar fixedincome style box™ reveals a funds investment style as of the date noted for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros for a list of all nrsros please visit httpswwwsecgovocrratingagencyhtml additionally morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies if two rating organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the lower rating if three or more organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the median rating and in cases where there are more than two organizationagency ratings and a median rating does not exist fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings please note morningstar inc is not itself a nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund a nrsro or rating agency ratings can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive the morningstar analyst rating is not a credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by morningstar’s analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstar’s global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a fund with a “gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction a fund with a ‘silver’ rating has notable advantages across several but perhaps not all of the five pillarsstrengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction a “bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating a fund with a “neutral” rating isnt seriously flawed across the five pillars nor does it distinguish itself very positively a “negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers analyst ratings are reevaluated every  months for more detailed information about morningstar’s analyst rating including its methodology please go to httpcorporatemorningstarcomusdocumentsmethodologydocumentsanalystratingforfundsmethodologypdf the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings are based on morningstar’s current expectations about future events therefore in no way does morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected

the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of
