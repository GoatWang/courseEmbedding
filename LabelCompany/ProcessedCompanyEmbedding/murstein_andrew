corporation new york lizards peter schwartz new york lizards logo credit new york lizards new york lizards logo credit new york lizards by peter schwartz » more columns andrew murstein was a big sports fan growing up on long island but he wanted to be more than just a cheering spectator while many sports fans wonder what it would be like to own a professional sports franchise it was more than just a dream for murstein it was one of his missions in life “i had three business goals growing up” said murstein “one was to own a sports team one was to own a bank and the third was to get involved in politics so we’ve accomplished two of the three” the only thing that murstein has left on his todo list is politics andrew murstein credit new york lizards in  murstein’s family founded medallion funding corporation a company that has lent over  billion to the taxi industry then in  murstein launched medallion financial corporation a company that owns and leases several hundred taxi medallions while financing the purchase of thousands more murstein entered the sports business in  when he joined the nascar world spearheading a group that purchased richard petty motorsports the group currently has two cars in the sprint cup series and one in the nationwide series then in  murstein and a group of investors including pro football hall of famer jim brown bought the long island lizards of major league lacrosse murstein started looking at sports ownership about  years ago while taxi medallions are very profitable he came to realize that sports franchises are not he had a chance to buy some teams but didn’t pull the trigger because the numbers didn’t add up he was always determined to buy a team but it had to make sense long before he purchased the lizards murstein was in negotiations to buy the arena football league’s new york dragons but after taking a good look at the economics murstein and company decided not to buy the team “in the sports world if an owner wants to sell there’s usually a reason behind it” said murstein “in the dragons’ case the more we looked at it the worse the economics looked so we did not go forward” murstein made a great decision not long after that the dragons and the arena football league went out of business in  murstein and his group raised  million for a sports fund they looked at several clubs that were up for sale and submitted offers to buy the montreal canadiens and chicago cubs his quest for a sports franchise came to fruition when he acquired the lizards murstein is banking no pun intended on the potential of one of the fastestgrowing sports in the united states new york lizards logo credit new york lizards “it’s a great family sport” said murstein “they’re really good guys in other sports you have issues with guys carrying guns into clubs and drugs and here these are princeton yale johns hopkins …really bright guys they do it for the love of the sport” they are clearly not doing it for the money because the average salary for a lizards player is  they work another job during the week and then they play for the lizards on the weekends from a business standpoint lacrosse bears a strong resemblance to minor league baseball “it’s an inexpensive sport to attend” said murstein “it’s something that has a lot of upside because a lot of the media stations are looking for additional programming we figured that over time this will be attractive to them” murstein’s investment in the lizards could see another big payoff a year from now with the islanders departing nassau county for barclays center in brooklyn the lizards could reap the benefits in terms of sponsorships from long islandbased companies “from a business standpoint it’s great for us” said murstein “we’re going after a lot of their fan base now for season tickets and we’re going after a lot of their sponsors once they leave” for murstein owning a team has been onthejob training at the world series  years ago murstein picked the brain of mlb commissioner bud selig in the event that he would one day own a team “his advice was ‘once you own a team do nothing for the first year or two until you learn it and then start making decisions” said murstein shortly after buying the lizards who play their home games at shuart stadium at hofstra university on long island he didn’t listen to selig’s advice in an attempt to expand the team’s fan base murstein decided to move some of the home games to icahn stadium on randall’s island for the  season the name of the team was also changed from the long island lizards to the new york lizards “it backfired” said murstein of his decision to move games west “new york city has a lot more people but they have way too many options long island’s fan base for lacrosse is really east of nassau county not west” so this year the lizards will play exclusively on long island hofstra will host six of the seven home games including their april  home opener against the rochester rattlers the team will also head east for one home game on july  at lavalle stadium on the campus of stony brook university when attending a lizards home game don’t be surprised if you see the owner walking around murstein wants to make sure that the fans have a quality experience so he takes a look at things like the lines at will call and for food if they’re too long he’ll call people on his staff to correct the problem “i try to make sure everything clicks right for the consumer” said murstein it should be an enjoyable season for lizards fans the squad includes multiple winners of the tewaaraton trophy which is the collegelacrosse equivalent of the heisman among their top players are long islanders max seibald and rob pannell who is the alltime leading scorer in the history of college lacrosse the lizards also traded for ned crotty who was an allamerican at duke where he won a national championship “i think we’ve got a great team this year” said murstein who sounds like he has a little george steinbrenner in him “the goal as a yankees fan growing up was to emulate the star power of the yankees here immediately i said to the coach joe spallina that he could spend as much as you want and get us the best talent possible we want the superstars to play here it’s good for us it’s good for the league” so what kind of owner is murstein while he appreciates the passion that “the boss” had he’s not about to tell his lacrosse people what to do “i will never make a recommendation to them to make a trade or to go after somebody” said murstein “all the decisions really get left to the people that know what they’re doing and that’s not me” now there’s a good business decision made by a good businessman with decisions like that it wouldn’t be surprising to see murstein standing on a podium in atlanta on august  accepting a trophy after the lizards just won the mll championship game it also won’t be shocking if murstein winds up owning a team from the four major sports i can think of a few teams that can certainly benefit from his passion and decisionmaking you may also be interested in these stories yankees beat mariners win first

links early life and careeredit andrew mead murstein was born in roslyn new york to alvin and aileen murstein his grandfather of german descent leon murstein came to the united states from argentina became a new york cabdriver and purchased one of the first new york taxi medallions issued in  for  the family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as  each—medallions peaked at over  each and currently sell for around  each murstein reportedly sold the majority of his medallions in  and  before uber and lyft affected the taxi medallion values a claim that has not been independently verified a subsidiary of medallion financial currently owns  chicago medallions it values at  each or approximately  million but owes more than  million on them the subsidiary is currently being sued in a new york court for failing to repay a loan on the chicago medallions murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early his father employed by his grandfather in his queensbased taxi business used to take young andrew along to the taxi garage where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late today murstein does not travel by taxi instead relying on a private driver paid for by medallion financial since  andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than  medallions when they decided to sell some in the s no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky they did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion medallion has since lent over  billion to the taxi industry but has chargedoff at least  million in medallion loans in  aloneaccording to regulatory filings regulators required medallion bank to take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended september   after a recent examination after increasing reserves medallion bank was undercapitalized in  the mursteins founded a familyowned company called medallion funding corp to build a taxi medallion lending business medallion funding earned returns on investment over  percent per year more recently medallion funding corp and its subsidiaries were sued in a new york court for failure to repay  million borrowed to finance chicago medallions that are currently underwater as recently as march  senior notes issued by medallion financial traded for just  of par value a level that is indicative of severe financial distress later life and careeredit andrew murstein after completing his studies at tufts university and new york university spent several years on wall street including a stop at salomon brothers where he learned the power of equity in funding a business he joined medallion funding fulltime in  and eventually took the company public in  murstein successfully launched medallion financial corp established to be the parent company of medallion funding as a public company trading on the nasdaq under the symbol mfin the company has financed the purchase of thousands more in newark cambridge philadelphia chicago boston and new york city is an established industry leader but taxi loans are only a part of the story the company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners convenience stores manufacturers distributors and later public companies in  murstein invested million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis the subsidiary eventually named medallion taxi media was enhanced in  with the acquisition of see level advertising murstein sold medallion taxi media to clear channel yielding  million in  about this time medallion financial corp set up its own bank medallion bank to fund many of the company’s endeavors due to aggressive lending and outsize losses the bank accepted tarp money in  the banks loan losses in  were worse than  of banks in its peer group according to the ffiec in  it accepted an investment from the us treasury a security it has yet to repay the bank currently pays a  aftertax dividend on this preferred security in  murstein with former baseball star hank aaron and former new york governor mario cuomo both medallion financial board members and former football star and congressman jack kemp now deceased formed a specialpurpose acquisition company spac which raised million to buy a professional sports team the spac reportedly bid for the chicago cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance later that same year murstein organized and filed publicly a spac focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included former fbi director louis freeh and initial head of homeland security and former pennsylvania governor tom ridge on november

december  richard petty motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season under murstein’s leadership medallion today manages over  billion of investments the company has paid out over  in dividends to its shareholders since going public but suspended dividends in  due to losses from declining taxi medallion values in  murstein told barrons that the chances

father employed by his grandfather in his queensbased taxi business used to take young andrew along to the taxi garage where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late today murstein does not travel by taxi instead relying on a private driver paid for by medallion financial since  andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than  medallions when they decided to sell some in the s no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky they did not

seventy years ago a polish immigrant named leon murstein bought a single taxicab and started the company that would become medallion financial today with nearly  billion worth of loans under its belt this family business is still about making dreams come true one taxicab at a time andrew murstein president medallion financial andrew murstein knows a thing or two about the american dream when his grandfather leon came to this country from poland in the s he brought little with him beyond a drive to make a better life for himself to this end he started his own company with a single taxi license in  it cost him  and he drove the cab himself by the s that single cab had turned into a fleet of nearly  at  murstein together with his father alvin runs the company his grandfather founded and as president of the new york’s medallion financial has taken one man’s dream and turned it into a vehicle for hundreds more it was in  murstein explains that the successful taxi business made its initial transition into commercial lending “when my father got involved in the business he wanted to sell some taxis to take some chips off the table and no banks would provide financing for the buyers of those medallions so he had to take back the paper himself” he says “that’s how our finance company started” today the company’s motto “in niches there are riches” could not be more relevant since his father’s foray into commercial finance medallion has launched two new units and an industrial bank the company went public in  and trades on the nasdaq under the ticker symbol taxi but the company makes its breadandbutter in an industry few outside the transit world are aware exists most of us have seen the little metallic plaque on the front of taxicabs but few understand exactly what it represents for a taxi owner a medallion is like a ticket to the big time drivers save for years to get one and having one means no longer paying a flat rate to drive someone else’s cab for  hours a day medallion funding the company’s taxi lending arm offers financing to both fleet operators and single cab owners the medallion system was created in  when new york’s board of aldermen adopted the haas act which placed a moratorium on the issuance of new taxicab licenses according to bruce schaller a former industry consultant who now serves as new york’s deputy commissioner for planning and sustainability the system was crafted to address an overabundance of taxis that had depressed driver earnings and congested city streets beyond placing a cap on medallions the hass act provided for the automatic renewal of vehicle licenses and allowed for the transfer of licenses between owners “this transferability provision was vital to the subsequent establishment of license values” schaller writes in his article “villain or bogeyman new york’s taxi medallion system” a provision that would have allowed the city to issue additional medallions was repealed in  as a result the value of the licenses has continued to grow exponentially “taxi medallions have been maybe the best investment to own in the united states over the past  years —  they’ve outperformed the dow jones the nasdaq real estate gold almost every major index you can think of” says murstein while the dow has gone up  per year over the last  years taxi medallions have gone up almost double that at  per year since the company began lending in  medallion has facilitated more than  million in loans to this specific segment and what’s more boasts that it has never had a loss in  the company reported net earnings of  million an  increase over  medallion’s onbalance sheet taxicab medallion loan portfolio increased  to  million last year from  million in  and  million at yearend  “people assume that it’s not a growth business but our track record obviously shows the opposite” says murstein in fact despite dealing with a finite asset base — a number that hasn’t changed in  years — medallion financial has managed to grow more than  a year for the past five years murstein says medallion employs several strategies “for one there is the ever expanding value of the medallion” he explains “just like home equity loans when somebody’s home equity increases over time you’re going to take out a loan against it here guys tap into the equity of their medallions” and like real estate the value of taxi medallions has grown considerably  years ago the roughly  medallions circulating in new york had a collective value of  million today those same medallions are worth  billion murstein says in may  the price of a single corporate medallion hit an alltime record high of  owneroperator medallions which are issued to people who drive their own cabs are a little cheaper —  currently trading at around  “so as that balloon gets bigger and bigger we can grow our company just by lending more against the current owners that are customers of ours and their current medallions” murstein explains at the same time he says the company which spent the past three decades focused on new york city has recently been expanding into new markets today in addition to new york medallion offers loans in miami boston chicago newark baltimore and philadelphia finally medallion works aggressively to usurp market share from its competitors “we’ve been very effective at that we set up our own bank several years ago to lower our cost of funds and were able to take away market share from other lenders in the business” not that there’s much competition to worry about though “banks have never really financed this industry for several reasons for one they don’t understand lending on an intangible asset like a taxi medallion — you know they want to kick the tires on something like real estate or equipment” murstein says in new york medallion’s competition is limited to north fork bank — which prior to its  acquisition by capital one held a small number of taxi medallion loans on its balance sheet — and one or two credit unions that also lend in the sector in other cities like philadelphia for instance medallion is the only game in town murstein says the nature of the taxi business means many lenders choose to avoid it “these companies typically don’t have financial statements and bank regulators who want to see how they’re going to service the loan they want to see strong financial statements” murstein says “what’s more a lot of these customers don’t even speak english and banks are not accustomed to dealing with minority entrepreneurs like we are we’re very open to working with people who come to this country with no money in their pocket and just the dream to own their own business and we provide that opportunity for them” after more than  years in the taxi niche in the s murstein began considering a push into other niches and started expanding into other forms of lending among his pursuits was to begin investigating opportunities in assetbased lending at first he considered acquiring an established firm “we didn’t want to make the mistake that banks often make which is pay two or threetimes book value for something and then have the management and ownership walk away and we’re left holding the bag so we hired gerry grossman and his whole management team away from another bank” in  medallion business credit was founded to provide assetbased loans to commercial businesses the company serves a diverse customer base that includes manufacturers distributors food processors and finance companies murstein says medallion business credit specializes in funding “under the radar” deals ranging in size from  to  million secured by the borrower’s accounts receivable and inventory since its founding the unit has expanded from a staff of two to comprise  employees at two separate facilities in new york and new jersey grossman who serves as president of medallion business credit says he started in assetbased lending when it was known simply as “commercial finance” after the business he ran with his father and brother was sold in  grossman stuck around for a while before deciding to try his hand in the legal profession but his days as an attorney would be limited in  grossman was approached by new york’s sterling financial with an offer to join the company’s abl unit he eagerly rejoined the field and spent four years at sterling before jumping ship to help a friend at long island’s continental bank establish an abl unit in less than two years time grossman says he built continental business credit’s portfolio to  million attracting the attention of reliance federal savings bank which bought out continental bank in  after a short stint with israel discount bank grossman and his partner connie mitchko moved to medallion grossman says a key to the unit’s success is he and mitchko’s approach to customer service “we thrive on relationships — connie and i know every account we visit with them we field examine — we’re very hands on with the people we deal with” he says beyond abl medallion operates medallion capital which was set up in the s to make subordinated loans to small and mediumsized manufacturers retailers food service providers and other companies the company secures its loans with liens on the borrower’s assets and receives warrants or other types of equity participation in order to offset the additional risk assumed by the loan structure the company also operates medallion bank an fdicinsured industrial bank located in salt lake city ut which has helped the company address increasingly stringent cost of funds issues the strategy seems to be working in a time when the entire financial services industry is lamenting a dearth of liquidity murstein says he’s looking to expand “we have a lot of excess capital these days we’re always on the lookout for new lines of business to either buy existing companies or find good people to hire and go into new niche businesses” murstein says “we’re always trying to find new lines of businesses the reason we’ve been so successful is we’ve been good partners” christopher moraff is associate editor of the monitor leave a reply cancel reply
