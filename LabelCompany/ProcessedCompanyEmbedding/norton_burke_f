scan your computer with the software it will display the issues and give you the option to destroy the unwanted virus in a lot of cases the only difference between the free and paid versions are the added extras vpn parental control etc however if it is just antivirus software you are in the market for then the free version is a good option there are however some experts that will try and tell you that the free antivirus software providers offer a significantly poorer virus detection rate claims that a free version will only detect around  of viruses whereas a paid version will offer you up to a  detection rate however in reality the chances are if an antivirus software provider is offering you a free or trial version of their software it will be the same software that they are offering

security product line is to start with the standalone antivirus and then summarize the antivirus review as part of my review of the full security suite if theres an even bigger megasuite in the mix i summarize the entrylevel suite review however im going to take a different path this time this product has precisely the same excellent security components as symantec norton security deluxe these include topscoring antivirus awardwinning android security nohassle firewall consistently accurate phishing protection a full security suite for macos and more the premium edition adds five more licenses along with parental control and online backup neither of which is tightly coupled to the suites other components please read my review of the malware protection and other features of the deluxe edition first then come back here for my evaluation of the added premium features online and local backup security suite vendors like to promote that their products include online backup—it gives them a nice check mark in the features table however all too many of them simply offer a branded version of some partner product that their users could get for free directly from the partner check point zonealarm extreme security  offers gb of backup space that you could just as easily get directly from idrive for example nortons windowsspecific backup component is a completely inhouse product and sells separately for  per year pcmags max eddy didnt think much of norton online backup comparing it unfavorably with other standalone backup services but compared with backup components in other security suites it looks pretty good the online backup component comes preconfigured with a default backup set that defines what to back up where to store backedup files and when to run the backup it includes files in and below the documents folder for each user but specifically omits possibly massive video files and email files by default you can edit this backup set to fit your own needs or create any number of additional backup sets the default destination for your backedup files is nortons secure online storage but you can also back up locally while cddvd backup was removed in this edition due to low usage any other drive that shows up in windows explorer is a fair target that includes local hard drives remote drives network drives and even some cloud storage services the backup system in kaspersky total security doesnt come with online storage but you can link it to your dropbox account by default backup occurs automatically when your computer is idle thats probably best for ongoing maintenance but you may want to manually launch the first backup when youre done with your system for the day as the first time can take a while subsequent backups only transmit new and changed files so they run much faster you can also schedule a backup set to run on a weekly or monthly schedule you can also choose to throttle back the bandwidth used for backup an option thats only needed if you dont choose to back up during idle time the restore feature also comes preconfigured with logical defaults it restores files from the most recent backup though you can choose another to their original locations though you can select a different destination by default it waits for you to search out the file or files you want to recover you can optionally browse all backedup files or restore the entire backup set and you can access your backup sets as if they were local files and folders by opening the norton backup drive in windows explorer webroot secureanywhere internet security complete also offers gb of hosted storage for backing up and syncing files it keeps up to ten versions of files and lets you create links to securely share backedup files bullguard premium protection also lets you share files from its gb of online backup norton just keeps the latest version and secure sharing has been dropped in the current version few consumers actually used the feature and it made overall security more complex according to my symantec contact the fanciest backup system in the world wont help if it never gets used norton makes backup almost effortless which is as it should be parental control your norton security premium subscription also includes symantec norton family premier a  value if purchased separately yes the combined price of norton online backup and norton family premier is greater than the price of this entire suite and much greater than the  you spend to upgrade from norton family delux thats a great deal as with net nanny qustodio parental control  and other modern parental control systems all configuration and reporting takes place online with a small client app on each windows android or ios device to handle local monitoring and enforcement of house rules sorry mac users this component isnt for you to get started you log in to your norton account online and create a profile for each child the profile includes name birth year gender and an optional photo or avatar you can also add personal information that you dont want the child to share online next you add a device that the child uses or if its a pc the childs windows user account you can install the local norton family parental control agent on the current device or email a link keep going until youve created a profile for each of your kids theres no specific limit on the number of child profiles or devices with that task out of the way its time to define house rules for each profile first up is web supervision which manages content filtering based on the childs age norton selects from the  content categories and determines whether to block those categories or just give the child a warning you can pick your own custom set of categories and choose to block warn or just silently monitor contentwatch net nanny  is even more flexible letting you choose allow block or warn separately for each category when norton blocks access to a site it displays the reason the child can send parents a message explaining the attempt to visit the site or report that the site is categorized incorrectly if a child proceeds to the site despite a warning parents get notification norton actually checks page content if necessary i found that it allowed access to a shortstory website but blocked its erotic stories it filters secure https traffic so kids wont evade it by using a secure anonymizing proxy and it didnt cave to a simple threeword network command that disconnects some lessclever parental control systems i couldnt find any sites that should have been blocked but werent forcing safe search has become difficult now that popular search portals enforce use of htts bitdefender and trend micro simply dropped that feature from parental control though trend micro maximum security attempts to cover up naughty pictures in search results norton has taken a different tack search supervision enforces safe search on ask youtube google bing and yahoo it does so using a browser extension so a clever child might work around this restriction your child can turn off safe search and briefly see inappropriate links or pictures until the browser extension turns it on again video supervision keeps track of the videos your child watches on youtube or hulu social media supervision simply tracks the existence of your childs facebook account and reports if the child used a spurious age to set up the account or posted personal information all of the components ive mentioned thus far are enabled by default but time supervision is not turning this feature on automatically schedules when the child can use the device and sets a daily maximum for screen time based on the childs age for example my imaginary yearolds schedule allowed access from  am until  pm daily and until  pm on friday and saturday screen time was capped at two hours for weekdays five hours on the weekend if you want to tweak these settings you must edit each day separately you can also choose whether to cut off access or just issue a warning kids can check their remaining time by clicking the norton family icon in the notification area theres also an option to send a request for more time android devices can still be used after hours but norton prevents all app activity other than calling emergency contacts note that time scheduling applies separately to each device the child uses the equivalent feature in net nanny is crossdevice so your kid cant time out on the pc and just switch to android mobile parental control three more components become available when you assign an android device to the childs profile android protection is equivalent to norton family parental control for android some mobile parental control systems offer geofencing meaning you can get notification when your child enters or leaves a specific location nortons location supervision doesnt do that but if you enable it the childs device reports its position periodically and you can view current and past locations on a map app supervision lists all nondefault apps installed on the childs android device see something you dont like just check the box to block use of that app i couldnt actively test the advanced text supervision feature because my android test devices all lack cellular data connection heres how it works in the default monitored mode the child can text with any contact thats not specifically blocked norton logs all text conversations with unknown contacts parents can review the conversations and mark the contact as blocked or unmonitored in blocked mode unknowns cant contact your child at all until and unless you mark them as unmonitored in unmonitored mode all contacts not specifically marked as blocked are permitted with no logging if your child uses an ios device you can still install nortons parental control the equivalent of norton family parental control for iphone however theres just not much to it you do get content filtering but it only works in the apps internal browser during installation the app explains how to set up restrictions so your child cant use safari or chrome disable norton or download other browsers once thats done you get the full power of web supervision location supervision is also available just as it is on android video supervision and search supervision both work however on an ios device theres no time supervision mobile app supervision text message supervision or social media supervision if you really need fullpowered parental control on ios devices look to editors choice kaspersky safe kids for iphone parental reporting and notification so far ive just talked about how you use norton to define and enforce house rules the other half of the equation is what norton calls activities—the logs of what your children have been up to the activities summary shows the same eight types of supervision with an overview of the latest activity you can filter the summary to just look at one device in which case youll see a message stating this feature is not supported for categories that dont apply to that device clicking on one of the panel opens a more detailed view and in most cases you can drill down even farther for example the web supervision summary shows the mostused categories clicking it gets a full list of all sites visited warned or
