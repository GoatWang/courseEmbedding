description crossreference to related applications this application claims priority to us provisional patent applications ser no  filed on may   and ser no  filed on may   the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entiretyfield of the invention the subject matter of this invention relates to immersion interferometric lithography more particularly the subject matter of this invention relates to the use of excimer lasers for immersion interferometric lithography for fabrication of nanoscale structures background of the invention optical lithography is a wellestablished technique in the fabrication of semiconductor devices as semiconductor devices have continued to shrink in size alternative lithographic technologies have been explored including electron beam xray and ionbeam each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages electron beam lithography can produce structures at scales smaller than optical lithography and with complete pattern flexibility within the limits imposed by proximity effects in electron beam lithography the beam is scanned across the surface to be patterned the serial pattern generation in electron beam lithography makes it unsuitable where large area nanopatterning is required as in volume manufacturing on the other hand optical lithography is a parallel technique in which a large number of pixels are patterned at once traditional optical lithography uses a maskbased approach along with optical reduction to meet the demands of both the mask fabrication and the optical system interferometric lithography based on the interference of two or more coherent laser beams can produce useful patterns over large twodimensional areas and threedimensional volumes interferometric lithography can produce patterns approaching  nm in scale with considerable but not total pattern flexibility in conventional interferometric lithography a simple corner cube arrangement is often used where the right and left halves of the beam are folded onto each other using a ° geometry this arrangement has been used successfully with laser sources having a high transverse coherence such as single mode tem arion laser beams however excimer lasers exhibit a large number of transverse modes and consequently a very low transverse coherence hence the conventional interferometric lithography arrangement is not suitable since the two halves of the beam are not in general mutually coherent accordingly there is a need for apparatus and methods for conducting interferometric lithography that provides an inexpensive large area capability further by using multiple exposures multiple beams and mix and match with other lithographies one can extend the range of applicability of these apparatus and methods

both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed the accompanying drawings which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the inventionbrief description of the drawings fig  is a schematic illustration of an apparatus for carrying out interferometric lithography according to various embodiment of the present invention fig  is a schematic illustration of an exemplary apparatus for carrying out immersion interferometric lithography according to various embodiments of the present invention fig  shows a simple calculation of the fringe visibility for immersion lithography at  nm using water as an immersion liquid and transverse magnetic polarization figs a to e illustrate an exemplary process for creating a nanostructure using spatial period division in accordance with various embodiments of the present inventiondescription of the embodiments reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible any numerical value however inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements moreover all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all subranges subsumed therein for example a range of “less than ” can include any and all subranges between and including the minimum value of zero and the maximum value of  that is any and all subranges having a minimum value of equal to or greater than zero and a maximum value of equal to or less than  eg  to  in certain cases the numerical values as stated for the parameter can take on negative values in this case the example value of range stated as “less that ” can assume negative values eg− − − − − − etc fig  is a schematic illustration of an exemplary apparatus  for carrying out interferometric lithography the exemplary interferometric lithography apparatus  can include an input beam  and an optical arrangement for splitting the input beam  into a first beam  and a second beam  wherein the first beam  and the second beam  each fold onto each other within a transverse coherence length and a longitudinal coherence length the interferometric lithography arrangement  can further include a target  comprising a top surface  wherein the target  is disposed such that an interferometric pattern is formed by the first beam  and the second beam  on the top surface  of the target  the target  can also be placed on a rotation stage  according to various embodiments of the present invention the target  on the rotation stage  can be rotated to align the interferometric lithography pattern to be formed to a feature on the substrate such as for example a crystal direction in certain embodiments the target  on the rotation stage  can be rotated to produce d two dimensional and d three dimensional patterns using multiple exposures lithography refers to processes for defining a pattern on the top surface of the target furthermore interference refers to the resultant wave pattern as a result of superposition of two or more coherent waves that oscillate with a welldefined timeinvarient phase difference over the duration of the exposure hence in interferometric lithography two or more coherent optical beams incident from different directions on a twodimensional thin photosensitive film with thickness λ or threedimensional thick photosensitive film with thickness λ are used to produce an interference pattern whose intensity distribution is recorded in the photosensitive layer the interference pattern is later transferred developed by thermal and or chemical processes the photosensitive material can be a photoresist or any other material capable of undergoing a substantive change upon exposure to optical radiation where the optical radiation can be pulsed or continuous the change typically induced is a modulation of the dissolution rate in a chemical developer that depends in a complex nonlinear way on the local irradiance during the exposure in two beam interference two coherent optical plane waves with the same polarization symmetrically incident on a photosensitive layer at angle of θ produce an intensity pattern in space given by i⁡xze⁢e⁢ⅇⅈkx⁢ ⁢sin⁢ ⁢θe⁢ⅇⅈkx⁢ ⁢sin⁢ ⁢θe⁡e·e⁢eikx⁢ ⁢sin⁢ ⁢θe·e⁢ⅇⅈkx⁢ ⁢sin⁢ ⁢θ⁢e⁡σpol⁢cos⁡⁢kx⁢ ⁢sin⁢ ⁢θ where kπnλ with n the refractive index of the incident medium directly adjacent to the surface layer  for air and λ the optical wavelength êi is the unit polarization vector for each wave and σpol cosθ for te—transverse electric tm—transverse magnetic polarization with σte and σtmcosθ the period of the interference pattern along the xdirection is given by λn sin θ by snells law this period is invariant across any layer boundaries parallel to the top surface  of the target  this invariance is not true for the contrast the top surface  of the target  can be a lithography stack and can include various chemical and optically functional thin films such as a protective top coat and a bottom antireflective layer te polarization always gives the maximum contrast while the contrast is reduced for tm polarization as a result of the πphase shift between the êx and êz contributions to the interference intensity for the evaluation of polarization dependence it is important to use the propagation angles inside the photosensitive layer the contrast reduction for tm polarization becomes significant for steep angles in the photosensitive layer for n at angle of incidence of ° sin θ˜  therefore the limiting period of interferometric lithography is ≧λ and extends below  nm at a wavelength of  nm referring again to fig  the exemplary apparatus for interferometric lithography  can include an input beam  the input beam  shown for the purpose of illustration can include four representative rays a b c and d each identified on the figure by a different line style dashed dotted solid dotted respectively the input beam  can be split by a beam splitter  into two beams a first beam  including four representative rays a b c and d and a second beam  including four representative rays a b c and d in the figure the corresponding line styles have been retained for each ray the optical arrangement  can include optics  for reflecting the beam  the arrangement  can further include optics  and  to direct the second beam  such that the angular relationship between the rays and the normal to the sample surface are approximately equal and a path length of the first beam  and the second beam  between the beam splitter and the sample are approximately equal in certain embodiments the first beam  and the second beam  fold onto each other within the transverse and longitudinal coherence lengths as used herein the term “fold onto each other” refers to for example the ray a of the first beam  overlapping with the ray a of the second beam  ray b overlapping with the ray b ray c overlapping with the ray c and ray d overlapping with the ray d on the top surface  of the target  where an interferometric pattern is formed the requirement that the first beam  and the second beam  fold onto each other within a transverse coherence length and a longitudinal coherence length results in the requirement that the input beam  has narrow spectral width with respect to the inverse of the optical path length difference of the respective rays of beam  and  across the top surface  and hence significant coherence in certain embodiments the input beam  can have a very narrow linewidth linewidth pm and longitudinal coherence length of ˜λδλ≧ cm according to various embodiments the beam splitter  can be a grating beam splitter a grating beam splitter  can provide the necessary angular relationship of the first beam  and second beam  and also equal path lengths to provide self coherence across the pattern area  of the target  in accordance with other embodiments a phase grating  can be optimized to result in maximum coupling into the ± diffraction orders these two orders can then be recombined either with a second grating or with a pair of mirrors  and  to provide the aerial image pattern in various embodiments the input beam  can be provided by a light source such as an argon fluoride arf excimer laser in certain embodiments the top surface  of the target  can include a photoresist disposed over a substrate in other embodiments additional thin film layers with various functionalities can be added to the photoresist to protect the resist eg a top coat layer to enhance the transferability of the resultant pattern a socalled hard mask layer and to reduce reflection effects both top and bottom antireflective layers are commonly used according to various embodiments fig  illustrates an apparatus  for immersion interferometric lithography the apparatus  for immersion interferometric lithography can include an input beam  and an optical arrangement for splitting the input beam  into a first beam  and a second beam  wherein the first beam  and the second beam  each fold onto each other within a transverse coherence length and a longitudinal coherence length the apparatus  can also include a target  comprising a top surface  wherein the target  is disposed such that an interferometric pattern is formed by the first beam  and the second beam  on the top surface  of the target  the apparatus  can also include a prism  disposed in an optical path of the first beam  and second beam  the apparatus  can further include an immersion liquid  disposed over the target  in certain embodiments the immersion liquid  contacts the prism  and the top surface  of the target  the presence of immersion liquid  between the prism  and the top surface  of the target  increases the optical resolution of the patterning process by a factor of the refractive index of the immersion liquid  in various embodiments water with a refractive index of about  at  nm can be used as an immersion liquid  fig  shows a simple calculation of the fringe visibility for immersion lithography using water as an immersion liquid and  nm as the exposure wavelength in immersion lithography polarization is an important parameter at steep angles in the photoresist for te polarization the fringe visibility imax−iminimaximin is unity independent of the half pitch however for tm polarization the fringe visibility decreases as the half pitch is decreased as a result of competition between the out of phase ex and ez contributions to the intensity at an interference angle of ° in the photoresist these two terms are equal and opposite in phase and the visibility goes to zero for larger interference angles the linespace pattern is inverted that is the lines become spaces and vice versa equivalent to a shift of the pattern by ½ the period in fig  the cusp ˜ nm corresponds to the inversion of the pattern—the interchange of lines and spaces the minimum half pitch available with a  nm source and water as the immersion liquid is  nm if a higher index liquid is available the glass of the lens sets the limit at  nm with a higher index glass as the final lens element smaller half pitch patterns can be generated accordingly the reduction in the fringe contrast and the linespace inversion require some form of polarization control for imaging the small half pitch patterns turning now to the method for conducting interference lithography the method can include providing a light source that provides an input beam  said light source characterized by both a longitudinal and a transverse coherence length providing an optical arrangement  for splitting the input beam  in into a first beam  and a second beam  wherein the first beam  and the second beam  each fold onto each other within a transverse coherence length and a longitudinal coherence length the method can further include providing a target  comprising a top surface  wherein the target  is disposed such that an interferometric pattern is formed by the first beam  and the second beam  on the top surface  the top surface  can be a photoresist layer on a substrate the method can also include providing a prism  disposed in an optical path of the first beam  and in an optical path of the second beam  in another embodiment of the present invention the method can include providing an immersion liquid  disposed over the target  in certain embodiments the method can further include providing an immersion liquid  in contact with the prism  and the top surface  of the target  according to various embodiments the method for conducting interference lithography can include placing the target  on a rotation stage  rotating the target  to align the interferometric lithography pattern to be formed to a feature on the substrate such as crystal direction in other embodiments the method can also include rotating the target  on the rotation stage to produce d two dimensional and d three dimensional patterns using multiple exposures figs a to e illustrates exemplary process for creating nanostructures using spatial period division in accordance with various embodiments of the present teachings in spatial period division or spatial frequency multiplication the nonlinearities in the exposure development and processing can be used to increase the pattern density in certain embodiments nonlinearities can be applied between exposure steps and images can be combined in such a way as to reduce or eliminate the lower frequency components and thereby leaving the higher density of structures referring to fig a a process for creating nanostructures using spatial period division includes making a first pattern  on a first layer of photoresist  atop a sacrificial layer  on a substrate  using immersion interferometric lithography the sacrificial layer  can be photoresist the period of the interferometric lithography pattern  is limited by the optics to around λ na the cd critical dimension is not limited by the optics and can be chosen to be less than λ na the process for creating nanostructures can include transferring the first pattern  onto the sacrificial layer  as illustrated in fig b in fig b the transferred pattern  onto sacrificial layer  can be fabricated by etching process one of ordinary skill in the art would know that the etching includes but is not limited to chemical plasma physical ion milling and reactive ion etching the process can further include depositing a second layer of photoresist  over the sacrificial layer  and making a second pattern  on the second layer of photoresist  using immersion interferometric lithography but shifted by λ na fig c shows the second pattern  shifted by phase λ na with respect to the pattern  and the pattern  on the sacrificial layer  fig d shows that the process for creating nanostructures can further include transferring the second pattern  onto the sacrificial layer  the second pattern  onto the sacrificial layer  is shown in fig d fig e shows that the process of fabricating nanostructures can also include transferring the first  and second  composite pattern  onto the substrate  hence as shown in fig e the final pattern  at period of λ na can be twice as dense as the single exposure optical limit λ na the nonlinearities in the process give rise to harmonics of the fundamental frequency in the exposure—which is limited to nλ by the lowfrequency bandpass characteristics of optics for a square wave resulting from the nonlinearity the resultant exposure as a result of spatial frequency multiplication is given by t⁡xn⁡i⁡x⊗n⁡i⁡xa⁢⁢ⅇⅈ⁢⁢ ⁢π⁢ ⁢lnaλ⁢xa⁢∑l⁢sin⁢⁢ ⁢π⁢ ⁢lnaaλ⁢ ⁢π⁢ ⁢lnaaλ⁢ⅇⅈ⁢⁢ ⁢π⁢ ⁢lnaλ⁢x where tx is the resultant exposure nix  nix are the nonlinearities in the first and second exposure it is well known that the fourier series expansion of a square wave is the sinxx as given in the above equation the second exposure and nonlinearity also produce a square wave but shifted by ½ the pitch this gives rise to the factor of − raised to the ith power the net result is that the even i        terms reinforce and the odd terms i       cancel leaving a square wave at twice the original pitch or ½ the spacing in the above equation for the resultant exposure tx the operator between the two nonlinear exposures nix  nix can be other than simple addition other functionalities such as multiplication subtraction etc can be envisioned with other process sequences in the exemplary process for fabricating nanostructures illustrated in fig a to e the combination is simple addition in another exemplary case wherein the two resist layers  and  can be sensitive at different wavelengths the combination can be multiplication the p shift of the second exposure results in a factor of −i in the fourier coefficients with the net result that all of the odd terms cancel leaving a sinxx pattern at twice the original pitch or half the period in various embodiments of the present invention the spatial frequency multiplication can be applied to arbitrary patterns as well as to the periodic grating pattern in certain embodiments the process can be repeated multiple times for integer spatial frequency multiplications      while the description of spatial frequency multiplication provided above is presented in terms of a sacrificial layer with process steps between the two exposures developing the resist transferring the resist pattern into the sacrificial layer and recoating a second photoresist layer other approaches to applying the nonlinearity such as the use of a saturable absorber layer atop the photosensitive material can be used alternatively and equivalently the advantage of using a saturable absorber layer is that the wafer does not have to be removed from the exposure system between exposures allowing a higher throughput as disclosed herein immersion interferometric lithography can be a parallel optical process that is scalable to full wafer areas further interferometric lithography is maskless and therefore changing pitch apertureperiod ratio pattern symmetry can be rapid and inexpensive immersion interferometric lithography can be used in the areas of nanofluidics such as bionano interface separation and sequencing switches—fluidic transistors and lab on a chip interferometric lithography in the field of plasmonics and metamaterials provide new direction for infrared enhanced detectors and eliminate the need for phase matching in nonlinear optics interferometric lithography can be used to make masks for imprint lithography photonic crystals for dfb lasers tunable lasers for spectroscopy and photonic crystals waveguide nonvolatile memory media such as hard disk drives can also benefit from segmentation of the magnetic media either into tracks or into individual domains interferometric lithography or immersion interferometric lithography can also be applied to this large scale manufacturing requirement while the
