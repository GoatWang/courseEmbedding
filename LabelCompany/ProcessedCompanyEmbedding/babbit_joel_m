avenue have crossed the chief creative officer of atlanta ad agency grey worldwide  with clients from bellsouth corp to georgiapacific  will become the president of new yorkbased gci one of the worlds largest public relations firms enlarge joel babbit he has been named president of new yorkbased gci one of the worlds… more grey and gci are sister companies that share office space in midtown atlanta and share a parent company the publicly traded londonbased holding company wpp group plc new yorkbased grey global group is the sixthlargest communications company in the world including gci its pr division babbit says although hes one of the first ad men to simultaneously become the head of a pr agency while maintaining his hold on the atlanta ad company  he wont be the last i know this is the direction things are heading in said babbit i see it every day with our clients theyre saying look i need some great ideas i need some new ways of thinking the client doesnt care anymore where an idea comes from as long as its good babbit  now president and chief creative officer for gci is known for his eccentric marketing ideas he was hired by mayor maynard jackson to sell the atl and once proposed beaming ads to earthlings from outer space during the  olympics more recently his ad agency was the creative force behind brand atlanta responsible for the city slogan every day is an opening day the campaign received a lukewarm welcome by some but is being used by many of the citys boosters and attractions the ad man is also known as a principal of the electric ad agency babbit  reiman which had its heyday in the gogo s giving atlanta a place albeit fleeting in advertising lore that agency was bought by londonbased ggt in  babbit later founded ad agency  with partner mark goldman after jointly pitching and winning bellsouths ad account with grey global grey acquired  in  bellsouth is still the atlanta offices largest account said babbit but hes never led a company the size of gci which has  employees and admits it will be an experiment babbit cited recent articles in pr week an industry journal debating the blurring of the lines between public relations and advertising many believe this is the future public relations usually intersects in the ceos office especially when theyve got a big opportunity or a big problem said tom bell president and ceo of cousins properties inc in atlanta and a client of grey atlanta bell himself is a former ad man retiring as chairman and ceo of young  rubicam inc nyse ynr when it merged with wpp nasdaq wppgy in  i think that less emphasis is put on pure advertising or paid media and more emphasis is put on overall brand building and strategy said bell probably babbit can do that just as well or better from the chair hes going to be in than the one he has been in more and more over the past  years as traditional media have given way to ad spaces on the internet cell phones email and niche cable channels advertisers have been following a more integrated approach said birgit wassmuth the chair of the communications department at kennesaw state university public relations internet advertising product placement and guerrilla or street marketing now fill the spaces socalled traditional advertising used to occupy historically its been unusual to cross lines like that said jeff johnson general manager of new york ad agency cramerkrasselt and the former head of atlanta ad shop westwayne historically what have been disparate disciplines are really merging together he said of pr and advertising it makes sense in theory that these lines merge as clients want more and more flexibility with getting out their messages still jack odwyer who writes an influential pr newsletter based in manhattan with about  unique hits online each month wasnt in favor of the move pr and advertising are very different types of communication advertisings job is to convince the consumer while prs job is to convince the press a much more demanding audience  a major function of pr is debating the pros and cons of something ads dont engage in debates but kennesaws wassmuth sees that as an old rivalry during the last decade the buzzword has been integrated marketing campaigns of which public relations is an element she said she sees crossovers and linkages in the nowblanket term of marketing from product placement to scripts of movies like castaway in which fedex corp plays a major role the goal she said is to reach a target audience in many areas ideally in an unexpected situation or under the radar its all a battle for the hearts minds and dollars of consumers and babbit will be running a twoflank assault to gain more market share for his clients its pushing the envelope but i think thats what is required said jeff hunt the gci ceo who is handing over his title of president to babbit hunt will be in charge of operations as babbit leads gcis creative and strategic thinking the status quo wont succeed in this new world order im glad people view this as an unusual outofthebox move said hunt thats reassuring to me gci group headquartered in new york has  offices worldwide and babbits goal is to visit each one in the next few years from bangkok to budapest gcis global clients include dell genentech intercontinental hotels group plc merck microsoft corp nike and starbucks babbit will be based in atlanta much like ceo hunt is based in houston i see him almost like a gravitational force to help us shift our orientation to the marketplace hes wildly creative said hunt hes always right for the times and very relevant for the marketplace babbit admitted to being a bit nervous with a job of this magnitude and he knows hell be under the microscope leading the experiment in blurring the lines said babbit ill only mind that if it doesnt work out coming together grey global atlanta  ad clients aig developer of atlantic stationatlanta falcons  newest accountbellsouth corp  largest accountbrand atlantacousins
