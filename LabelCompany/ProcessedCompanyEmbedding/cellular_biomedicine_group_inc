early stage biotech with no debt project targets include expansion of inhouse manufacturing facilities in china to support up to  x  treatments per annumchina has four times the population of the us while this uschina company has access to both markets on fda and china product approvalcbmgs pipeline is still partly early stage and costly while manufacturing expansion accommodates future costscellular biomedicine group nasdaqcbmg has investment potential for a number of reasons its primary market china has at least four times the population of the united states and has an aging population and cbmg is interested in the us market too its last k states that stem cell products for injection into painful joints will fuel an overall increase in the use of us stem cellbased treatments with an increase to  billion in  a sizeable market key growth areas for stem cell treatments are spinal fusion sports medicine and osteoarthritis of the joints source cbmg  k according to international journal of rheumatic diseases   of koa patients will degenerate to the point of disability conventional treatment usually involves invasive surgery with painful recovery and physical therapy as drugbased methods of management are ineffective the same journal estimates that some  million patients with this disability will degenerate to the point of requiring artificial joint replacement surgery every year however only  patients will actually be able to undergo replacement surgery leaving the majority of patients to suffer from a lifelong disability due to lack of effective treatment osteoarthritis is one of the ten most disabling diseases in developed countries worldwide estimates are that  of men and  of women aged over  years have symptomatic osteoarthritis it is estimated that the global oa therapeutics market was worth  billion in  and is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate cagr of  to reach  billion by  cbmg management is well seasoned with us university educated expertise and experience from astrazeneca abbvie and medimmune its product pipeline is diversified across stem cells and immunooncology with relatively low cost product testing vested in chinese hospitals but to chinese and us fda standards it has inhouse cellular manufacturing facilities in china being expanded in  quality management systems are iso  approved  patents are filed internationally just  outstanding shares  million in cash february  and currently no debt so whats not to like well in terms of potential stock dilution an overseas structure with contracted subsidiaries product pipeline and stock trending there are risks history of high stock volatility and prices cbmg stock has a history of a much lower float and high share price valuations due to trading volatility that has attracted momentum traders in the past but the amount of issued shares has tripled even so the outstanding stock less insider ownership is still relatively small the stock has been holding a longterm price low for some months now but below longterm moving averages assuming the imminent low holds it could bode well for a long position overseas operations cbmg is a usorientated business but with operations in china there are risks in investing in overseas businesses nasdaq for instance delisted a block of companies operating in china because having sent investigators to compare local filings with those in the us there was found to be a material difference since then standards for auditing all us businesses have improved and that includes the situation for overseas operations i described this issue in more detail in another stock article sentiment and litigation many chinaoriented businesses have suffered from poor sentiment over recent years for those with chinese fraud concerns cellular biomedicine group inc has successfully defended a fraudulent claim lawsuit although its currently on appeal the company advises its frivolous and includes persons it has no connection with it has also recently received a recent and substantial  million grant from a californian university which adds to its credibility company structure cbmg shanghai holds  interest in its subsidiaries in china but the ownership of cbmg shanghai is controlled by asset agreements these contracts were replaced last november according to the k filed recently which now offers some transparency including a statement that cbmg shanghai grants to the wfoe cbmg wuxi an irrevocable and exclusive option to purchase at its sole discretion any or all of cbmg shanghai assets at the lowest purchase price permissible under prc laws the term of the agreement is  years provided however the agreement may be extended at the option of the wfoe since this agreement permits the wfoe to determine the service fee at its sole discretion the agreement in effect provides the wfoe with rights to all earnings of the vie so the contract covers the assets owned by cbmg shanghai and ensures exclusive service provision to them over the year agreement while allowing outright acquisition of assets by wfoe a cbmg wholly owned company held by cbmg shanghai at the cheapest price possible in china its possible that cbmg shanghai could sell its shell to another organization the contract is on the assets held rather than the company shell itself however the loan agreement terms include power of attorney over the directors in shanghai whose shares are held as security within a pledge by both directors to surrender them on any default in a formal equity interest pledge agreement further detail is supplied in the k but the risk summary is as follows there are several stock holdingbusinesses available for sale which are mentioned in its filings either linked to the us or china corporations arem pacific corporation otcpkarpc alpha lujo inc otcpkalev and wonder international education  investment group corporation otcwiei no other information is available and they are not mentioned in the organization structure so maybe theyre just not active operations product pipeline cbmgs pipeline covers immunotherapy and stem cell research with an application for severe autoimmune disease this means investment risk is spread over two different branches of biotechnology its cart and t central memory cell tcm based immunooncology are very early stage with two candidates in phase  and others at the preclinical stage my interest and focus is really on its stem cell therapy hundreds of american athletes are already using stem cell therapy for sports injuries and cartilage regeneration but cbmgs product offers superior cell growth also it seems to have limited known competition in china source  k competitors to our knowledge the only ones based in and operating in greater china are beike lorem vascular which has partnered with cytori to commercialize cytori cell therapy for the cardiovascular renal and diabetes markets in china and hong kong and olife bio a medipost joint venture with jingyuan bio in taian shandong province who plans to initiate clinical trial in china in  according to cbmgs recent k filing its process is distinguishable from sole stromal vascular fraction svf therapy a large study with positive results by multiple additional biomarkers such as cd cd cd cdd hlai hladr actin cd cd and cd the k also outlines its strategy we intend to apply us standard operating procedures sops and protocols while complying with chinese regulations while owning developing and executing our own clinical trial protocols we plan to establish domestic and international joint ventures or partnerships to set up cell laboratories andor research facilities acquire technology or inlicense technology from outside of china and build affiliations with hospitals to develop a commercialization path for our therapies once approved we intend to use our firstmover advantage in china against a backdrop of enhanced regulation by the central government to differentiate ourselves from the competition and establish a leading position in the china cell therapeutic market we also intend to outlicense our technologies to interested parties and are exploring the feasibility of a us allogeneic koa clinical study with the fda stem cells in medicine some background on stem cell research stems cells are able to develop into any number of different specialist tissue cells the fda have approved at least five hematopoietic stemcell products in the us for the treatment of blood and immunological diseases wiki and heres an example of a surgeon offering a bone marrow sourced stem cell therapy stemgenex has just launched a rheumatoid arthritis stem cell study but there are other positive results lead author dr thomas vangsness of the university of southern californias keck school of medicines report on arthritis researchers at duke university health system who produced an early report on mice with fractures while hundreds of athletes are already making use of stem cell treatments to heal torn cartilage cbmg research is on stem cells derived from adipose fatty tissue which have different characteristics as described here numerous other studies are referenced on the same link adipose tissue hosts multipotent stem cells that can easily be purified by digestion and adhesion to plastic surfaces and share numerous properties with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells mscs five percent of the nucleated fraction in adipose tissue represents stem cells which is far more than found in adult human bone marrow adiposederived stem cells adscs have been shown to exhibit immune suppressive properties and release antiinflammatory molecules like il il receptor antagonist ilra indoleamine  dioxygenase transforming growth factor tgfβ and prostaglandin e the second angle of stem cell therapy also reduces potential risk on the part of the investor as opposed to entire exposure to early stage immunotherapy results cbmgs rejoin® phase b has completed and met primary and secondary endpoints for safety and provided both symptom relief and cartilage regeneration two other studies are preclinical and phase  phase  results indicate the total womac scores consisting of pain stiffness and function scores of joints as a primary endpoint show statistical treatment significance at week  compared to the baseline the total knee cartilage volume change measured by a semiautomated segmentation method itksnap by two different blinded researchers show significant gain of cartilage in the rejoin® group but a loss of cartilage in artzgroup reaching statistical difference between the two groups  weeks after therapy funding manufacturing expansion there are manufacturing positives the issue in  is the intended expansion and paying for it alongside the pipeline burn rate the dollar exchange rate to the yuan fluctuates too international standards this is a company incorporated in the us but operating in china so conducting studies at far lower cost than the us to cfda standards and to us fda standards too which means that the results could still be used in a us application while cost and so potential for stock dilution is much reduced for example a company target for q  is its allojoin® ind submission for knee osteoarthritis to us fda the company operates gmp manufacturing facilities consisting of  independent cell production lines in three facilities in shanghai beijing and wuxi china facilities are designed and managed according to both china and us gmp standards which meet international standards and are certified by china food and drug administration cfda authorized accreditation agencies financing the pipeline the company has created revenue in past quarters which it states is entirely from consulting services cash burn is an issue however as the pipeline has expanded over recent years and despite its consulting business creating some revenue quarterly operational expenses expanded significantly in q it will be years though before rejoin® could be creating income the annual operating loss was  in  compared with  in  however comparing q results alone costs about doubled although that included one large chunk of investment impairment m in cash could last  years and some clarification from management would be useful as the stated financial impairment could be a one off with a phase  rejoin® study cost outstanding and manufacturing expansion expected the company has no debt but could be relying on shareholders and institutions to fund development in preference to taking that on in the future k excerpt based on current estimates we expect our biopharmaceutical business to generate revenues primarily through the development of therapies for the treatment of koa within the next three to four years also an issue is when to buy stock charts short term the daily chart is reversing up from oversold conditions longer term on the weekly chart however the issues become more apparent as the stock has been continually failing a strike at higher prices despite what appears to have been an earlier technical breakout in terms of wave continuum weakness is apparent from continuous trading below the ma which has now turned down below the ma in a bearish cross trading below the pivot which is bearish continuously failing below the ma what could have been a double bottom failed to materialize with trading striking an inter week low below that of january  trading has however reversed up on both the daily and weekly bullish candlesticks although on the weekly chart less pronounced than that of early  since the daily low was created interday and recovered it doesnt represent a technical breakdown s is still a potential lower support level though based on the high of  creating a continuation of wave c should trading break down again cbmg doesnt as yet have a product past phase  but is unusual in that the company benefiting from a recent californian university cash award has no current debt and an opportunity in a very large overseas as well as domestic market with diverse pipeline candidates this stock is probably suffering from antichinese investment sentiment the lawsuit history along with concerns about the business structure as the shanghai agreement has literally become transparent for only about a week in addition to rising operating expenses short term the stock appears to be bouncing but needs to hold the support outlined in green on the daily chart so far the black adx line over the macd is flattening out which is a positive sign although the fast stochastic is on a low bouncing sideways on this level happened in decemberjanuary and resulted in lower prices while even a bounce over the ma resulted in lower prices the risk area is at the moving averages as the rsi becomes overbought again traders or investors considering an entry on the lows should hold a close stop cbmg really needs a consistent break over the ma on the daily chart for a confirmed bull leg disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours

cell “cart” and antipd technologies and ii human adiposederived mesenchymal progenitor cells “hampc” for treatment of joint and autoimmune diseases with primary research and manufacturing facilities in china while meeting dual standards   from february   to june   we operated the company in two separate reportable segments i biomedicine cell therapy “biomedicine” and ii financial consulting “consulting”  the consulting segment was conducted through our whollyowned subsidiary eastbridge investment corp “eastbridge sub”  on june   the company announced the discontinuation of the consulting segment as it no longer fits into management’s longterm strategy and vision  the company will focus resources on becoming a pureplay biotechnology company bringing therapies to improve the health of patients in china   on september   the company completed its acquisition of beijing agreen biotechnology co ltd ag and the us patent held by cellular immunity tech ltd a company controlled by the founder   ag is a biotech company with operations in china engaged in the development of treatments for cancerous diseases utilizing proprietary cell technologies which include without limitation preparation of subset t cell and clonality assay platform technology for treatment of a broad range of cancers by ag’s primary hospital partner jilin hospital   on february   the company announced its acquisition of chinese pla general hospitals plagh beijing also known as  hospital cart therapy its recombinant expression vector cd cd cd and human epidermal growth factor receptors egfr or her immunooncology patents applications and phase i clinical data of the aforementioned therapies and manufacturing knowledge  the  hospital team has conducted several preliminary clinical studies of various cart constructs targeting cdpositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cdpositive lymphoma cdpositive hodgkins lymphoma and egfrherpositive advanced lung cancer cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic cancer and renal cell carcinoma  pursuant to the terms of a technology transfer agreement plagh agreed to transfer to the company all of its right title and interest in and to certain technologies currently

breakthroughs with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as antipd or pdl monoclonal antibody treatments there are still significant unmet medical needs in nonsmall cell lung cancer “nsclc” and the disease remains largely incurable we believe the cdlgvax vaccine in combination with an antipd monoclonal antibody may provide synergistic and improved clinical benefits in both pdl positive and negative patients we previously anticipated a phase iii clinical trial for the cdlgvax vaccine combined with pd antibody to commence in the second half of   we currently evaluating both us and nonus options for furthering clinical trials for the cdlgvax vaccine following moffitt cancer center’s notification to us that it will not be continuing its sponsorship of the us cdlgvax trial in the third

immune response against cancer stem cells the root cause of cancer metastasis and recurrence our tumor cell target dendritic cell “tcdc” product candidate has successfully completed a us fda phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic melanoma at the hoag medical center in california we have a process to develop human embryoderived motor neuronal precursor cells and human embryoderived neuronal precursor cells with high purity levels validated by synapse formation and have shown functional innervation with human muscle cells  under applicable international reciprocity procedures we are utilizing data generated in a us phase ii clinical trial in an analogous chinabased phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma “hcc” a major type of liver cancer management believes we will be able to leverage skin cancer data produced in ongoing trials in the us and apply it toward advancing our product candidate for the treatment of liver cancer and other cancerrelated indications  as of december   we have completed the hcc phase i trial   with the advent of more advanced technologies in our portfolio at present we do not plan on continuing the hcc trial we are evaluating hospitals’ post tcm treatment data to ascertain whether clinical studies for certain cancer disease indications may be warranted   we plan to continue to evaluate and prioritize our cancer clinical trial indications for commercialization using safe and effective therapy or combination therapies we announced results from our phase i trial for certain of cart cancer immunotherapy programs on march  may  and late september  the phase i trial data for the cd cd and cd and egfr her  constructs showed a positive response rate under controllable toxicities   on october   the company announced results from the plagh phase iia clinical trial evaluating the safety feasibility and antitumor activity of its acquired cart immunotherapy cbmcd targeting cd for the treatment of patients with advanced bcell nonhodgkin lymphoma nhl  overall objective response rate orr is   with durable responses observed  a total of ten patients were treated with cbmcd seven patients with diffuse large bcell lymphoma dlbcl and three patients with other types of nhl the phase iia results showed that cbmcd immunotherapy was safe well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of patients with advanced nhl the data was selected for an oral presentation entitled “treatment of cddirected chimeric antigen receptormodified t cells in patients with advanced bcell nonhodgkin lymphoma an early phase iia trial report” at the  th international conference on translational medicine in baltimore   koa   in  we completed a phase iiia clinical trial for our “koa therapy named rejoin™ the trial tested the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injections of autologous hampcs in order to reduce inflammation and repair damaged joint cartilage the month followup clinical data showed rejoin™ therapy to be both safe and effective   in q  we completed patient enrollment for the phase iib clinical trial of rejoin™  for koa the multicenter study has enrolled  patients to participate in a randomized single blind trial we published week followup data of phase iiia on december    the week data indicated that patients have reported a decrease in pain and a significant improvement in mobility and flexibility while the clinical data shows our rejoin™ regenerative medicine treatment to be safe  we announced interim phase iib clinical trial results of koa therapy named rejoin ™  on march   which confirmed that the primary and secondary endpoints of rejoin™   therapy groups have all improved significantly compared to their baseline we released positive  week followup data in january    cartilage damage   in january  we initiated patient recruitment to support a study of rejoin™  hampc therapy for cd resulting from osteoarthritis “oa” or sports injury the study is based on the same science that has shown tremendous progress in the treatment of koa both arthroscopy and the use of magnetic resonance imaging “mri” will be deployed to further demonstrate the regenerative efficacy of rejoin™ on cd     asthma   in q of  we began a preclinical study on hampc therapy for asthma the preclinical study conducted by shanghai first people’s hospital a leading teaching hospital affiliated with shanghai jiaotong university will evaluate the safety and efficacy of hampcs to treat severe asthma   copd copd refers to a group of diseases that block airflow to the lungs and make it difficult to breathe the two most common conditions that make up copd are chronic bronchitis and emphysema which gradually destroys the smallest air passages bronchioles in the lungs currently the common treatments for copd such as use of steroids inhalers and bronchodilator drugs aim to control the symptoms and minimize further damage but do not reverse the tissue damage the major risk factors for copd in china are tobacco smoking biomass fuel use and genetic susceptibility   our preclinical copd study is being conducted by shanghai first peoples hospital a leading teaching hospital affiliated with shanghai jiaotong university professor zhou xin director of the hospitals respiratory department and chairperson of respiratory diseases division of shanghai medical association will lead the study as principal investigator            the  unique lines of adult adiposederived stem cells and the immune cell therapies enable us to create multiple cell formulations in treating specific medical conditions and diseases as well as applying single cell types in a specific treatment protocol management believes that our adult adiposederived line will become commercially viable and marketready within three to four years in addition we plan to assess and initiate cancer clinical trials leading to commercialization using safe and most effective therapy or combination therapies our facilities are certified to meet the international standards nsfansi  iso or equivalent ansincsl z and cfr as well as cfda standards cnas l in addition to standard protocols we use proprietary processes and procedures for manufacturing our cell lines comprised of   ●   banking processes that ensure cell preservation and viability       ●   dna identification for stem cell ownership and       ●   biosafety testing at independently certified laboratories   in july  the company has received two new certifications from the cfda for its proprietary cell and tissue preservation media kits respectively in accordance with the cfda’s new regulations announced on june   these certified kits enable longterm preservation and long distance shipment of cells and tissue without freezing them down from and to the point of care for ready applications by physicians the latest certifications further strengthen our vertically integrated cell manufacturing system “vicms” to centralize the processing and supplying of autologous cell therapies and reinforce our potential to be a worldclass biotechnology company serving large unmet medical needs   our strategy   the majority of our biomedicine business is in the development stage we intend to concentrate our business on cell therapies and in the nearterm carrying our koa stem cell therapy and cancer immune cell therapies to commercialization   with the recent addition of our cancer immune cell therapy resources we plan to evaluate and prioritize our cancer clinical trial indications for commercialization using safe and most effective therapy or combination therapies the company believes that when integrated with cbmgs stateoftheart infrastructure and clinical platform the aforementioned acquired ag  hospital and usf technologies will improve our cancer immune cell therapies clinical pathway and pave the way for collaboration with renowned institutions we plan to initiate certain cancer clinical trials upon receiving acceptance of the clinical trial designs with the principal investigator and obtaining the requisite approvals   in the next  months we aim to accomplish the following   ●   confirm the safety and tolerability profile of cbmegfr in cholangiocarcinoma and nsclc ●   explore the cbmegfr opportunities in other solid tumor indications ●   seek early possibilities of conducting multicenter phase iib trials to validate the clinical activity from early cbmegfr observation ●   confirm the safety and tolerability profile of cbmcd targeting cd for nhl ●   explore the cbmcd opportunities in other cancer indications ●   seek early possibilities of conducting multicenter phase iib trials to validate the clinical activity from early cbmcd observation ●   evaluate potential partners to develop an immunohistochemistry based diagnostic assay to aid in the patient selection whenever needed ●   launch phase ii trials to explore the efficacy and safety of cd or cd cart mono or combination therapies in chemo refractoryrelapsing patients with hematological malignancies ●   file new cart and other patents ●   obtain approval for pending patents ●   evaluate the feasibility of sponsoring a multisites phase iii clinical study to support the new drug application nda for the us cdlgvax trial ●   evaluate feasibility of sponsoring a registration triallike clinical study to support the new drug application nda for an allogeneic hampc knee osteoarthritis therapy “allo koa” study in the united states ●   complete preclinical glp safety evaluation studies of hampc for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd ●   provide update on cartilage damage clinical study ●   develop preclinical package for allogeneic hampc therapy for copdasthma clinical trial ●   continue to seek advanced technologies to bolster our cart china market position ●   bolster rd resources to fortify our intellectual properties portfolio and scientific development ●   file registration for our  stock option plan and ●   improve liquidity by registering the shares sold in previous private placements and further fortify our balance sheet by courting institutional investors            we are developing our business in cell therapeutics and capitalizing on the increasing importance and promise that adult stem cells have in regenerative medicine our most advanced candidate involves adiposederived mesenchymal stem cells to treat koa   presently we have two autologous cell therapy candidates undergoing clinical trials in china for the treatment of koa and cd if and when these therapies gain regulatory approval in the prc we will be able to market and offer them for clinical use although our biomedicine business was very recently organized our technologies have been in development for decades and our focus is on the latest translational stages of product development principally from the preclinical trial stage to regulatory approval and commercialization of new therapies   our strategy is to develop safe and effective cellular medicine therapies for indications that represent a large unmet need in china based on technologies developed both inhouse and obtained through acquisition licensing and collaboration arrangements with other companies our near term objective is to pursue successful clinical trials in china for our koa application followed by our cd and asthma therapies  we intend to utilize our comprehensive cell platform to support multiple cell lines to pursue multiple therapies both allogeneic and autologous we intend to apply us standard operating procedures sops and protocols while complying with chinese regulations while owning developing and executing our own clinical trial protocols we plan to establish domestic and international joint ventures or partnerships to set up cell laboratories andor research facilities acquire technology or inlicense technology from outside of china and build affiliations with hospitals to develop a commercialization path for our therapies once approved we intend to use our firstmover advantage in china against a backdrop of enhanced regulation by the central government to differentiate ourselves from the competition and establish a leading position in the china cell therapeutic market  we also intend to outlicense our technologies to interested parties and explore the feasibility of a us allogeneic koa clinical study with the fda   cbmg initially plans to use its centralized manufacturing facility located in shanghai to service multiple hospitals within  km of the facility  we aim to complete clinical trials for our koa and cd therapy candidates as soon as practicable our goal is to first obtain regulatory permission for commercial use of the therapies for the respective hospitals in which the trials are being conducted cbmg plans to scale up its customer base by qualifying multiple additional hospitals for the posttrial use of therapies once approved by following regulatory guidelines    with the ag acquisition we intend to monetize ag’s us and chinese intellectual property for immune cell therapy preparation methodologies and patient immunity assessment by engaging with prominent hospitals to conduct preclinical and clinical studies in specific cancer indications the t cell clonality analysis technology patent together with ag’s other knowhow for immunity analysis will enable the company to establish an immunoassay platform that is crucial for immunity evaluation of patients with immune disorders as well as cancerous diseases that are undergoing therapy   we believe that few competitors in china are as wellequipped as we are in the clinical trial development diversified us fda protocol compliant manufacturing facilities regulatory compliance and policy making participation as well as a longterm presence in the us with usbased management and investor base   we intend to continue our business development efforts by adding other proven domestic and international biotechnology partners to monetize the china health care market   in order to expedite fulfillment of patient treatment cbmg has
