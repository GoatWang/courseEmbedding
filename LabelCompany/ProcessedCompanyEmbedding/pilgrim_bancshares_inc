bank as a massachusetts mutual cooperative bank in  the bank changed its name to pilgrim bank   we conduct our operations from our main office and an adjacent operations center in cohasset massachusetts and our two additional fullservice banking offices located in cohasset and marion massachusetts our business consists primarily of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations in one to fourfamily residential real estate commercial real estate multifamily and construction loans and to a lesser extent commercial and industrial and consumer loans we have historically conducted our lending operations with a view towards the specific needs of customers in the communities that we serve measuring our success by customer satisfaction and the extent of our customer relationships rather than on volume based loan origination   market area and competition   our primary market area is the south shore and south coast areas of massachusetts which includes portions of plymouth norfolk and bristol counties we serve customers located in a number of small towns in these areas including cohasset scituate hull hingham norwell marshfield marion mattapoisett plymouth rochester and wareham although our current operations are not focused in boston we are affected by economic conditions in boston because our loan portfolio includes a significant number of loans that are secured by real estate or that have borrowers located in boston in addition a number of our customers who reside in our market area are employed in boston and a number of our nonowner occupied residential and multifamily loan customers have properties in boston as well as in our market area we intend to continue to make loans particularly commercial real estate multifamily nonowner occupied residential and construction loans in boston so we will continue to be affected by economic conditions in boston            competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense in our market area we compete with commercial banks savings institutions mortgage brokerage firms credit unions finance companies mutual funds insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide in addition larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a longterm basis our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area if we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected   lending activities   general as a traditional thrift institution we have historically focused on one to fourfamily owner occupied residential lending including jumbo mortgages and owner occupied construction in recent years we have expanded to include nonowner occupied investment residential commercial real estate multifamily and construction loans and to a lesser extent commercial and industrial and consumer loans subject to market conditions and our assetliability analysis we expect to continue to increase our focus on commercial real estate and multifamily construction and commercial and industrial lending in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans from time to time for purposes of managing interest rate risk we also sell in the secondary market some of the longterm fixedrate residential mortgage loans that we originate generally on a servicingretained nonrecourse basis all of our loan sales to date have been to the federal home loan bank mortgage partnership finance program in addition for purposes of managing interest rate risk generating income and diversifying our portfolio we regularly purchase owner occupied residential real estate loans and consumer loans particularly automobile loans residential real estate loans are purchased on either a servicing released or servicing retained basis these loans are high quality loans and are usually purchased from another bank automobile loans are purchased at  of the outstanding balance and the seller retains  ownership as well as the servicing   loan portfolio composition the following table sets forth the

total does not include  of unfunded commitments            loan approval procedures and authority  pursuant to applicable law the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to  of pilgrim bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus our board of directors has adopted an inhouse limit for loans to one borrower or a group of related borrowers equal to  million   our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower in addition for one to fourfamily residential nonowner occupied residential commercial real estate and multifamily loans we generally obtain an appraisal from an independent licensed appraiser and a secondary review by a separate independent licensed appraiser in certain circumstances where the total loan amount is less than  we may rely on internal valuations or tax assessments in lieu of an independent appraisal all appraisers are approved by our board of directors and the appraisers that we utilize to perform secondary reviews do not perform primary appraisals for us the loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports financial statements and tax returns   lending personnel have approval authority commensurate with their experience and loan performance history loans in excess of any officer’s individual authority and up to the “inhouse limit” established by the board of directors and loans containing any exceptions to our loan policies must be approved by the executive committee which is comprised of our president and chief executive officer and three independent members of our board of directors the executive committee serves as the loan committee loans in excess of the “inhouse limit” must be approved by the board of directors the bank also engages an independent third party to conduct loan reviews on all lending relationships in excess of  million this

real estate loans            one to fourfamily residential real estate lending  the focus of our lending program has historically been the origination of one to fourfamily residential real estate loans at december   we had  million of loans secured by one to fourfamily real estate representing  of our total loan portfolio which includes  million of loans secured by nonowner occupied residential real estate representing  of our total loan portfolio we primarily originate adjustablerate residential mortgage loans but we also offer fixedrate residential mortgage loans and home equity loans at december    million or  of our one to fourfamily residential real estate loans were fixedrate loans and  million or  of such loans were adjustablerate loans   our fixedrate one to fourfamily residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to fhlb mortgage partnership financing program and freddie mac guidelines and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans” we generally originate both fixed and adjustablerate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the federal housing finance agency for freddie mac which as of december   was generally greater than  for singlefamily homes in our market area we also originate owneroccupied residential mortgage loans above the lending limit for conforming loans to borrowers which are referred to as “jumbo loans” generally to borrowers in our market area our jumbo loans are generally adjustablerate loans although we have in the past subject to market and competitive conditions originated longterm fixedrate jumbo loans at december   we had jumbo loans of  million or  of our owner occupied one to fourfamily residential loans and  of our total loans of which  million were originated by pilgrim bank and  million were purchased loans the original balances on these loans were  million of which  million were originated by pilgrim bank and  million were purchased loans   we generally limit the loantovalue ratios of our owneroccupied mortgage loans to  of the sales price or appraised value whichever is lower private mortgage insurance is generally required on all loans with loantovalue ratios above    our fixedrate one to fourfamily residential real estate loans typically have terms of  to  years historically we offered a wide variety of initial terms on our adjustablerate one to fourfamily residential real estate loans however in recent years we have begun offering initial terms of three or five years on our adjustablerate loans in both instances the interest rate adjusts annually at a margin after the initial term our adjustablerate one to fourfamily residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from  to  years our loans on second homes typically have terms of  to  years   recent changes to residential mortgage lending regulations promulgated by the consumer finance protection bureau may have an impact on future mortgage business we intend to underwrite qualified mortgages “qm loans” as defined by the regulations in addition our board of directors has authorized the origination of mortgage loans that qualify for the small creditor exemption based on our market area many of our future residential mortgages will be covered by this exemption we have no plans to issue nonqm loans at this time   we also offer home equity loans second mortgages and lines of credit in both a first and second position at december   we had  million or  of our loan portfolio in home equity lines of credit additionally at december   the unadvanced amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled  million our home equity lines of credit are secured by residential property and generally have terms of fifteen years with a  year draw period and year or year repayment periods we generally do not originate home equity loans or home equity lines of credit unless the loantovalue ratio combined with the first mortgage is less than  our home equity lines of credit are all adjustablerate bearing interest rates based upon the wall street journal prime rate            we may sell a certain amount of the loans we originate into the secondary market during the years ended december   and december   we sold  million and  million of residential mortgage loans respectively at december   we were servicing a portfolio of  million of residential mortgage loans that we had originated and sold see “—originations purchases and sales of loans”   commercial real estate multifamily and nonowner occupied residential lending  consistent with our strategy to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our yield we are focused on increasing our origination of commercial real estate loans with a target loan size of  million to  million at december   we had  million in commercial real estate loans representing  of our total loan portfolio  million in multifamily loans representing  of our total loan portfolio and  million in nonowner occupied residential loans representing  of our total loan portfolio subject to future economic market and regulatory conditions we intend to engage in a disciplined increase in commercial real estate multifamily and nonowner occupied residential lending in our market area   our commercial real estate and multifamily loans are all adjustablerate loans and historically had terms of  years recently as we have endeavored to customize these loans to meet the needs of our customers they generally have initial terms of up to five years and amortization terms of  to  years with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term the maximum loantovalue ratio of our commercial real estate loans and multifamily loans is generally  of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan subject to increase up to  upon the approval of the executive committee our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by retail industrial warehouse service medical or other commercial properties and our multifamily loans are typically secured by five and six unit residential properties or apartment buildings   we also offer mortgages on nonowner occupied or “investment” one to fourfamily residential mortgage loans which we underwrite using the same guidelines and standards applicable to commercial real estate and multifamily loans these loans have terms of five to ten years subject to increase up to  years upon approval of the executive committee we generally limit the loantovalue ratios of nonowner occupied one to fourfamily residential loans to  of the sales price or appraised value whichever is lower subject to an increase to  upon approval of the executive committee these loans are all adjustablerate loans and require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of x   we may hire additional experienced lenders in the future to increase our pipeline of commercial real estate multifamily and investment property loans during  we also offered loans with guarantees through the small business administration “sba”  program we intend to increase this activity in the future the section  program effectively splits one loan into two with pilgrim bank taking the first and the sba taking the second the reduction in loan to value provided under the section  program reduces our credit risk in addition to utilizing the sba  program we are approved as an sba lender we plan to participate in the sba express and sba a program for small business lending we expect to utilize this relationship to support our efforts to diversify our lending into commercial and industrial lending as well as commercial real estate lending   construction and land lending  at december   we had an outstanding balance of  million or  of our total loan portfolio in construction and land loans and  million in unfunded commitments of these  million in outstanding loans and  million in unfunded commitments were for acquisition development and construction loans  million in outstanding loans and  million in unfunded commitments were for nonowner occupied multifamily construction loans  million in outstanding loans and  million in unfunded commitments were for onetofour family speculative construction loans  in outstanding loans and  in unfunded commitments were for commercial real estate investment construction loans  million in outstanding loans and  in unfunded commitments were in onetofour family investment loans  million in outstanding loans and  million in unfunded commitments were for onetofour family owner occupied construction loans and  million in outstanding loans with no unfunded commitments were loans on vacant land            our owneroccupied residential construction loans generally have initial terms of up to  months during which the borrower pays interest only upon completion of construction these loans convert to conventional amortizing mortgage loans our residential construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one to fourfamily residential real estate loans that we originate the maximum loantovalue ratio of our residential construction loans is generally  of the appraised value of the completed property residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential mortgage loans except that all residential construction loans are appraised by independent appraisers and borrowers are generally required to exhibit the ability to absorb unforeseen cost overruns   our commercial real estate multifamily and nonowner occupied residential construction loans generally have initial terms of up to  months depending on the individual project during which the borrower pays interest only multifamily and nonowner occupied residential construction loans are renovation loans or ground up construction loans that either automatically convert to permanent at the end of the construction period or are marketed for sale these loans particularly nonowner occupied residential have been a significant lending opportunity during recent years commercial real estate construction projects are typically land acquisition and development projects of single family units that do not automatically convert to a permanent loan the maximum “as completed” loantovalue for nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans is  however the executive committee has the authority to approve an exception for a higher limit if warranted commercial real estate multifamily and nonowner occupied residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent commercial real estate multifamily and nonowner occupied residential loans all loans are appraised by independent appraisers and subject to a review by a secondary independent appraiser borrowers are generally required to absorb cost overruns and be able to carry the property until it is sold or leased   to a lesser extent we make loans for the speculative construction and development of one to fourfamily residential lots by wellknown established builders in our market area these loans are originated pursuant to the same standards as and generally have terms similar to commercial construction loans the maximum loantovalue ratio of speculative construction and land development loans is generally  land development loans require a  minimum down payment or  where the development is not expected to commence immediately   all construction and land development loans are appraised by independent appraisers all borrowers are required to obtain title insurance property and casualty insurance and if the property is determined to be located in a flood zone area flood insurance either the bank or an independent third party inspects the properties for progress and recommends all draws consistent with the work performed to date all draws are approved by the president and chief executive officer   commercial and industrial lending  at december   we had  million of commercial and industrial loans outstanding representing  of our total loan portfolio and  of unfunded commitments our commercial and industrial loans are generally annual revolving loans but we may also offer term loans with terms of five to ten years depending on the needs of the borrower we make commercial and industrial loans to businesses operating in our market area for purchasing equipment property improvements business expansion or working capital our commercial and industrial term loans are generally secured by equipment furniture and fixtures inventory accounts receivable or other business assets or in very limited circumstances may be unsecured if a commercial and industrial loan is secured by equipment we fix the maturity of a term loan at up to seven years depending on the useful life of equipment purchased the source of repayment for the loan and the purpose of the loan our revolving lines of credit are generally used to finance shortterm working capital needs such as accounts payable and inventory we generally obtain personal guarantees with commercial and industrial loans as of december   we had  of usdaguaranteed agricultural loans            we believe that commercial and industrial loans will provide growth opportunities for us and we expect to increase subject to our conservative underwriting standards and market conditions this business line in the future   consumer lending at december   we had  million or  of our loan portfolio in consumer loans of these  million were automobile loans that we purchased from a local credit union we offer consumer loans on a very limited basis and generally as a convenience to customers with whom we have banking relationships   originations purchases and sales of loans   we originate real estate and other loans through our loan originators employee referrals marketing and advertising efforts our existing customer base walkin customers and referrals from customers real estate brokers builders and attorneys all loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures we may hire additional loan officers and originators to increase our residential lending activity as needed   we may sell a certain amount of the loans we originate into the secondary market based upon our analysis of our interest rate risk and market conditions choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint in recent years we have sold only fixedrate longterm residential mortgages and have sold these loans exclusively to the federal home loan bank in conjunction with its mortgage partnership finance mpf program for the years ended december   and december   we sold  million and  million respectively of mortgage loans all on a servicingretained basis at december   we serviced  million of fixedrate one to fourfamily residential real estate loans that we originated and sold in the secondary market   in addition the purchase of loans or participations in which we are not the lead lender is a key element of our strategy of maintaining a high loantoasset level on our balance sheets when we purchase loans or participations we follow the loan underwriting and approval policies that apply to the origination of the type of loan being purchased during the year ended december   we purchased a total of  million of residential loans on a servicingreleased basis and  million of commercial real estate loans at december   we had  million of participations purchased all of which were secured by real estate or usda guarantees we may also sell participation interests in loans that we originate and retain the servicing and lead position on the credit this generally occurs when a loan or relationship either exceeds our lending limits or we determine that it would be prudent to reduce our credit risk exposure with respect to the particular relationship at december   we had  million of participations sold            the following table sets forth our loan originations purchases and principal repayment activities during

respectively  there were no nonowner occupied residential real estate loans purchased during any period presented   asset quality   delinquency procedures when a borrower fails to make a required monthly payment on any loan in the portfolio we attempt to contact the borrower to determine the reason for nonpayment and to discuss future payments our policies provide that collection procedures commence when a loan is  days past due the executive committee reviews the delinquencies on a monthly basis and reports collection activity to the board   we generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it is  days past due when we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold the real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell and any writedown resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses estimated fair value is based on a new appraisal which is obtained as soon as practicable typically after the foreclosure process is completed subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations after acquisition all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed costs relating to the development and improvement of the property however are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell            troubled debt restructurings during the financial crisis we were aggressive in our efforts to identify borrower weaknesses and to structure modifications to qualified borrowers in order to help them during periods of financial difficulty these modifications were either temporary or permanent borrowers were granted modifications after a detailed analysis of their current financial situation and future expectations we modified loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help a borrower stay current on his or her loan and to avoid foreclosure we generally do not forgive principal on loans or extend the maturity on loans we may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates which may be at below market rates or to provide for temporary interestonly terms or to forgive or defer the payment of interest these modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests since  the bank has modified approximately  loans primarily owneroccupied residential loans some of which did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring during  we modified five loans during  three of the five modified loans paid off following restructuring at december   we had seven remaining loans totaling  million that were designated as troubled debt restructurings two loans designated as troubled debt restructurings were classified as substandard on december   but were contractually performing at that date once the borrower has demonstrated sustained performance with the modified terms the loan may be upgraded from its classified and  or non performing status any loan categorized as a troubled debt restructuring will continue to retain that designation through the life of the loan even if the loan is performing under its original contractual terms            delinquent loans  the following table sets forth

real estate loans at december      or             allowance for loan losses   analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses  our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis when additional allowances are necessary a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings   our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements  specific allowances for identified impaired loans and  a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio   we identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans classified loans and other loans about which management may have concerns about collectability for individually reviewed loans the borrower’s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan as well as the shortfall in collateral value would result in our charging off the loan or the portion of the loan that was impaired   among other factors we consider current general economic conditions including current housing price depreciation in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for our residential real estate portfolio we use evidence obtained from our own loan portfolio as well as published housing data on our local markets from third party sources we believe to be reliable as a basis for assumptions about the impact of housing depreciation   substantially all of our loans are secured by collateral loans  days past due and other classified loans are evaluated for impairment and general or specific allowances are established typically for a nonperforming real estate loan in the process of collection the value of the underlying collateral is estimated using the original independent appraisal or a new appraisal as well as other current estimates of value adjusted for current economic conditions and other factors related general or specific reserves are adjusted on a quarterly basis if a nonperforming real estate loan is in the process of foreclosure andor there are serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest and there is uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral we will order a new independent appraisal any shortfall would result in immediately charging off the portion of the loan that was impaired   specific allowances for identified problem loans  we establish a specific allowance when loans are determined to be impaired loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or for collateraldependent loans the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling expenses factors in identifying a specific problem loan include  the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows  the availability of other sources of repayment  the amount due or past due  the type and value of collateral  the strength of our collateral position  the estimated cost to sell the collateral and  the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency in addition for loans secured by real estate we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage   general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio  we establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as impaired to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities but which unlike specific allowances has not been allocated to particular problem assets this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio the allowance may be adjusted for significant factors that in management’s judgment affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date these significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area credit quality trends collateral value loan volumes and concentrations seasoning of the loan portfolio recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results the applied loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment            allowance for loan

nonperforming loans at december   our allowance for loan losses represented  of total loans and  of nonperforming loans there were  in chargeoffs and  in recoveries during the year ended december   there were  in chargeoffs and no recoveries during the year ended december     although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result furthermore as an integral part of its examination process the massachusetts commissioner of banks and fdic will periodically review our allowance for loan losses the regulators may require that we increase our allowance based on its judgments of information available to it at the time of its examination any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of the operations            securities activities   general  the goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs to help mitigate interest rate and market risk to diversify our assets and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives in recent years beginning with the recession which began in  and the subsequent challenging economic environment our strategy has been to manage the maturities of our investment securities portfolio within our interest rate risk strategies   our board of directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy the investment policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors and our executive committee and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the board of directors authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our president and chief executive officer and our chief financial officer all investment transactions are reviewed at regularly scheduled monthly meetings of the board of directors   us government and agency obligations at december   we had us government and agency securities with a carrying value of  million which constituted  of our securities portfolio while these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio we maintain these investments to the extent appropriate for liquidity purposes as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection   mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  at december   we had mortgagebacked securities with a carrying value of  million which constituted  of our securities portfolio mortgagebacked securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages certain types of mortgagebacked securities are commonly referred to as “passthrough” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors net of certain costs including servicing and guarantee fees mortgagebacked securities typically are collateralized by pools of one to fourfamily or multifamily mortgages although we invest primarily in mortgagebacked securities backed by one to fourfamily mortgages the issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as pilgrim bank the interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees   residential mortgagebacked securities issued by united states government agencies and governmentsponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities in addition residential mortgagebacked securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings investments in residential mortgagebacked securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests thereby affecting the net yield on our securities current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments   municipal securities at december   we had municipal securities with a carrying value of  million which constituted  of our securities portfolio all of our current municipal securities are issued by municipalities in massachusetts and have maturities not in excess of  years these securities generally provide slightly higher yields than us government and agency securities and mortgagebacked securities but are not as liquid as such other investments so we typically maintain investments in municipal securities to the extent appropriate for generating returns in our investment portfolio            investment certificates of deposit with other institutions we invest in certificates of deposit with insured financial institutions in order to increase yields on shortterm investments and manage the maturity of our investment portfolio at december   and  we had  million in certificates of deposit with other institutions   federal home loan bank stock  we held common stock of the federal home loan bank of boston in connection with our borrowing activities totaling  million and  at december   and  respectively the federal home loan bank common stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities we may be required to purchase additional federal home loan bank stock if we increase borrowings in the future   other securities  at december   and  we had  invested in the cooperative central bank reserve fund the cooperative central bank reserve fund is an illiquid investment   bankowned life insurance  we invest in bankowned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations bankowned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is nontaxable at december   and  our balance in bankowned life insurance totaled  million and was issued by one insurance company   securities portfolio composition  the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our

been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities we also use borrowings primarily federal home loan bank of boston advances to supplement cash flow needs lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds in addition we receive funds from scheduled loan payments investment maturities loan prepayments retained earnings and income on earning assets while scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates market conditions and levels of competition to a lesser extent we may utilize repurchase agreements or federal funds sold as funding sources   deposits our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area we offer a selection of deposit accounts including noninterestbearing and interestbearing checking accounts passbook and statement savings accounts variable rate money market accounts and certificates of deposit deposit account terms vary with the principal differences being the minimum balance required the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate we have not in the past used and currently do not hold any internet deposits and we do not accept deposit accounts opened online in  we began to use brokered deposits as a funding source for lending and investment activities we have established an internal policy limit on brokered deposits as the lower of  million or  of total deposits at december   and  brokered deposits totaled  million or  and  of total deposits respectively at december   our core deposits which are deposits other than certificates of deposit were  million representing  of total deposits   in recent years we have relied for deposit generation on promotional programs and advertising efforts our reputation in the community for superior customer service the variety of deposit accounts that we offer our competitive rates customer referrals and crossmarketing efforts with loan customers we may use promotional rates to meet assetliability and market segment goals we intend to continue to focus on increasing our core deposits by providing incentives on new transaction accounts enhanced online services and mobile banking and by leveraging commercial lending relationships to increase transaction accounts   interest rates maturity terms service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates liquidity requirements rates paid by competitors and growth goals the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions changes in interest rates and competition the variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products we believe that deposits are a stable source of funds but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions including competition and prevailing interest rates

company pilgrim bancshares inc is subject to examination and supervision by and is required to file certain reports with the federal reserve board pilgrim bancshares inc is also subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission under the federal securities laws             the regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors the regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes any change in such regulatory requirements and policies whether by the massachusetts legislature the massachusetts commissioner of banks the fdic the federal reserve board or congress could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of pilgrim bancshares inc and pilgrim bank as is further described below the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and may affect the lending investment and general operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies   set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to pilgrim bank and pilgrim bancshares inc this description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on pilgrim bank and pilgrim bancshares inc any change in these laws or regulations whether by congress or the applicable regulatory agencies could have a material adverse impact on pilgrim bancshares inc pilgrim bank and their operations   doddfrank act   the doddfrank act made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies however the doddfrank act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending investments and other operations of all depository institutions the doddfrank act required the federal reserve board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries and the components of tier  capital for holding companies were restricted to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be tier  capital for insured depository institutions the legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon passage and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account offbalance sheet activities and other risks including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives   during  the federal reserve board amended its small bank holding company policy statement the “policy statement” pursuant to the policy statement the basel iii capital rules do not apply to bank holding companies with less than  billion in total assets that meet certain criteria as pilgrim bancshares inc meets the criteria specified in the policy statement the company is not subject to regulatory capital requirements on a consolidated basis   the doddfrank act created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws the consumer financial protection bureau has extensive rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks including the authority to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive” acts and practices the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than  billion in assets banks and savings institutions with  billion or less in assets are still examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators the new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws   the doddfrank act broadened the base for fdic insurance assessments assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution rather than on total deposits the legislation also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor the doddfrank act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and socalled “golden parachute” payments the legislation also directed the federal reserve board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not further the legislation mandated regulations requiring that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans directed the federal reserve board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination             the doddfrank act also required the consumer financial protection board to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination as to a prospective borrower’s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan the final “ability to repay” rules which were effective january   establish a “qualified mortgage” safe harbor for loans whose terms and features are deemed to make the loan less risky   many provisions of the doddfrank act involve delayed effective dates andor require implementing regulations or have not been issued in final form their impact on our operations cannot yet fully be assessed however there is a significant possibility that the doddfrank act will result in an increased regulatory burden and compliance operating and interest expense for pilgrim

assessment rates are based on the institution’s risk category similar to the method currently used to determine assessments by the fdic discussed below under “—federal banking regulation—insurance of deposit accounts”   protection of personal information massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information the requirements are similar to existing federal laws such as the grammleachbliley act that require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft the massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices   massachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed below   federal banking regulation   business activities under federal law all statechartered fdicinsured banks including cooperative banks have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks notwithstanding state law federal law permits exceptions to these limitations for example certain statechartered cooperative banks may with fdic approval continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities

investments if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the fdic insurance fund the fdic has adopted

banks” to meet minimum capital standards a  common equity tier  capital to riskweighted assets ratio a  tier  to riskweighted assets ratio a  tier  capital to total average assets leverage ratio and a  total capital to riskweighted assets ratio   as noted the riskbased capital standard requires the maintenance of common capital also referred to as common equity tier  capital core capital also referred to as tier  capital and total capital which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital to riskweighted assets of   and  respectively in determining the amount of riskweighted assets all assets including certain offbalance sheet exposures are multiplied by a riskweight factor of  to  assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset core or tier  capital is defined as common stockholders’ equity including retained earnings certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships common equity tier  capital adjusts core or tier  capital for several types of

part of total capital cannot exceed  of core capital additionally an institution that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale is required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the purchaser’s recourse against the institution in assessing an institution’s capital adequacy the fdic takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary at december   and  pilgrim bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements   capital rule effective january   with a phasein period of two to four years for certain components the bank became subject to the capital regulations adopted by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” and the fdic which implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and the changes required by the doddfrank act the regulations require a common equity tier  “cet” capital ratio of  a minimum tier  capital to riskweighted assets ratio of  a minimum total capital to riskweighted assets ratio of  and a minimum tier  leverage ratio of  cet generally consists of common stock and retained earnings subject to applicable adjustments and deductions under prompt corrective action regulations in order to be considered “well capitalized” the bank must maintain a cet capital ratio of  and a tier  risk based capital ratio of  a total risk based capital ratio of  and a tier  leverage ratio of  in addition the regulations establish a capital conservation buffer above the required capital ratios that phases in beginning january   at  of riskweighted assets and increases each year by  until it is fully phased in at  effective january   beginning january   failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer limits the ability of the bank and the company to pay dividends repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses   a state nonmember bank may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required by the fdic’s regulatory capital regulations or for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form pilgrim bank’s ability to pay dividends is limited by the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules which limit the ability of pilgrim bancshares inc to pay dividends to its

credit needs of their communities including low and moderateincome borrowers in connection with its examination of a state nonmember bank the fdic is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with the cra the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community consistent with the cra the cra does require the fdic in connection with its examination of a nonmember bank to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions the cra requires the fdic to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s cra performance utilizing a fourtiered descriptive rating system an institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the cra could at a minimum result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers or in restrictions on its activities the cra requires all institutions insured by the fdic to publicly disclose their rating pilgrim bank received a “satisfactory” cra rating in its most recent federal examination   massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the cra that is applicable to pilgrim bank the massachusetts version is generally similar to the cra but utilizes a fivetiered descriptive rating system massachusetts law requires the massachusetts commissioner of banks to consider but not be limited to a bank’s record of performance under massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposittaking facility to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution pilgrim bank’s most recent rating under massachusetts law was “satisfactory”   in addition the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes the failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in enforcement actions by the fdic as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the department of justice   transactions with related parties an institution’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by sections a and b of the federal reserve act and federal regulation an affiliate is generally a company that controls or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as pilgrim bank pilgrim bancshares inc will be an affiliate of pilgrim bank because of its control of pilgrim bank in general transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements transactions with affiliates also must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices generally not involve the purchase of lowquality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with nonaffiliates   pilgrim bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors executive officers and  stockholders as well as to entities controlled by such persons is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the federal reserve act and regulation o of the federal reserve board among other things these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders   · be made on terms that are substantially the same as and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and   · not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate which limits are based in part on the amount of pilgrim bank’s capital            in addition extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by pilgrim bank’s loan committee or board of directors extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved   enforcement the fdic has extensive enforcement responsibility over state nonmember banks and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institutionaffiliated parties” including directors officers stockholders attorneys appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an institution formal enforcement action by the fdic may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers andor directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions and range up to  per day unless a finding of reckless disregard is made in which case penalties may be as high as  million per day the fdic is required with certain exceptions to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state nonmember bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning  days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized” the fdic may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state nonmember bank under specified circumstances including  insolvency  substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices  existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business  insufficient capital or  the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance the fdic also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance   standards for safety and soundness federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions these standards relate to among other things internal controls information systems and audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate risk exposure asset growth compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard if an institution fails to meet these standards the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties   interstate banking and branching federal law permits wellcapitalized and wellmanaged bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state subject to federal reserve board approval certain concentration limits and other specified conditions interstate mergers of banks are also authorized subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions in addition among other things recent amendments made by the doddfrank act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state   prompt corrective action regulations  the fdic is required by law to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital   under prompt corrective action regulations in order to be considered “well capitalized” the bank must maintain a cet capital ratio of  a tier  riskbased capital ratio of  a total riskbased capital ratio of  and a tier  leverage ratio of  an institution that has a cet risk based capital ratio less than  a tier  risk based capital ratio less than  a total risk based capital ratio less than  and a tier  leverage ratio less than  is considered to be undercapitalized an institution that has a cet risk based capital ratio less than  a tier  risk based capital ratio less than  a total risk based capital ratio less than  and a tier  leverage ratio less than  is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized” an institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than  is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” in addition the regulations established a capital conservation buffer above the required capital ratios that phased in beginning january   at  of riskweighted assets and increases each year by  until it is fully phased in at  effective january              generally a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames the regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the fdic within  days of the date that an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” any holding company of an institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of  of the institution’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the fdic or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status this guarantee remains in place until the fdic notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as a restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth the fdic may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors   insurance of deposit accounts the deposit insurance fund of the fdic insures deposits at fdicinsured financial institutions such as pilgrim bank deposit accounts in pilgrim bank are insured by the fdic generally up to a maximum of  per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of  for selfdirected retirement accounts the fdic charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund   under the fdic’s riskbased assessment system insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors rates are based on each institution’s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates assessments are based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity instead of total deposits assessment rates inclusive of possible adjustments currently range from   to  basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital the fdic may increase or decrease the scale uniformly except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking the fdic’s current system represents a change required by the doddfrank act from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits   in addition to the fdic assessments the financing corporation “fico” is authorized to impose and collect with the approval of the fdic assessments for anticipated payments issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the fico in the s to recapitalize the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation the bonds issued by the fico are due to mature in  through  for the quarter ended december   the annualized fico assessment was less than  basis point of total assets less tangible capital   the doddfrank act increased the minimum target deposit insurance fund ratio from  of estimated insured deposits to  of estimated insured deposits the fdic must seek to achieve the  ratio by september   insured institutions with assets of  billion or more are supposed to fund the increase the doddfrank act eliminated the  maximum fund ratio instead leaving it to the discretion of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal deposit insurance corporation has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund of    the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of pilgrim bank management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future            insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic we do not currently know of any practice condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance   prohibitions against tying arrangements  state nonmember banks are prohibited subject to some exceptions from extending credit to or offering any other service or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution   federal reserve system federal reserve board regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterestearning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts the federal reserve board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating  million or less which may be adjusted by the federal reserve board the reserve requirement is  and the amounts greater than  million require a  reserve which may be adjusted annually by the federal reserve board between  and  the first  million of otherwise reservable balances which may be adjusted by the federal reserve board are exempted from the reserve requirements pilgrim bank is in compliance with these requirements   federal home loan bank system pilgrim bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system which consists of  regional federal home loan banks the federal home loan bank system provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending as a member of the federal home loan bank of boston pilgrim bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the federal home loan bank as of december   pilgrim bank was in compliance with this requirement based on redemption provisions of the federal home loan bank of boston the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost pilgrim bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the federal home loan bank of boston stock as of december   no impairment has been recognized   at its discretion the federal home loan bank of boston may declare dividends on its stock the federal home loan banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late s and to contributing funds for affordable housing programs these requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the federal home loan banks pay to their members and result in the federal home loan banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members as a result of losses incurred the federal home loan bank of boston suspended and did not pay dividends in  and  however the federal home loan bank of boston resumed payment of quarterly dividends in  equal to an annual yield of  and continued to pay quarterly dividends in  equal to an annual yield of  in  equal to an annual yield of  in  equal to an annual yield of  in  equal to an annual yield of  and in  equal to an annual yield of  there

insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary institution becomes undercapitalized the policy statement also states that a bank holding company should inform the federal reserve board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption

investors understand the financial performance of pilgrim bancshares inc and its subsidiaries through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at december   and december   and our results of operations for the years ended december   and december   this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k   critical accounting policies   certain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition since they require management to make difficult complex or subjective judgments some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include but are not limited to changes in interest rates changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k            the recently enacted jobs act contains provisions that among other things reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies as an “emerging growth company” we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies accordingly our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements management currently views the determination of the allowance for loan losses and deferred tax assets to be critical accounting policies   allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged to income determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans value of collateral and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change management reviews the level of the allowance quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio past loss experience current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation in addition bank regulators as an integral part of their examination process periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance which would adversely affect earnings   deferred tax assets  we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets which are inherently subjective are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets   comparison of financial condition at december   and december     total assets total assets increased  million or  to

assetliability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income our primary source of earnings   over the past several years management has implemented an assetliability strategy to manage subject to our profitability goals our interest rate risk among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are   · originating commercial real estate multifamily and construction loans all of which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one to fourfamily residential real estate loans and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger noninterest bearing checking accounts   · selectively selling the majority of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that we originate and retaining all of the adjustablerate residential real estate loans that we originate   · lengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longerterm wholesale funding sources such as fixedrate advances from the federal home loan bank of boston   · increasing our generation of core deposits to support lending and investment activity            · investing in shorter to mediumterm investment securities and   · increasing noninterest income as a percentage of total income to decrease our reliance on net interest margin and interest rate spread   our board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our assetliability committee  this c ommittee is charged with developing and implementing an assetliability management plan and meets at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk we currently utilize a thirdparty modeling program prepared on a quarterly basis to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates given our business strategy operating environment capital liquidity and performance objectives and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors in addition we regularly perform a “gap analysis” of the discrepancy between the repricing of our assets and liabilities   net interest income analysis we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model which is provided to us by an independent third party net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interestearning assets such as loans and securities and the interest we pay on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings we estimate what our net interest income would be for a oneyear period based on current interest rates we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions we also estimate the impact over a two year time horizon the following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the oneyear period beginning january   resulting from potential changes in interest rates the model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from bp to bp although we believe a decline of greater than bp is currently improbable these estimates require certain assumptions to be made including loan and mortgagerelated investment prepayment speeds reinvestment rates and deposit maturities and decay rates these assumptions are inherently uncertain as a result no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results   rate shift      net interest income year  forecast     year  change from level           dollars in thousands

shock of the static yield curve   certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities the tables also do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes in general interest rates accordingly although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity and will differ from actual results            net present value of equity analysis in order to monitor and manage interest rate risk we also use the net present value of equity at risk “npv” methodology this methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities the comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve in increments of  basis point bp rate movements a basis point equals onehundredth of one percent and  basis points equals one percent an increase in interest rates from  to  would mean for example a  basis point increase in the “change in interest rates” column below the model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from bp to bp because a decline of greater than bp is currently improbable the board of directors and management review the methodology’s measurements on a quarterly basis   the interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management’s view of future market movements results of the modeling are used to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may influence our earnings modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is decidedly reliant on numerous assumptions embedded in the model these assumptions include but are not limited to management’s best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates these assumptions are inherently changeable and as a result the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rate on net interest income actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions assumptions are supported with annual back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts   the table below sets forth as of december   the estimated changes in the net present value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the united states treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for pilgrim bank computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates loan prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results   at december                 estimated

to changes in a forecast interest rate environment  eve ratio represents economic value of equity divided by the economic value of assets which should translate into built in stability for future earnings   the table above indicates that at december   in the event of an instantaneous parallel  basis point decrease in interest rates we would experience a  increase in net portfolio value in the event of an instantaneous  basis point increase in interest rates we would experience a  decrease in net portfolio value            depending on the relationship between longterm and shortterm interest rates market conditions and consumer preference we may place greater emphasis on maximizing our net interest margin than on strictly matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities we believe that the increased net income which may result from an acceptable mismatch in the actual maturity or repricing of our assets and liabilities can during periods of declining or stable interest rates provide sufficient returns to justify an increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates we believe that our level of interest rate risk is acceptable using this approach   we do not engage in hedging activities such as engaging in futures options or swap transactions or investing in highrisk mortgage derivatives such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities   liquidity and capital resources   our primary sources of funds are deposits principal and interest payments on loans and securities proceeds from the sale of loans proceeds from maturities and calls of securities maturities of certificate of deposit investments and federal home loan bank advances while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates economic conditions and competition our most liquid assets are cash and shortterm investments including interestbearing demand deposits the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating financing lending and investing activities during any given period   our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million and  million for the years ended december   and december   respectively net cash used in investing activities which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations the purchase of securities and the purchase of time deposits with other banks offset by principal collections on loans proceeds from the sale of securities proceeds from redemption of time deposits and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgagebacked securities was  million and  million for the years ended december   and december   respectively during the year ended december   we purchased  million and sold  million in securities held as availableforsale and during the year ended december   we purchased  million and sold  in securities held as availableforsale net cash provided by financing activities consisting of the activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances for  and  was  million and  million for the years ended december   and december   respectively   at december   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized with a tier  leverage capital level of  million or  of average assets which is above the required level of  million or  and total riskbased capital of  million or  of riskweighted assets which is above the required level of  million or  management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category   at december   we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of  million and unadvanced funds on loans of  million we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from december   totaled  million management expects based on historical experience that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed however if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained we may utilize federal home loan bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts which may result in higher levels of interest expense            offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations we engage in a variety of financial transactions that in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements these transactions involve to varying degrees elements of credit interest rate and liquidity risk such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments lines of credit and standby letters of credit   we have not engaged in any other offbalance sheet transactions

and subsidiary   notes to consolidated financial statements   for the years ended december   and    note   nature of operations   pilgrim bancshares inc the “company” was incorporated in february  under the laws of the state of maryland the company owns all of the outstanding shares of common stock of pilgrim bank the “bank” the bank is a massachusetts chartered stock bank which was incorporated in  and is headquartered in cohasset massachusetts the bank operates its business from three banking offices located in massachusetts the bank is engaged principally in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits in residential and commercial real estate loans and in commercial consumer and small business loans the bank is subject to the regulations of and periodic examination by the massachusetts division of banks “dob” and the federal deposit insurance corporation “the fdic”   note   accounting policies   the accounting and reporting policies of the company and its subsidiary conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and predominant practices within the banking industry the consolidated financial statements were prepared using the accrual basis of accounting the significant accounting policies are summarized below to assist the reader in better understanding the consolidated financial statements and other data contained herein   use of estimates   in preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of deferred tax assets   basis of presentation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiary the bank and the bank’s whollyowned subsidiaries  south main street corporation which was formed to hold securities for its own account  south main street realty trust which was formed to hold our main office and  cjc realty corporation which was formed to invest in and develop residential and commercial property all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of reporting cash flows cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand cash items due from banks and interestbearing demand deposits with other banks   the bank is required to maintain average balances on hand or with the federal reserve bank at december   and  these reserve balances amounted to  and  respectively   securities   investments in debt securities are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts so as to approximate the interest method gains or losses on sales of investment securities are computed on a specific identification basis     f        the company classifies debt and equity securities into one of three categories heldtomaturity availableforsale or trading these security classifications may be modified after acquisition only under certain specified conditions in general securities may be classified as heldtomaturity only if the company has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity trading securities are defined as those bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term all other securities must be classified as availableforsale   — heldtomaturity securities are measured at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheets unrealized holding gains and losses are not included in earnings or in a separate component of stockholders’ equity they are merely disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements   — availableforsale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized holding gains and losses are not included in earnings but are reported as a net amount less expected tax in a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized   — trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities are included in earnings   for any debt security with a fair value less than its amortized cost basis the company will determine whether it has the intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis if either condition is met the company will recognize a full impairment charge to earnings for all other debt securities that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired and do not meet either condition the credit loss portion of impairment will be recognized in earnings as realized losses the otherthantemporary impairment related to all other factors will be recorded in other comprehensive income   declines in marketable equity securities below their cost that are deemed other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses   federal home loan bank stock   the company is required to own shares of capital stock in the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb in order to borrow from the fhlb the stock is carried at its cost and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the fhlb stock   loans   loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balances adjusted for amounts due borrowers on unadvanced loans any chargeoffs the allowance for loan losses and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans or unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans   interest on loans is recognized on a simple interest basis   loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and the net amount amortized as an adjustment of the related loans yield the company is amortizing these amounts over the contractual lives of the related loans   residential real estate loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when reaching  days past due or in process of foreclosure all closedend consumer loans  days or more past due and any equity line in the process of foreclosure are placed on nonaccrual status secured consumer loans are written down to realizable value and unsecured consumer loans are charged off upon reaching  or  days past due depending on the type of loan commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans and leases which are  days or more past due are generally placed on nonaccrual status unless secured by sufficient cash or other assets immediately convertible to cash when a loan has been placed on nonaccrual status previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest on loans a loan can be returned to accrual status when collectibility of principal is reasonably assured and the loan has performed for a period of time generally six months     f        cash receipts of interest income on impaired loans are credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan some or all of the cash receipts of interest income on impaired loans are recognized as interest income if the remaining net carrying amount of the loan is deemed to be fully collectible when recognition of interest income on an impaired loan on a cash basis is appropriate the amount of income that is recognized is limited to that which would have been accrued on the net carrying amount of the loan at the contractual interest rate any cash interest payments received in excess of the limit and not applied to reduce the net carrying amount of the loan are recorded as recoveries of chargeoffs until the chargeoffs are fully recovered   allowance for loan losses   the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance   the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience the nature and volume of the loan portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available   general component   the general component of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by the following loan segments residential real estate commercial real estate multifamily real estate home equity loans and lines of credit construction commercial and industrial and consumer management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on a time frame appropriate to capture relevant loss data for each loan segment this historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors levelstrends in delinquencies and underlying collateral values trends in volume and terms of loans effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies procedures and practices experienceabilitydepth of lending management and staff and national and local economic trends and conditions there were no changes in the company’s policies or methodology pertaining to the general component of the allowance for loan losses during the years ended december   and    the qualitative factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows   residential real estate the company generally does not originate loans with a loantovalue ratio greater than  percent and does not grant subprime loans loans in this segment are primarily collateralized by owneroccupied residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower the overall health of the economy including unemployment rates and housing prices will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment   commercial and multifamily real estate loans in this segment are primarily incomeproducing properties throughout eastern massachusetts specifically the south shore the underlying cash flows generated by the properties are adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates which in turn will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment management periodically obtains rent rolls and continually monitors the cash flows of these loans   construction loans loans in this segment include land speculative residential properties investment multifamily rehab to permanent investment properties and owner occupied residential properties payment is derived from sale of the property or long term rental cash flows once converted to permanent financing credit risk is affected by cost overruns time to sell at an adequate price vacancies and market conditions   commercial and industrial loans loans in this segment are made to businesses are generally secured by assets of the business and are primarily guaranteed by the united states government repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business a weakened economy and resultant decreased consumer spending will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment     f        consumer loans loans in this segment are primarily secured by automobiles and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower   allocated component   the allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and industrial commercial and multifamily real estate and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value of the impaired loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment accordingly the company does not separately identify individual consumer home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans for impairment disclosures unless such loans are subject to a troubled debt restructuring agreement   a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower including the length of the delay the reasons for the delay the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed   the company periodically may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans on a temporary or permanent basis when a loan is modified and a concession is made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr all tdrs are initially classified as impaired   unallocated component   an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio   premises and equipment and investment in real estate   land is stated at cost premises investment in real estate and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization cost and related allowances for depreciation and amortization of premises investment in real estate and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the respective accounts with any gain or loss included in income or expense depreciation and amortization are calculated principally on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets useful lives are dependent upon the nature and condition of the asset and range from three years to  years   premises and equipment and investment in real estate are periodically evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows of premises and equipment and investment in real estate are less than their carrying amounts in that event the company records a loss of the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset based on quoted market prices if applicable or a discounted cash flow analysis   other real estate owned and insubstance foreclosures   other real estate owned includes properties acquired through foreclosure and properties classified as insubstance foreclosures in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  “receivables  troubled debt restructurings by creditors these properties are initially recorded at their estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of foreclosure or transfer establishing a new cost basis subsequent to foreclosure or transfer valuations are periodically performed by management and assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell any writedown from cost to estimated fair value required at the time of foreclosure or classification as an insubstance foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses expenses incurred in connection with maintaining these assets subsequent writedowns and gains or losses recognized upon sale are included in other expense     f        the company classifies commercial loans as insubstance repossessed or foreclosed if the company receives physical possession of the debtor’s assets regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings take place an insubstance repossession or foreclosure occurs and the company is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan upon either  obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or  the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the company to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement   bankowned life insurance   the company has purchased insurance policies on the lives of certain directors executive officers and employees bankowned life insurance policies are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at cash surrender value changes in net cash surrender value of the policies as well as insurance proceeds received are reflected in noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income and are not subject to income taxes   advertising   the company directly expenses costs associated with advertising as they are incurred   employee stock ownership plan   compensation expense for the employee stock ownership plan “esop” is recorded at an amount equal to the shares allocated by the esop multiplied by the average fair value of the shares during the period the company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the year based upon the company’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the esop unearned compensation applicable to the esop is reflected as a reduction of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet the difference between the average fair value and the cost of shares allocated by the esop is recorded as an adjustment to additional paidin capital   stock based compensation   the company recognizes stockbased compensation on the grantdate fair value of the award adjusted for expected forfeitures the company values sharebased stock option awards granted using the blackscholes optionpricing model the company recognizes compensation expense for its awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award straightline attribution method ensuring that the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equals the portion of the grantdate fair value of the award that is vested at that time   income taxes   the company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the companys assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled   it is the company’s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities as of december   and  there were no material uncertain tax positions related to federal and state income tax matters the company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the internal revenue service and state taxing authorities for the years ended december   through december   interest and penalties if any are recorded as income tax expense     f        fair values of financial instruments   asc  “financial instruments” requires that the company disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments fair value methods and assumptions used by the company in estimating its fair value disclosures are as follows   cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets fair values   interestbearing time deposits with other banks the fair value of interestbearing time deposits with other banks was determined by discounting the cash flows associated with these instruments using current market rates for deposits with similar characteristics   securities fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments   loans receivable for variablerate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk fair values are based on carrying values the fair values for other loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality   accrued interest receivable the carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value   deposit liabilities the fair values disclosed for demand deposits regular savings now accounts and money market accounts are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date ie their carrying amounts fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits   federal home loan bank advances fair values for federal home loan bank advances are estimated using a discounted cash flow technique that applies interest rates currently being offered on advances to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on federal home loan bank advances   offbalance sheet instruments the fair value of commitments to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties for fixedrate loan commitments and the unadvanced portion of loans fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates   earnings per share eps   the company has adopted the eps guidance included in asc  as presented below basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity for purposes of computing diluted eps the treasury stock method is used   unallocated esop shares and unearned shares of restricted stock are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations     f        eps for the years ended december   and  have been computed based on the following       years ended december                net income in thousands                               basic and diluted common shares                 weighted

defined in title  of jumpstart our business startups jobs act the company has elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies accordingly the consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards as of december   there is no significant difference in the comparability of the consolidated financial statements as a result of this extended transition period   in may  and august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ” the objective of this asu is to clarify principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards the guidance in asu  affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards the core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company the amendments in asu  defer the effective date of asu  to annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within that period earlier application is permitted only as of an annual reporting period beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements   in may  the fasb issued asu  “fair value measurement topic   disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent” the objective of this update is to address the diversity in practice related to how certain investments measured at net asset value with redemption dates in the future are categorized within the fair value hierarchy the amendments in this update remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient the amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient rather those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements     f        in january  the fasb issued asu  “financial instruments – overall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” the amendments in this asu address certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments and makes targeted improvements to gaap as follows    require equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income however an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same manner  simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment when a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value  eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet  require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes  require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrumentspecific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments  require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets that is securities or loans and receivables on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements  clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to availableforsale securities in combination with the entity’s other deferred tax assets   under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december   early application of item  above is permitted for fiscal years or interim periods for which financial statements

consolidated financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu  “leases topic ” this asu was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring reporting entities to recognize all leases including operating as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements under the extended transition period for

anticipates that the adoption of this asu will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in march  the fasb issued asu  “compensationstock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” the asu simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment award transactions including a income tax consequences b classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and c classification on the statement of cash flows under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company the amendments in this asu are effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within annual periods beginning after december   the company is currently reviewing this asu to determine if it will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements     f        in june  the fasb issued asu no  “financial instruments – credit losses topic  measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” the asu requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts financial institutions and other organizations will now use forwardlooking information to better inform their credit loss estimates many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses organizations will continue to use judgement to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances additionally the asu amends the accounting for credit losses on availableforsale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company this update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted in interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   the company is currently evaluating the amendments of asu no  to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the company’s consolidated financial statements   in august  the fasb issued asu  “classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” current gaap is unclear or does not include specific guidance on how to classify certain transactions in the statement of cash flows this asu is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how eight particular transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company the amendments in asu  are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period entities will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively if it is impracticable to apply the guidance retrospectively for an issue the amendments related to that issue would be applied prospectively as this guidance only affects the classification within the statement of cash flows asu  is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements   in november  the fasb issued asu  “statement of cash flows – restricted cash topic ” the amendments in this update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents therefore amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the amendments in this update do not provide a definition of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within fiscal

internal loan rating system for commercial and multifamily real estate construction and commercial loans as follows   loans rated    loans in these categories are considered “pass” rated loans with low to average risk   loans rated  loans in this category are considered “special mention” these loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by management   loans rated  loans in this category are considered “substandard” generally a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors andor the collateral pledged there is a distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected   loans rated  loans in this category are considered “doubtful” loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts highly questionable and improbable   loans rated  loans in this category are considered uncollectible “loss” and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted   on an annual basis or more often if needed the company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial and multifamily real estate construction and commercial loans for residential real estate home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans the company initially assesses credit quality based upon the borrower’s ability to pay and subsequently monitors these loans based on the borrower’s payment activity   the company classifies loans modified as tdrs as impaired loans with an allowance established as part of the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses when

activities   the company is a party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers these financial instruments

contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the company has in particular classes of financial instruments     f        the company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for onbalance sheet instruments   commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee the company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a casebycase basis the amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation of the

company shall pay certain minimum monthly charges as defined in the agreement as well as charges for any additional services provided   note   fair value measurements   asc  “fair value measurement  overall” provides a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles this guidance also allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contractbycontract basis   in accordance with asc  the company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in three levels based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value     f        level   valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets such as the new york stock exchange level  also includes us treasury other us government and agency mortgagebacked securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active markets valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities   level   valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer or broker markets valuations are obtained from third party pricing services for identical or comparable assets or liabilities   level   valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other methodologies including option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques are not based on market exchange dealer or broker traded transactions level  valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets and liabilities   a financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement   a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy is set forth below these valuation methodologies were applied to all of the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value as of december   and  the company did not have any significant transfers between level  and level  of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended december     the company’s investment in mortgagebacked securities and other debt securities availableforsale is generally classified within level  of the fair value hierarchy for these securities we obtain fair value measurements from independent pricing services the fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes market spreads cash flows the us treasury yield curve trading levels market consensus prepayment speeds credit information and the instrument’s terms and conditions   level  is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity andor nontransferability and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence management’s best estimate is used subsequent to inception management only changes level  inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments completed or pending thirdparty transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities subsequent rounds of financing recapitalization and other transactions across the capital structure offerings in the equity or debt markets and changes in financial ratios or cash flows   the company’s impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral collateral values are estimated using level  inputs based upon appraisals of similar properties obtained from a third party for level  inputs fair value is based upon management estimates of the value of the underlying collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows     f        the following summarizes assets measured at fair value on a recurring
