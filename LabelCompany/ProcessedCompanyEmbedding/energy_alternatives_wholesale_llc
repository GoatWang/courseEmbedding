related tests these tests and inspections are conducted in the heating and cooling equipment area of your house carbon monoxide tests we look for excess carbon monoxide in the flue gases of your heating appliances and in the air of your house drafting tests an evaluation of the risk that the combustion gases in building’s flues will be pulled back into your house by a source of negative pressure combustion efficiency test a measurement of the efficiency of your heating system a higher number means that more of the energy goes into your house flue inspection an examination of your combustion equipment flue pipes for blockages or other hazardous conditions hvac equipment inspection  a visual inspection examines the overall condition of your heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment duct air flow estimate this test estimates the amount of air moving through your duct system too little air movement in your ducts will affect the comfort and efficiency of your heating andor cooling system  health and durability inspections moisture sources and damage as part of a walk through of the house your inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of high humidity or moisture damage indoor air pollution sources also as part of a walk through of the house your inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of potential sources of indoor air pollution house durability inspection the inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of maintenance problems affecting the durability of your house insulation and envelope inspection an examination and measurement of the insulation levels in various areas of your building’s “shell” roof and attic inspection the inspector examines the roof and attic for evidence of maintenance problems exhaust fan duct condition finally as part of a walkthrough of the house your inspector examines the condition of your exhaust fan ductwork for length and condition too long of a duct run can cause moisture problems and leaky exhaust ducts can put damaging amounts of moisture into your house  whole house performance tests exhaust fan flow this test measures the ability of your exhaust fan systems to remove air from your house not enough airflow means the fan is making noise but not moving air blower door test a comprehensive test measures the leakiness of your house the building is pressurized and depressurized and a measurement of air leakage is performed duct leakage a similar test that measures the leakiness of your duct system pressure mapping this test helps to determine the unintentional air flows that occur when the heating and cooling fan is on a second test looks at the unintentional connectedness of various spaces such as attics basements and garages to your house

results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach what is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free we’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up

different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting both for location and for devices computer mobile and tablet make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history you may be able to win a good
