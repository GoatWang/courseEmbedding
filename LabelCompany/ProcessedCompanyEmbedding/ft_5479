disease strategies to maintain wild populations and control chytridiomycosis frontiers in zoology   background rescuing amphibian diversity is an achievable conservation challenge disease mitigation is one essential component of population management here we assess existing disease mitigation strategies some in early experimental stages which focus on the globally emerging chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis we discuss the precedent for each strategy in systems ranging from agriculture to human medicine and the outlook for each strategy in terms of research needs and longterm potential results we find that the effects of exposure to batrachochytrium dendrobatidis occur on a spectrum from transient commensal to lethal pathogen management priorities are divided between  halting pathogen spread and developing survival assurance colonies and  prophylactic or remedial disease treatment epidemiological models of chytridiomycosis suggest that mitigation strategies can control disease without eliminating the pathogen ecological ethics guide wildlife disease research but several ethical questions remain for managing disease in the field conclusions because sustainable conservation of amphibians in nature is dependent on longterm population persistence and coevolution with potentially lethal pathogens we suggest that disease mitigation not focus exclusively on the elimination or containment of the pathogen or on the captive breeding of amphibian hosts rather successful disease mitigation must be context specific with epidemiologically informed strategies to manage already infected populations by decreasing pathogenicity and host susceptibility we propose population level treatments based on three steps first identify mechanisms of disease suppression second parameterize epizootiological models of disease and population dynamics for testing under seminatural conditions and third begin a process of adaptive management in field trials with natural populations related projects title completion year investigator southern rocky mountain amphibian research and monitoring initiative armi  erin muths wyoming toad at mortenson lake
