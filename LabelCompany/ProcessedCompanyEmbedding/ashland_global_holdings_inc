 keybanc capital markets inc operator good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the ashland global holdings inc second quarter earnings call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session and instructions will be given at that time as a reminder this call is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to mr seth mrozek you may begin seth a mrozek  ashland global holdings inc thank you michelle good morning everyone and welcome to ashlands second quarter fiscal  earnings conference call and webcast my name is seth mrozek director ashland investor relations joining me on the call today are bill wulfsohn ashlands chairman and chief executive officer and kevin willis senior vice president and chief financial officer we released preliminary results for the quarter ended march   at approximately  pm eastern time yesterday april  additionally we posted slides and prepared remarks to our website ashlandcom under the investor relations section and have furnished each of these documents to the sec in a form k as a reminder some of the matters discussed toady and included in our presentations may include forwardlooking statements as such term is defined under us securities law we believe any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions but cannot assure that such expectations will be achieved please also note that we will be discussing adjusted results during this call we believe this enhances the understanding of our performance by more accurately reflecting our ongoing business with that i will turn the call over to bill bill william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc thank you seth and good morning everyone yesterday was a momentous day as we announced the final step in the valvoline separation and as you may have read on may  just a few weeks away we will be distributing all of ashlands remaining interest in valvoline to ashland shareholders this represents the final step in our journey to create two great companies both positioned for success with the flexibility strategic focus and financial resources needed to generate revenue and earnings growth it also represents the beginning of exciting new chapters for both the new ashland and valvoline from a new ashland perspective we are focused on ashlands two core priorities for the year the first is to position ashland to deliver against our fiscal year  plan and the second core priority is to pivot ashland to reach its full potential as the premier specialty chemical company id like to first speak to the subject of building the premier specialty chemical company as a core part of that objective it relates to continuing to upgrade and enhance our portfolio and to that end last month we announced an agreement to acquire pharmachem laboratories a leading provider of quality ingredients to the global health and wellness industry with highvalued differentiated products offered also to fragrance and flavor houses with this acquisition we see a number of exciting growth opportunities as it will strengthen our specialty product portfolio particularly in highmargin end markets it also enhances our position in fast growing nutraceutical end markets it opens new opportunities within flavors and fragrance and it strengthens ashlands food ingredients business by adding customized functional solutions we believe that by combining pharmachem and ashland we can leverage our extensive sales channels technical service network and global application labs to accelerate pharmachems growth while also generating significant cash flow we expect to complete this transaction by the end of june and look forward to welcoming pharmachems talented employees to the ashland team returning now to our performance in the quarter ashlands overall financial performance reflects significant progress in a number of key areas within ashlands specialty ingredients the team delivered volume growth of approximately  sales were up  to  million driven by increased sales in most of asis key end markets consumer specialties grew  yearoveryear in sales with the strongest growth coming from personal care and it is important to note that the personal care team generated strong results across all of their end markets this quarter in pharma the team worked to optimize our sales mix and to be more specific what were doing is were migrating production assets away from lower margin products to higher margin products and next week when we meet at our investor day were going to speak more to this type of product mix upgrade activity within asis industrial division the team drove strong volume gains across all of their end markets and from a regional perspective asi saw strong customer demand in china its important to note the team also did a great job in controlling sga which was down in asi by about  million yearoveryear now despite these gains overall asi ebitda was flat versus prior year and that was due to negative impact of rising raw materials and currency in the quarter later in the call im going to speak to the actions asi is taking to sustain revenue growth while improving its profit trajectory moving now to ashlands performance materials the team delivered sales of  million which represents a  increase over the same period prior year and adjusted ebitda was  million which was consistent with the outlook provided at the beginning of the quarter this was a good result and a good outcome as the composite team generated  volume growth during the quarter driven by solid demand from customers in north america and china and id like to note that shortly after our january earnings call a major supplier of one of our key raw materials for composite styrene announced a force majeure which resulted in dramatic cost increases the composites teams responded quickly and aggressively and their first priority was to ensure continuity of supply to their customers and at the same time the composites teams focused on driving price increases to offset these increases in raw material costs both of these efforts were successful although there is a lag in the quarter between the timing of raw material price increases which were immediate and finished good pricing which followed  days to  days later and that did have a negative impact on composites margins in q netnet the composites business drove  sales growth which was more than offset by the increased raw material pricing in the quarter the good news is that based upon the price increases put in place the impact of raw material inflation in composites is expected to be fully offset in the second half of our fiscal year moving to the intermediates and solvents portion of apm the intermediates and solvents team grew volume by  and sales by  as improved demand offset substantially lower selling prices as anticipated is earnings were below the prior year bdo pricing was down versus last year the good news is that during the quarter the is team increased prices substantially and now expects yearoveryear pricing to more than offset raw material inflation in the second half of the year and we are optimistic that this is the beginning of the market recovery weve been anticipating for some time finally moving to valvoline this will be the last quarter that well be referencing valvolines performance and i encourage you to read their earnings release where they profile good gains in lubricant sales on both sales and gallons basis id like to congratulate the valvoline team on another strong quarter but more specifically thank the team for all their many contributions to ashland over the years ill now turn the call over to kevin to discuss some corporate items j kevin willis  ashland global holdings inc thank you bill and good morning everyone in the quarter we reported gaap earnings from continuing operations attributable to ashland of  per diluted share when adjusted for key items earnings per share attributable to ashland were  and adjusted ebitda was  million while these amounts are below the prior year remember that they do not include the valvoline net income attributable to ashlands noncontrolling  interest which totaled  per share on a diluted basis a year ago and  million of adjusted ebitda as bill just mentioned asi delivered sales and volume growth and overall apm earnings were consistent with our outlook as both composites and is delivered solid volume growth with respect to pharmachem and the balance sheet as bill just mentioned we expect to close the transaction by the end of the june quarter we intend to finance the transaction through a combination of bank debt and cash on the balance sheet we expect the incremental interest expense to be approximately  million per year and paying down debt will be our primary use of free cash flow until we achieve our targeted leverage ratio of  times gross debt to ebitda based on current projections we think it will take a couple of years to reach that target furthermore ashlands liquidity remains strong as of march  and excluding valvoline we had cash and borrowing capacity of nearly  billion our effective tax rate for the second quarter after adjusting for key items was  this was below our estimate of  to  due primarily to discrete items and income mix during the quarter for the third quarter of fiscal  ashland expects an adjusted annual effective tax rate of  to  reflecting ashlands global footprint and the full separation of valvoline in looking at cash taxes we estimate that post separation ashlands cash tax rate would land in the low to mid  range the biggest difference between the book and cash tax rate is related to intangibles that run through the effective tax rate but are not deductible for cash tax purposes however cash taxes will also be influenced by income mix and discrete items not unlike the book tax rate our current estimate for free cash flow excluding valvoline for fiscal  is now  million to  million including  million to  million of onetime separation and severance related payments the reduction is being driven primarily by investments into working capital related to the increase in raw material costs we should get this back through pricing actions over the course of time while the team is working to mitigate these effects it will take some time to do so now ill turn the call back over to bill william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc thank you kevin turning now to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year  within asi we see continued sales growth in the second half of the year for the third quarter asi sales are expected to be in the range of  million to  million the team is working hard to offset raw material inflation which is expected to represent approximately  million of incremental cost in q and  million for the second half of the fiscal year more specifically the team is working to accelerate sales of new product introductions such as endurance which well talk about next week at our investor day but was recently recognized with the gold medal at the incosmetics show the team is also reducing sga spending and more specifically theyre working to realize the impact of our pricetovalue initiatives which well also discuss next week at our investor day as a result we estimate asis adjusted ebitda in q to be roughly equal to prior year which is at the center of our outlook range beginning in q we expect to see the positive impact of pharmachem which could be in q  million to  million with this addition for the full year we are narrowing our outlook range for asi adjusted ebitda to  million to  million for apm we expect to see the result of our pricing initiatives having a positive impact in the quarter apm expects third quarter sales to be in the range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda in the range of  million to  million versus  million in the yearago period perhaps more importantly we are increasing our fullyear apm forecast and now expect fullyear ebitda for the segment to be in the range of  million to  million before leaving apm id like to make a quick note on another acquisition we announced earlier this month in early april ashland announced that we have made a binding offer to acquire a composites resin manufacturing facility in etain france from reichhold this facility manufactures unsaturated polyester resins or upr and theyre used in a variety of end markets such as transportation and construction and the transaction which is expected to be completed by the end of june is really a unique opportunity for us to strengthen our cost competitiveness and position the european composites market at a highly attractive price with very compelling terms and conditions related to the purchase so now in summary thus far this fiscal year we have really made some great progress in key areas i think yesterdays separate announcement that ashland will be distributing all of its remaining interest in valvoline to ashland shareholders on may  represents an important and final step in our journey to create two companies within asi we are driving sales and volume growth in the majority of our key end markets and we must build on that momentum in the second half of the year and fully offset raw material inflation with pricing actions within apm both the composites and is teams have raised prices already to help offset the expected impact of raw material inflation in the second half of  and its worth noting that weve also been taking aggressive actions across the globe to hold our yearoveryear sga constant through various cost savings initiatives now we have a lot more to share with you about our strategies and performance targets when we hold our investor day next monday and i encourage you to attend or participate via webcast thank you for your interest in ashland and i will now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from laurence alexander of jefferies your line is open jeffrey schnell  jefferies llc hi good morning this is jeff schnell on for laurence william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc good morning jeffrey schnell  jefferies llc good morning if i take the midpoint of the ebitda range for asi at  million and performance materials at  million take out corporate overhead of  million layer in pharmachem at say  million and adjust for restructuring to fully offset costs related to this spin is it fair to peg that ebitda floor for building a bridge to  at roughly  million before allowing for organic growth and fx and as a followon what core competency does pharmachem give you or is it more of a matter of a broader distribution channel thank you j kevin willis  ashland global holdings inc ill take the first question i think its too early to actually be talking about fiscal  weve got a lot of moving parts right now and as we move through the remainder of fiscal  well provide more color around what we expect  to look like and well also be talking about broader performance targets over the coming several years next monday at the investor day and so rather than providing what would be or could be a pretty specific number id prefer to hold off on that for a while its just too early william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc and as for the addition of pharmachem clearly there is a very complimentary component of the business the overlap of the business in terms of augmenting the range of solutions that we can provide to customers taking our excipients technology and working in the nutraceuticals area they have very advanced manufacturing capability in granulation in coprocessing which is very beneficial to us and actually will allow us to do certain activities inhouse that weve had to toll  in the past and the flavors and fragrance thats really brings some new chemistries that will augment our existing portfolio where we offer for example encapsulation technology that also helps within that broader realm so i think their specific technologies that they bring and they do have very specific chemistry technology theyre bringing along with their knowhow and advanced manufacturing capabilities will be very complimentary to the businesses that we have most specifically in the personal care and pharma and nutrition jeffrey schnell  jefferies llc great thank you operator our next question comes from john roberts of ubs your line is open john roberts  ubs securities llc thank you could you talk about some of the asi raw materials you transferred bdo into asi and buy cellulose and propylene and some other derivatives there william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc yes sure sure good morning john in the quarter we did see some increase in costs related to bdo transfer from within our own company because as we described the raw material costs in that business went up that represented about a  million worth of the increase some other areas where were seeing some increases really are around cotton linters which are up a bit due to supply and demand and some activities within china and in general dynamics that are going in polypropylene so we do have some things that are going in our favor i would describe the raw material market as being a little more volatile the fact that crude oil is up by about  versus where we were at the end of the calendar year those are things that are impacting the raw materials for the business but whats most important is its our responsibility and we are taking actions to offset that raw material inflation some of which is through pricing other is through cost and of course were trying to drive a premium mix so i hope that answers your question john roberts  ubs securities llc okay yes secondly does the french deal position composites as capable of being a core specialty business longer term or it just improves its position but you still at some point need to address its role in the portfolio william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc so ill try to respond to your question but i would encourage you to if you can participate in next weeks investor meeting because we will specifically talk to the role of each parts of our portfolio and i think whats important first of all on the acquisition that were making again it was under very attractive terms and it provides some really great synergies as we try to drive that business more efficiently while serving our customers so we believe it will be very positive or have a very positive impact on our overall composites network as for the role of composites i think weve been very clear that the team there actually does a really great job of seeking out specialty portions of the marketplace like the vinyl ester resins that are used in flue gas desulfurization and other activities we also recognize that there is a volatility or if you will there arent the same margin profile that you have in a specialty chemical company at the same time the team has done a really good job of managing their costs down and so theyve been able to improve their contributions to our company and our focus really is to take that business which by the way also has strong cash generation and really focus on driving greater if you will growth from earnings were not looking to make it a more sizable business it may grow a bit but were not looking to make it more sizable per say but we do see it as a valuable part of our portfolio and down the road well assess what makes sense across our entire portfolio but for today and for the foreseeable future we see it as an important part of what we do and again i wouldnt underestimate the role that they have in terms of providing cash and cash a significant portion of that in the us here where we have some pretty strong cash needs so j kevin willis  ashland global holdings inc and the only other thing that i would add to that is that the business also covers a certain amount of somewhat fixed corporate costs that would have to be otherwise managed out if it werent in the portfolio so theres a pretty strong contribution to the overall financial health of the business with regard to that as well william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc yes and i would just add because you were referencing i wouldnt – were going to share next week a definition of what we think is a true specialty business and the composites business has some attributes of it not all attributes of what we would consider to be a true specialty chemical company business but i will say that that team is one that has really done a good job of focusing on trying to expand the role of differentiated product sales which have a higher margin profile within their business and so they go at it the right way and i dont think its – to me its not your average upr business i think weve got something that performs at a higher level operator our next question comes from david begleiter of deutsche bank your line is open william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc good morning david david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc good morning bill in asi is it taking longer than you would have expected to get pricing through to offset the high raw material costs william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc well i mean first of all the raw material inflation that we saw and are referencing really it popped up primarily after the earnings call that we had in january so it takes a bit of a time to respond we have annual contracts and other things we do expect to fully offset the impact of raw material inflation some of that will be through pricing and others will be through other cost activities one of the things that well touch on next week is there are areas where we have well say more pricing leverage within our portfolio and we can move things along more quickly pharma nutrition personal care will be those areas and certainly select segments in the industrial market and then there are some other areas where the reality is that we have to work harder and the industry as a whole has to see that inflation ultimately ending in raw materials or price increases so weve got a good split with the majority of what we do driven by those things where we have some pricing leverage but like were going to explain next week there are pockets where we are somewhat subject to whats going on within our broader industry as you can imagine were use  cellulosics and im getting into some stuff we plan to talk about next week but where we sell some of that for specialty grades and pharmaceutical materials its a lot easier than when were providing maybe some mc that goes into concrete applications so thats the scenario or the broader picture at the same time we see opportunities and especially in some of those more price sensitive areas to price to value which i will wait until next week to go into and frankly to make sure that we are running our network very efficiently so that they are not only very competitive but we can offset inflation of raw materials and make sure we continue to deliver profit growth so i think that was probably more than you were looking for were all geared up for our investor day and these are some of the themes but to the great extent we do expect to offset it most of that will be through pricing some will be through some other activities david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc very clear and just lastly in asi bill  volume growth in q it was a strong q as well is that type of volume growth sustainable in the back half of the year for asi william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc well certainly we are – we have seen the growth and one of the things well show next week is that in our core segments they have been growing weve talked about this over the years and now that we have a lot of static of other items behind us really i think youll continue to see volume growth in the aggregate for the business so yes i wont say its going to be  it could be more it could be less but we do expect to see volume growth in the second half of the year operator our next question comes from chris parkinson of credit suisse your line is open christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc thank you can you just give us a quick update on your ambitions for a new core product growth across personal care pharma and coatings i think you already had a few things in personal care specifically hair care and i guess coatings last year but just anything else youre looking at which could benefit the end of the fiscal year or into even fiscal year  thank you william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc yes you bet chris good morning and again i apologize if – and im not pushing off these questions next week youre going to hear from each one of the business leaders and in their presentations youre going to hear about some specific products which are having an impact on our sales today and will in the future i mean ultimately we need to drive and were targeting  of our sales from new and proprietary products and we believe that thats essential to allowing us to offset if you will other elements of the portfolio that just naturally mature over time and so i would say since we have specific case examples next week id rather talk to them there but the opportunity i referenced before where endurance where we were able to introduce a product which is based upon our hybrid technology something weve been talking about and really is unique unique in the terms that it penetrates the hair and actually heals from within this is different technology a different approach than other materials which tend to deal with issues on the surface of the hair and we have a number of large endcustomers who are actively working to formulate that into their end products so if i can ill defer more specific detail because that will be i think a pretty important part of our presentation next week and youll get that granularity that i think youre looking for christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc thats still fair and also just very quickly on your ma strategy can you just give any broad highlights without spoiling anything for next week regarding your new ff exposure gained from pharmachem as well as elaborate on your previous comments regarding the pharma end market i guess thats also been a focus im sure youre always searching across your entire portfolio but these two seem like they could be an area of focus so do you have any general thoughts as we progress forward thank you william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc well certainly and its important to note that as we complete the acquisition of pharmachem one of our first and foremost priorities is to onboard that business smoothly to make sure of course we sustain faith in responsible operations as they have and its important to us that we keep our customers happy and that we keep our employees engaged and we have lots of ideas for if you will commercial synergies technology synergies where the businesses can complement each other but id also emphasize that as we justified the acquisition the criteria that we used didnt include any of those potential benefits it was really based upon cost and taxbased synergies and feel very good about the associated returns because of that so in the pharma market i think what youll hear is that there really are some new pockets leveraging some of our core technologies for example weve really grown our cellulosics portion of our portfolio and the pharma sales giving new functionality in the market space we do see emerging mega trends which allow us to move forward with a variety of new very close adjacent technologies which were working on and frankly pharmachem will help us with in the personal care area biofunctionals are becoming a more and more important part of what we do and we think were very well positioned with the work thats been done over the course of the last several years so i hope i got your question there and if not please clarify and ill try to clarify for you operator our next question comes from jim sheehan of suntrust robinson humphrey your line is open james sheehan  suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning with respect to asi raw materials it looks like youve got some exposure there to propylene and butane as well as cotton linters that have moved up on you but the propylene and butane prices seem to have fallen in the last few weeks here and maybe that cost pressure is dissipating can you talk about just the overall cost pressure youre seeing and whether in the current quarter if that has eased considerably since last quarter william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc certainly and that is good news ill point out another one that we – last year the euro was at  and when we started a month ago it was down at about  or  weve seen a nice recovery which is reflected in our forecast here but from a raw material standpoint we have projected forward and we just had a detailed review what we think is a balanced view as to those prices going forward and reflected that in our outlook like you we would love to see some of these raw materials continue to go down and have that work its way through to the raw material and we hope that that will be the case but we also use a phrase here that hope is not a strategy so were going with the best information we have right now and it would be great if we could see some upside and its possible but there has been volatility i mean in january a lot of what we were talking about wasnt as prominent so weve seen some big spikes up and then weve seen some relief certainly with the butane that reduction is helping thats part of what we were referencing in terms of the bdo business that will help the bdo business as they goes forward and was part of what allowed us or made us feel more comfortable raising our outlook for that part of the business j kevin willis  ashland global holdings inc and ultimately if those lower prices sustain over time they will work through inventory as bill indicated its been the volatility of some of those raws up and down that cause us to i guess be perhaps a bit cautious in terms of the second half of the year james sheehan  suntrust robinson humphrey inc in cellulosics do you have any ability to switch from using cotton linters to wood pulp william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc we do have some flexibility and to a great degree it depends upon the specific applications that were working with in some of the very high performance areas youre really limited to a specific set of raw materials that youve qualified in the product other areas we do have more flexibility and that as were referencing thats part of making sure that even with the type of volatility that you can see in raw materials that we find effective ways to offset it so its certainly something the team is looking at and were also engaging our research team which is very capable in terms of developing new technologies but also has really great capabilities to if you will evolve our formulations and theyre spending more time and energy trying to help us improve our manufacturing processes and the related costs and look at raw material substitutions that can optimize our formula from a cost standpoint and we think thats an important component of success going forward james sheehan  suntrust robinson humphrey inc finally are you seeing any rebound in your energy business william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc we are we are that business was up pretty substantially if you will over the prior year im just taking a quick look in quarter two if you give me just one second here because i have it i believe its around  that we saw an increase in energy so right im just taking a look here more like   in energy and so thats great to see and its not the portion of our portfolio that it once was and frankly because of the cyclicality were not trying to make it front and center in our strategic focus on the other hand its really great to help on the volume side and when you see that demand increases it not only helps us because we get additional revenue but when you look at cellulosics capabilities around the globe a significant part of that goes to energy applications and so when demand picks up that means that theres greater utilization of those assets and when theres greater utilization of those assets that does affect supplydemand dynamics in some of these areas which are a little bit more price sensitive so its a good trend and i wouldnt say it materially moved the needle for us but as it continues it could have a healthy effect on our business in total j kevin willis  ashland global holdings inc and just to put it in perspective on a trailing  basis energy is about  of asi revenue james sheehan  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you operator our next question comes from mike harrison of seaport global securities your line is open william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc morning mike michael j harrison  seaport global securities llc hi good morning j kevin willis  ashland global holdings inc good morning michael j harrison  seaport global securities llc bill i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the integration process with pharmachem if you look back it predates your time with the company but when ashland acquired the isp business the integration with the hercules assets was expected to be kind of a home run and it really – i think the execution you could say didnt go very well so i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what lessons were learned during that process and how youre going to avoid some of the mistakes of the past particularly as we look at new product commercialization and that process william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc sure sure what i would say and i wasnt here so i really dont have anything perhaps kevin could comment on the isp integration but what i can tell you in this case and ive referenced our priorities going forward we think that the businesses that were acquiring are strong with strong leadership and we recognize that while theyre very complimentary that their imperatives are a bit different than the imperatives that we have for success in some of our other markets and so we will have an integration manager of course and we will be if you will setting really clear guidelines that our goal is to not make any major adjustments in the business for at least a six month period then after that once the pharmachem team knows ashland a little better and we know pharmachem a little better then well think of what steps make sense and what the appropriate timing is to get at some of the synergies that wed like to see whether they be cost or revenue based but i think we start from a position – and again this isnt in contrast to isp its just in general of respecting the team and their business and not coming in with the hubris to think that we know their business better and we can drive lots of fast synergies and we want to be very methodical about this and the business is a healthy business we are not looking to overwhelm it and make it ashlandized i mean we feel very good about what that means what ashland means i dont mean to imply anything bad but weve got to make sure we support what has made this business have a really strong track record of continued growth and success and so i cant comment so much before but hopefully you pick up from that attitude the way were going at it and i think thats the real key to success in this particular case j kevin willis  ashland global holdings inc and ill comment on the isp piece i think if i would probably have one item to put on the table i think we underclubbed the cultural aspects of the integration and the amount of time and effort perhaps that was put into that was less than it should have been part of that i think had to do with the fact that we were still moving down a transformation path and that was very much the culture of ashland at the time and one of the things that i think is very encouraging about where we sit today is weve done a lot of work over the past year year and a half around really looking at what we want the new ashland to be culturally as one organization one team all rowing pulling in the same direction with the same objectives and i think that were in a much much better position today from a cultural aspect than we were five six years ago when we pulled isp into the company so thats if i would chalk it up to one item that would be it michael j harrison  seaport global securities llc all right thanks for the color there and then just curious on the pricing approach in asi was wondering if you can give a little more detail on how thats changed i think its been a few years since you had to go out and get pricing youve had some changes in some of the competitive dynamics particularly in personal care and then obviously internally theres an increasing drive toward more specialty products can you just talk about how much traction how confident you are that youre going to be able to get the pricing that you need and is it something thats going to take a three to six monthtype timeframe or could it be a longer term timeframe william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc yes so first of all i would say that as we more or less referenced a few minutes ago that we have a range of products and value propositions in those areas which are most differentiated we think that we can reasonably pass along the price increases i think in – that fits pharma that fits personal care well or at least a great majority of it and i think it also impacts the industrial business but in the industrial business i think you do have some more price sensitive areas where we are part of the market were a leader in the market weve announced price increases and were working hard to get them i guess from my perspective our job ultimately is to get those price increases or in those areas where theres more sensitivity and we see inflation to drive the costs so that we offset anything we cant pass along or we look at and this will be part of what we discuss things that or offerings that weve done more of in the past because they were extreme premium markets we can focus on making sure that customers pay for specific services that we used to give for free and so there are a variety of techniques that we can use to sustain and grow the profitability much easier where youve got pricing leverage but i think its the whole equation as it relates to our business and so i think the pricing activities youll – we should see impact over the next three to six months and – in the cost area and how we operate the business as youll hear next week were working hard on those today and we think weve got some real action levers in those areas and its not just cutting sga its really how we operate the business operator our next question comes from dmitry silversteyn of longbow research your line is open dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc good morning guys william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc good morning dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc a couple of questions if i may first of all just looking at the growth that you guys are delivering in composites mid singledigit volume growth i think you talked about you mentioned sort of the flue exhaust as one of the areas of growth and rolling out vinyl resins can you talk about what other industries or end markets are driving the composites growth my understanding is the wind market is not being particularly strong this year and i think that was an area of growth for you so what is it your team doing in terms of broadening the approach or getting deeper into the markets thats leading to this mid singledigit growth william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc sure and i guess i would – while youre asking about end markets and those do add up and matter in this particular business weve really seen some nice growth yearoveryear in china and the rest of asia and so i think that thats an important area or region where were seeing greater strength and activity in addition we are a leader an innovator in the area of providing materials for the engineered stone the countertops we go to  pay premium for in the marketplace and we really work and develop a range of solutions to enable our manufacturers and its interesting because initially that technology that we provided helped to create the product and then now its focused on things like stain resistance getting more production through existing assets so really trying to stay ahead and continue to add value to that segment so thats one where i think we can point and say weve seen some growth weve seen some growth in transportationrelated applications and thats not just because theyre creating more vehicles but because were specked in on some really interesting applications well talk about next week and again those are areas where were more differentiated in terms of what we offer so between the regional component and some of those niche growth markets that the team has innovated in i think that covers the  weve seen and of course the revenue growth also includes impact of increasing prices so thats why theres a differential there dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc got you thats very helpful and then just a broader question i guess on the quarterly results your revenues in both segments sort of exceeded the high end of the guidance that you provided heading into the quarter but your ebitda margins were below the low end of the guidance that you provided for the quarter is it all just a function of raw material pricing timing or is there some mix or i dont know inefficiencies or yields or something creeping in why the results were what they were william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc yeah i certainly would point to raw materials and fx as being important drivers of what we do but i also just say we want to talk about the actions that we take to overcome the challenges that come before us so yes we can provide you a bridge and show you that those were things that offset the impact of volume or at least significantly but we have other levers that we need to pull and thats really what were focused on dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc okay all right fair enough and then final question in the asi segment i havent heard you guys talk about the adhesives business the  adhesives business you have that was an area of strength in the past can you just sort of touch on whats going on there now and how does it work in your outlook and for the second half of the year william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc yes certainly and when we go through the market section next week of our businesses were going to share our broader thesis and then go a little deeper into the respective markets well break out adhesives because it really is different than a lot of the other things we do within the industrial business and this is a business that has had andor we anticipate having continued sales growth so were continuing to grow it its been a good growth story which youll see and it faces its own challenges when it comes to raw material inflation theres some raw material inflation we have to make sure that thats fully digested and appreciated that dynamic with our customers but they continue to grow their sales and do it through – we break it into market growth and share gain and the markets are growing but we also see us picking up some share in those spaces as well operator our next question comes from mike sison of keybanc your line is open michael j sison  keybanc capital markets inc hi guys nice quarter there when you think about asi the guidance was i guess trimmed a little bit despite pretty good volume growth is that more a function that youll sort of get what you need in pricing and be able to pick that up in the december quarter or maybe in early parts of fiscal  william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc yes so i think in that area we obviously for the year took the bottom end of the range up but were including what we think will be some contribution from pharmachem in the fourth quarter we like you would have anticipated being more towards the middle of our range right which we put out earlier in the quarter and as we mentioned we have had some dynamics that have gone against us some of those are a little less prominent now its good to see the dollar strengthen even though for this quarter this calendar quarter last year the euro average i believe was  and so were still a bit below that and so yes i mean our actions are to drive the things weve talked about including pricing and offset those we didnt see it in this quarter were going to have some impact next quarter more than we have this quarter i think itll take a quarter or two if we look just on the pricing front to kind of work that through the whole equation but the other dynamic is it could come a little quicker if what we were talking about earlier if raw materials start to fall a little bit because of these other dynamics that takes that pricing challenge its a little bit different in terms of the degree and id emphasize sometimes when you dont move these things forward day one its because a lot of our business is done through quarterly contracts or annual contracts theyre not spot purchases which you know so we cant – i mean in the extreme i suppose we can go to customers but its hard to go in and say well we got an increase today and so tomorrow your price is going up it takes real work real work hard work and to justify it as there are always competitors out there who for whatever reason are hungry to be opportunistic because its incremental to them michael j sison  keybanc capital markets inc right william a wulfsohn  ashland global holdings inc yes i think it will build and its our job to offset it so michael j sison  keybanc capital markets inc okay great and then just a quick followup the  million to  million i think you talked about pharmachem is that a good run rate on an annualized basis for the addition j kevin willis  ashland global holdings inc weve sized that to be around  million at this point based on our diligence and things that went into us ultimately agreeing to buy the business we dont feel like theres number one cyclicality and frankly number two not much seasonality in the business either and so well give more color on that we move forward with closing it and getting to know it much much better but thats probably the way you should think about it at this point operator there are no further questions id like to turn the call back over to seth mrozek for any closing remarks seth a mrozek  ashland global holdings inc thank you very much michelle thank you very much

recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which

although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge
