   dod identifies army casualties the department of defense announced today the death of two soldiers who were supporting operation iraqi freedom  both soldiers were killed in action on october   in taza iraq when enemy forces ambushed their patrol using rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire  killed were first lieutenant david r bernstein  of phoenixville pennsylvania private first class john d hart  of bedford massachusetts             the soldiers were assigned to st battalion airborne th infantry regiment rd infantry brigade camp ederle italy             the incident is under investigation iraq death spurs push for humvee armor by ross kerber courtesy of the boston globe  march  in the days before his death private first class john d hart called his father to tell him how unsafe he felt riding around iraq in a humvee that lacked bulletproof shielding or even metal doors it would be the last conversation brian t hart would have with his yearold son on october   near kirkuk saddam hussein loyalists ambushed his sons army convoy killing two a hail of bullets felled the bedford high school graduate while he fought from his humvee when he died all his ammunition had been spent the unit commander wrote in a letter to harts parents your son gave everything he had for the safety of others    as a commander i struggle to find words that adequately capture the depth to which we honor private first class hart for brian hart a yearold bedford businessman his only sons last words have come to haunt him especially after learning that other families who lost loved ones in humvee attacks had complained to the pentagon about the lack of armor in vehicles in fact an average sport utility vehicle found on us roads provides more protection than harts humvee he would have been better off in a toyota highlander the father said turning grief into action hart cobbled together a loose network of soldiers their relatives politicians and defense contractors to pressure the military to beef up its humvees since his sons death hart has seen results since january the marine corps has ordered  million worth of bulletproof humvee door panels from fostermiller inc of waltham and last week the army said it would double its order of heavily armored humvees from its contractor more humvees in iraq still need extra protection but harts headway is remarkable for how quickly he has navigated the byzantine militaryprocurement system senator edward m kennedy democrat of massachusetts whom hart enlisted in his cause believes the fathers success can come only from a parent who feels a desperate sense of loss that he doesnt want it to happen to another parent most versions of the military transport known as the humvee short for highmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle use body panels made from thin aluminum or fiberglass that reduces weight but stops few bullets military planners thought tanks or armored personnel carriers would be used for combat patrols but there are not enough to go around in iraq where american troops drive more than  humvees according to the army last spring the army sent more than  uparmored humvees made by armor holdings incs ogarahess  eisenhardt unit in fairfield ohio these vehicles add about  pounds of bulletproof windshields and steel plating to the pound humvee made by am general llc of south bend indiana other humvees are reinforced with lighter addon steel armor kits the protection became more valuable last summer as the guerrilla warfare began patrols faced more attacks and land mines making reinforced vehicles critical how they would get more quickly was unclear since the pentagons original  budget request included  uparmored humvees an unarmored humvee costs about  while an armored one costs about twice as much of the total number of humvees in iraq just over  are fully armored according to an army tally about half of what it says it needs designers at fostermiller a closely held engineering company proposed a quick fix use armor panels made from ceramic and kevlar that could be attached to humvee doors with velcro the idea is less unusual than it sounds since the early s the company has used fabric strips made or designed by velcro usa inc of manchester nh to attach similar panels inside the cockpits of military transport planes while the army tested fostermillers product last fall the service still has not ordered any other companies that proposed similar addon armor kits complained army officials were not interested the army acknowledges it has been slow to fortify its humvees but says it is moving as fast as it can acting secretary of the army les brownlee told a senate armed services committee last week that when us troops first arrived in iraq last spring there wasnt a feeling that all humvees should be uparmored partly because the extra weight slowed them by june the army saw that its humvees needed more protection from the flood of land mines we realize that all soldiers were being exposed to these kinds of attacks and that convoys in particular were exposed brownlee said thats when we began to ramp up to provide those as soon as we could the effort was not fast enough to save john hart as a teenager the strapping hart knew he wanted to be in the army and prepared himself by joining bedford highs rifle team and junior rotc program even his teenage mischief had a military bent longtime friend ben chambers recalled sneaking out of their houses at  am to plaster army stickers around town harts mother alma sent his name to a navy recruiter thinking that service might be safer but chambers said hart was determined to wind up as an army soldier on the ground actually doing something as opposed to sitting behind a desk he wanted to be the person making a difference after enlisting in september  hart joined his unit the d airborne brigade in northern iraq last summer a trained paratrooper he was in several firefights and earned a combat infantryman badge others in his unit have since told his father how they also felt vulnerable on patrol in humvees one was specialist joshua sams the driver of harts humvee who was injured during the ambush in a telephone interview sams said he was not sure whether armor would have saved hart because he was riding in the open bed of the humvee when the squad came under fire sams said armor would have protected another soldier lieutenant david r bernstein  who died in the attack a graduate of the us military academy at west point ny bernstein bled to death after being hit by a bullet that tore through the humvee sams said you could see the hole in the vehicle sams said on oct  brian and alma hart woke to a  am knock at the door at the familys bedford home a policeman a local priest and an army officer delivered the news at the time the family was scheduled to move to illinois where brian hart was to start a new job as an executive at a drug wholesaler the family remained in massachusetts fearing a move would be too stressful and hart began a local job search he has devoted much of his time to researching armored vehicles working the internet and phones daily hart learned about more soldiers killed in unarmored humvees and which defense contractors made addon armor for the vehicles he also became an outspoken critic appearing on national radio shows granting newspaper interviews and making trips to meet with politicians in washington dc after his son was buried at arlington national cemetery hart took up the issue with kennedy who attended the service kennedy said he had heard concerns about humvees but embraced the issue after meeting with the harts of the  soldiers killed in iraq who were either massachusetts residents or who have next of kin in the state six died in unarmored humvees or trucks according to a count by kennedys office as of midjanuary hart touched base with others in washington including democratic representatives john murtha of pennsylvania and brian baird of washington other politicians got involved after hearing concerns from their constituents they in turn began to contact army officials about the humvee armor and why more units did not have it at a senate hearing in november brownlee the acting secretary of the army said the service had ordered as many uparmored vehicles as its contractors could produce but that it would take until mid to deliver them that seemed like a long time to hart he went to the web and learned that the armor makers were not at full production later a representative from ogarahess confirmed that hart took those details to kennedys office armed with that information the senator urged the army to speed its approval and acquisition process under pressure the army tested bulletproof door panels from fostermiller the waltham defense contractor making them ready for the marine corps to buy in january the political questions raised the profile of the issue said doug thomson business development manager at fostermiller a major breakthrough came last week when brownlee unveiled plans to double orders of heavily armored humvees from  to  a month while a good start brian hart said he hardly calls it a victory he still plans to spend much of his time working the phones to make sure the plans get fully funded its an obligation hart said pretty much an obligation from a father to his son to try to protect his friends bedford massachusetts brian hart is on a quest for answers by night he sends email messages and posts notes on electronic bulletin boards by day he works the phones mr hart is haunted by the ambush that killed his son private first class john hart a yearold paratrooper with the rd infantry brigade was hit in the neck and killed on october   in taza near kirkuk it was the same latenight attack that took the life of lieutenant bernstein their unit was ordered to find the enemy the enemy found them but what happened after that after the grenades ripped into the humvee did john bleed to death did he suffer asked alma hart his mother mr hart is more critical the army hasnt given us any more information than a threesentence press release he said its awful an army spokeswoman shari lawrence said what relatives are told about a soldiers death was sometimes incomplete because we try to notify the family as quickly as possible so the harts have turned to their sons comrades for information they have learned that some soldiers have been camping out in water treatment facilities and sleeping on pipes and that others lack the right protective gear and that most humvees like the one their son was riding in are not armored it breaks your heart that these kids are living in real deprivation out there and we dont know about it mrs hart said major gary tallman an army spokesman said that nearly  troops in iraq more than a third of the total force there did not have bulletproof vests but that the army hoped to have them outfitted by next year the harts are working with members of congress to get more resources now they still support the war they just want it fought better two dedicated soldiers honored families mourn victims of war  courtesy of the washington post  wednesday november   when army captain john r teal was in high school in hanover county virginia he told his mother that he didnt like how the school would just throw the flag up the pole in the morning and pull it down at night so he persuaded school officials to institute a military flag ceremony which he helped conduct daily until his graduation in  a decade later and more than  miles away john d hart joined junior rotc at his high school in bedford massachusetts after he watched the events of september   on television hart decided to dedicate himself to what had been an occasional dream  becoming a soldier he enlisted in the army shortly after graduation last year and wound up a private with the rd airborne brigade yesterday teal and hart became the nd and rd us casualties from iraq to be buried at arlington national cemetery this year before teals ceremony a bittersweet irony was on the mind of his mother who recalled that it was a former guard at arlington who had taught her son how to care for the flag in high school so its going to take everything ive got to keep it together when they hand me that flag said emmie teal its going to be rough john teal  was killed october   when a homemade bomb exploded on a roadside where he was traveling with a convoy about  miles northeast of baghdad according to the army family and friends remembered him yesterday as someone who made fast friends with almost everyone he met they recalled him playing soldier as a boy of about  dressed in fatigues and patrolling the ditches around the familys central virginia home emmie teal said that when her son was deployed to iraq she had a dark feeling that something bad could happen that tension stayed with her every day she said until the uniformed officers showed up at the door to break the news to her and her husband joseph part of me didnt believe it when they told me she said i had to see him just to make sure there wasnt some mistake i knew they werent wrong but i had to see for myself after teals body was shipped home to a funeral parlor just outside richmond the bad news sunk in with finality by the time emmie teal greeted the other tearyeyed mourners at the graveside service yesterday she had been allowed a few private moments for one last look at her son  but what we saw there that wasnt the boy we knew she said the smile was gone he was never without a smile a few hundred yards from where a composed emmie teal was handed the folded american flag that had rested on her sons coffin harts graveside ceremony was soon to begin hart was killed five days before teal when his humvee was ambushed near kirkuk in northern iraq a memorial service for hart last week drew hundreds to the bedford town common for a candlelight vigil at that service and at yesterdays burial friends remembered the yearold soldier as playful determined and kind they described a young man who loved animals and  before settling on a career in the military  talked of being a veterinarian he placed others wellbeing above his own said the rev john gibbons of the bedford unitarian community who delivered a graveside eulogy he was proud to serve in freedoms cause the soldiers parents brian and alma were joined yesterday by harts two teenage sisters and a large contingent of family and friends who traveled to washington from massachusetts ed hynes a family friend said that the conditions described by hart in letters home have led the family to make appeals to the military to provide more resources to protect service members in iraq the message they want to get out from all this is to make sure the soldiers are properly equipped over there  theyre not  percent sure thats the case hynes said and they also want to make sure the american people welcome home each and every soldier with open arms whether they agree with this war or not soldier from bedford remembered at memorial service  october  bedford massachusetts  tears and laughter marked the memorial service for army private john hart as family and friends remembered a kind and eversmiling young man who loved animals and dreamed of serving his country you dreamed of being a soldier and you lived your dream an emotional brian hart told his son at the interfaith memorial service at st michaels church in harts hometown hart who enlisted right after high school was killed last weekend when his patrol came under fire in iraq exactly a month after he turned  i presumed youd come back and become a teacher or a counselor you already were a counselor to many brian hart said hart recalled how the september  terrorist attacks changed his family and strengthened his sons resolve to serve his country your sense of duty and convictions were strong hart said as they say justice does not exist unless you make it you had the courage to live those words he and others remembered the young man who loved animals so much that he once brought a wounded skunk home and had to get rabies shots another time the adventurous hart and his buddies got so lost on a camping trip it took them nine hours to get to mount monadnock in new hampshire usually about an hours drive from bedford they managed to miss the entire state of new hampshire said major dennis saucier a chaplain in the air force who was also a neighbor of the harts and whose son was also on that trip laughter rippled through the church that trip also brought out harts compassionate side hart found a woman stuck on the mountain with a broken leg and he and his friends ran up and down the trail to get help and care for her saucier said after the service bagpipers played in the light drizzle and a veterans color guard marched to a plaza behind the church where junior rotc members from bedford high school folded a flag and presented it to harts parents more than  people including governor mitt romney and his wife ann attended the ceremony hart whose body was still in germany will be buried in the arlington national cemetery in virginia on november   lauren badia  who is a close friend of harts sister rebecca said hart was just like a big teddy bear he was so caring and compassionate said badia who has known the harts since kindergarten he really was the life of every party when hed tell stories hed make all these great sound effects he was

soon after john was deployed brian hart publicly declared his disdain for the speak out for peace sign that was put up on the first parish church by parishioners he claimed the sign disrespected those who are fighting for our country by suggesting that peace is the answer to the problem he saw the sign on his way to pick up his son from the airport in march the last time he came home the rev john gibbons said the church did not mean disrespect for those serving they simply wanted to uphold the idea of peace the church agreed however to take the sign down after two weeks now the harts are

brigade his father believes his sons patrol helped prevent a civil war in iraq harts parents said the army also increased harts confidence that it was good for him i cried when he left harts mother said he called me the next morning and said im sorry i made you cry maj dennis saucier is the base chaplain at hanscom air force base and harts father said he was a friend of his son through saucier brian hart was able to learn that johns body is in germany right now hart is eligible to be buried in arlington national cemetery and that is where his family decided he should rest preparations for the funeral will be made in the next few weeks last weekend the harts sold their house and will move to the chicago area the harts want to donate a bench or other memorial to their son and place it near the high school hart was one of the students in the jr rotc who took part in the honor guard at the unveiling of memorial park in bedford brian harts opinion of the war has not changed since his sons death it is cruel fate that someone so good and so loved would perish and truly evil people continue to perpetuate fear and destruction he said there may be a smarter plan than this but i dont know what it is there may be a local memorial service for hart this weekend but there are no details yet his friends are planning a candlelight vigil in bedford this week sitting next to her husband brian hart alma hart cries during the funeral for their son  army private first class john d hart at arlington cemetery tuesday nov    hart who was from bedford massachusetts was killed in action on oct   in taza iraq   when enemy forces ambushed his patrol using rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire  harts sisters rebecca  second from right and elizabeth  right also attended the funeral brian hart right watches as his wife alma lays her hand on the casket of their son army  private first class john d hart during his funeral ceremony at arlington cemetery tuesday  november   november  alma hart stood over her only sons grave at arlington national cemetery in november  vowing to honor his life pfc john hart was just  when he was shot dead by an iraqi enemy  just three months after his arrival in iraq when we buried john i promised him i would think of him every day said hart yesterday her voice breaking and i have today as another veterans day passes alma hart  her husband brian  and their two teenage daughters will lay a wreath in johns memory at memorial park near their bedford home john hart was one of  massachusetts soldiers killed in the war so far but helping the living is what helps his mother make sense of her childs death she has begun volunteering at bedfords veterans administration hospital determined to make sure the soldiers there arent ignored like many who returned from vietnam i will not let this happen to the iraq generation we cant just stuff them in a hospital and leave them there hart said this is how i will honor my son i just cant sit around and stare at johns picture there are guys that still need me john hart was killed as he traveled with fellow soldiers in a canvascovered humvee in northern iraq in a phone call home a week before his death he told his father he lacked body armor and ammunition he said dad can you do something  hart remembered alma hart said she and her husband were stunned though they had heard news reports of illequipped soldiers we were hoping it wasnt true president bush had announced the war was over in may and i thought they were just there on peacekeeping stuff hart said by the time the couple decided to write a letter to massachusetts congressmen the army was ringing the doorbell to say john was killed hart said they sent him into an ambush where there wasnt a snowballs chance in hell he was going to survive she said she vividly remembers the early morning in october  when her doorbell rang looking out the window she saw a local police officer a priest and an army official i thought i just wont open the door they cant tell me if i dont open the door  hart said hart feels deceived the white house hasnt established that iraq had weapons of mass destruction or a connection to alqaeda i bought the whole line the president told me something and i believed him hart said but brian and i have this nagging fear that it is going to come to nothing we want something meaningful to come out of this for john this is the big tragedy for us and to think he was lied to by his government and sent over there illequipped and unprepared is very upsetting i used to be a republican until they killed my son hart said killing my boy was the last straw she wants american troops brought home it isnt just johns death it isnt only about our son it is about everybodys sons it is about all the innocent iraqis who are trying to raise a family just like me we cant fight their civil war for them fatal inaction by april witt sunday june   page w courtesy of the washington post magazine the worlds most powerful military failed to provide the armor that would have saved scores of american lives one father wouldlike to know why private first class john hart whispered into the phone so he wouldnt be overheard it was just a matter of time he said before his buddies and he bumped down some back road in iraq right into an ambush they were so exposed the somber young soldier told his dad back home in bedford massachusetts they were riding around in unarmored humvees with canvas tops and gaping openings on the sides where doors should be that seemed pretty stupid now that people were shooting at them and lobbing rockets john a yearold gunner whose job it was to keep his head up and return fire felt hung out in the breeze as johns father brian hart remembers the conversation he listened with growing alarm then stepped into his home office so his wife alma wouldnt hear it was october   the harts couldnt have been prouder of their only son for answering the presidents call to fight the war against terror in iraq that very day the harts had accepted a contract to sell their clapboard house in historic bedford in part because they felt out of step with antiwar sentiments in town seven months earlier on the eve of war the congregation of first parish unitarian church had unfurled a big blue banner emblazoned speak out for peace the harts were offended the banner loomed over the town common hallowed ground where bedford minutemen had gathered before the first battles of the revolutionary war in nearby lexington and concord the normally softspoken brian hart told town selectmen that if the banner didnt come down hed sue the town the day the war began the unitarians rolled up their peace banner voluntarily still the skirmish left the harts feeling so out of sorts with bedford their home of  years that they planned to move away now talking on the phone with his young warrior brian tried to understand what he was hearing dont believe spinmeisters on tv brian recalls his son saying the iraqi insurgency is real and building john and his buddies in charlie company of the th infantry regiment of the rd airborne brigade were patrolling ever longer distances in thinskinned humvees suited for hauling cargo not for carrying soldiers under fire this was not the first time john had confided that the us military was failing to provide him with essential equipment in previous calls home brian recalls john recounted a bewildering array of shortages and snafus before landing in iraq that scorching july john told his father hed been issued a winterweight camouflage suit body armor with protective plates too small to shield his broad chest and a broken rifle an expert marksman and former cocaptain of the bedford high school shooting team john had been told to conserve scarce bullets by not taking practice shots to sight his weapon he said summertime water rations were so inadequate that guys were passing out in the iraqi heat john endured these hardships gamely he had wanted to be a soldier as long as anyone could remember in high school he joined the jrotc and daydreamed of military life filling his notebooks with sketches of tanks now he was living his dream during this call home however john seemed unusually concerned he asked his dad to do something to get his buddies the equipment they needed to try to survive he said anything i could do would be greatly appreciated brian recalled brian hung up haunted by the grim fatalism in his sons voice this is how its going to be john had told him were going to be riding down some road when were ambushed from the side    one week later fatalism would prove to be prophecy pfc chris williams  remembers thinking why us williams and john hart were sitting in the back of an m cargo humvee it was late nearly  pm on october   they were hot and tired after an exhausting day escorting their commanding officer capt john kilbride between safe houses where elements of his command were encamped their vehicle and two other humvees were to ride together to kirkuk air base hot chow hot showers phone banks and internet access we were happy the day was going to end williams recalls then the plan changed insurgents had just fired rockets at kirkuk the air force had coordinates for the enemy firing position and this convoy had been ordered to hunt for the rocketlobbers im like uh why are they sending us williams recalls we were returning kitchen equipment we were not combateffective    you are going to investigate a rocket attack so you know they have rockets why send guys in a rickety humvee to chase guys who have rockets williams didnt ask his questions aloud i was a private recalls williams now a clerk at a blockbuster video in washington state i wasnt supposed to ask questions the convoy rolled away from the safe house into the dark there were  men among the three vehicles kilbride one of at least four members of his extended family to graduate from west point rode in the lead humvee his second in command st lt david bernstein  was in the last humvee with williams and hart specialist joshua sams  was at the wheel bernstein was valedictorian of his suburban philadelphia high school he graduated fifth in his class at west point he was so fit and gungho about physical training that his men affectionately called him super dave behind his back everyone liked super dave he was known for listening to the concerns of his men and trying to help i respected him not because he was an officer but because of who he was as a person sams says it was pitchblack as the convoy followed a back road through open agricultural fields sitting on makeshift benches in the open back bed of the humvee the two privates were not just exposed  their only protection some kevlar blankets draped over the benches  they couldnt see much roughly  yards to the right a large earthen berm paralleled the road up ahead the road took a degree turn to the left and the berm turned with it it was about  pm when six to eight insurgents dug in along the berm opened fire on the convoy with rocketpropelled grenades medium machine guns and ak assault rifles according to combatant interviews and available military documents kilbrides humvee sped through the left turn in the road and kept going it was standard procedure for ambushed convoys to speed through the kill zone then regroup down the road for possible counterattack as the second humvee accelerated a chaplain whod been hitching a ride back to base when the convoy mission changed took cover lying flat on the floor a soldier used the clergymans back as a firing platform to steady his light machine gun the third humvee was taking the brunt of the enemy attack sams killed the headlights and hit the gas he crouched low and leaned as far as he could out the open left side of the humvee  away from the enemy fire  while still driving more than  miles an hour sams saw bernstein next to him firing at the insurgents with his m rifle he says behind him he heard hart open fire too in the back bed of the humvee next to hart williams says he believed his rifle had jammed so he went for cover trying to shield himself behind the kevlar blankets i was waiting to die he says he heard harts machine gun fall silent then felt him drop to the floor of the humvee beside him he yelled at hart to keep firing hart didnt answer or move thats when i knew he was dead williams says at the wheel sams recalls he maneuvered to avoid being blown up by a rocketpropelled grenade that missed the humvee by a yard and a half instead of following the left turn in the road sams drove straight onto a field as the humvee hurtled forward sams fell out the left side opening where a door should have been as he tumbled his armored vest snagged on the front left wheel well he was dragged still conscious  yards until the driverless humvee struck the berm then rolled backward pinning samss left arm beneath the wheel silence deep silence nobody was firing sams recalls not his guys not the other guys the rest of the convoy was long gone sams wondered if anyone else was alive in his humvee he wondered if he was alone out there sams tried to pull his arm free it wouldnt budge he swung his legs around placed both feet in the wheel well and pushed trying to lift the  ton vehicle off his arm no go sams rolled on to his side and stretched out his legs testing to see if he could reach one foot inside the humvee and hit the gas stuff you basically know you cant do sams recalls i was trying to save my arm desperate sams called out in the dark that his arm was pinned and he needed someone to drive the humvee off him a lone figure appeared around the back of the humvee it was too dark for sams to make out who it was maybe an insurgent in which case he was dead sams watched the large silent figure lurch around the truck struggle to climb in the drivers side opening fail and fall down again the figure tried to climb into the humvee and again he fell four times he tried and fell sams recalls on the fifth attempt the figure climbed into the drivers seat and reversed the humvee off samss arm then the man collapsed and tumbled out of the humvee onto the dirt field sams tried to stand to go to his rescuer but fell forward thats when he realized he had broken his ankle he fell close enough to his rescuer to recognize him at last it was bernstein super dave i asked him where he was hit sams recalls he said my leg sams who had taken a  day course in basic combat first aid patted bernsteins left leg until he felt dampness i found his entrance and exit wound sams says my fingers went in as i was patting him up the insurgents machinegun fire had easily pierced the thin skin of their unarmored vehicle and struck bernstein above the left knee sams like most soldiers kept field dressings gauze pads with strings attached tucked in the webbing of his armored vest he tied the dressing around bernsteins leg thats when it dawned on me i have two privates in the back of the vehicle i havent heard a word from sams recalls steadying himself against the humvee sams hopped back to the rear of the vehicle there he found hart dead with a bullet hole in his neck and williams sitting unharmed head down arms wrapped around his legs sams thought williams might be in shock williams said he wasnt sams told williams to pick up harts machine gun reload and stand guard williams searched harts body for more ammo in the dark williams couldnt figure out how to remove harts ammo case so he tore the bullets out in strips hurrying in case they were attacked again sams went back to kneel beside his lieutenant my pants legs were instantly covered drenched in blood sams says the bullet had severed bernsteins femoral artery the lieutenant was going to bleed to death if they didnt tie a tourniquet around his leg fast but they hadnt been issued tourniquets eight months earlier a committee of military medical experts had urged the pentagon to give every soldier in the war a tourniquet bleeding to death from an arm or leg wound is the most common cause of preventable death in combat the committee on tactical combat casualty care reported quick access to a cheap simple modern tourniquet could save many lives military doctors had concluded yet it would be two more years before the us central command which runs combat operations in iraq adopted a policy saying all soldiers in combat should carry a tourniquet even then the policy was moot because the army didnt widely distribute tourniquets for several more months an investigation by the baltimore sun spurred that distribution and documented one reason for the delay military procurement specialists were studying what kind of pouch to carry the new first aid kits with tourniquets in that left sams in october  in much the same position as a soldier on a revolutionary war battlefield trying to improvise a tourniquet with a length of cloth and a stick only sams couldnt find a stick in the iraqi field i was looking for anything hard sams recalls he and williams found a fuelcan nozzle in the humvee sams wrapped a fresh field dressing around bernsteins leg and used the gas nozzle to try to twist the dressing tightly enough to staunch the arterial bleed as sams twisted the strings on the field dressing broke desperate sams cut the strap off an m rifle and tried again the strap didnt break but it was too short it kept coming untwisted sams says so he tied a dressing on top of his improvised tourniquet to keep it in place bernstein still had a pulse but hed stopped moaning sams says sams didnt have time to feel relieved when he finally spied his platoon leader and a few other soldiers  a scouting party from the convoy  walking toward their crash site he checked the lieutenants neck and could no longer find a pulse he says he tried to perform cpr but with his wounded arm couldnt apply much pressure he let one of the newly arrived soldiers take over sams leaned against the humvee exhausted and watched a sad succession of privates and officers pound bernsteins chest long past knowing their efforts were futile roughly an hour after the attack on the convoy a blackhawk helicopter arrived to evacuate bernstein and sams according to interviews and records sams now a longhaul truck driver never regained the feeling in his left arm bernstein one of west points finest a genuine hero educated for military brilliance at a cost of more than  to taxpayers died without a  tourniquet john hart  who loved the celebratory soldiers anthem when johnny comes marching home  never would the next morning in a tan clapboard house in bedford brian hart knew even before he saw the army officer policeman and catholic priest standing stonefaced on his front stoop he could hear alma screaming noooooooooo it wasnt long before the harts house was jammed with mourners camera crews camped out front brian and alma knew scant details about how john and bernstein had died they knew their son and the lieutenant had the sad distinction of being the rd and th soldiers to die in iraq after president george w bush declared an end to major combat brian and alma didnt draw the drapes on their grief they held impromptu news conferences on the lawn they still believed in the war alma then  told the boston globe you know its just a dirty job thats got to be done john understood the risk when he enlisted and went to iraq eyes open brian then  told the associated press the unitarian church pastor the rev john gibbons arrived to offer condolences to the family that had opposed his congregations peace banner he found them he remembers looking dazed at the center of a chaotic throng earlier that morning gibbons had taken the pulpit to say that issues of war were no longer abstract for bedford the town of just over  had suffered its first battlefield casualty since world war ii bedford mourned johns loss along with his parents and two younger sisters the first snow of the season had blanketed the town commons where hundreds of residents gathered for a candlelight vigil in johns memory a former classmate of johns made a huge magenta wreath festooned it with a photograph of john in his uniform and laid it against a granite boulder on the commons a few days later at a more formal memorial service gibbons read a poem by archibald macleish the young dead soldiers do not speak nevertheless they are heard in the still houses    they say our deaths are not ours they are yours they will mean what you make them johns body was en route from iraq to be buried at arlington national cemetery brian and alma spent all week unsure exactly where their dead son was brian felt lost too it was almost impossible to believe that a young man so tenderhearted that he once tried to save a sick skunk  and ended up getting  weeks of rabies shots for his troubles  died so violently one week after johns death brian walked alone to the town commons it was nearly midnight the only motion in the square was a stoplight flashing yellow brian sat on a bench next to johns photo smiling at him from the magenta wreath  so sweet and handsome  and sobbed on october   the harts went to west point for bernsteins funeral after the service brian says he asked the sergeant who had escorted bernsteins body back from iraq if it was true that the lieutenant and his son had been riding in an unarmored humvee the sergeant said yes and that he thought there were only five fully factoryarmored m humvees in all of northeastern iraq what else brian wanted to know did our soldiers in iraq need but not have the sergeant introduced brian to an army officer and they talked for an hour i learned that these boys didnt even have the right bandages brian recalls it is on the battlefield that some men find their moment of truth they shoot or duck kill or hesitate save or sacrifice themselves brian hart who never donned a uniform or raised a gun at any enemy experienced his moment of truth in a graveyard for soldiers once brian started asking questions he couldnt stop he flew to washington two days before johns funeral at arlington to question the soldier escorting his sons body home  chris williams whod been riding next to john during the fatal ambush williams told him that the bullet that killed bernstein went right through the thin metal skin of the unarmored humvee and that the vehicle had not even a simple gun shield for john to take cover behind when he returned fire senator edward kennedy dmass was planning to attend johns november  funeral brian contacted his office and asked if he and kennedy could meet before the service to talk some of brians relatives were aghast brian grew up in a family of fundamentalist christians who vote republican at the university of texas brian was president of the campus republicans now some of his texas relatives warned brian not to be seen with kennedy he recalls brian didnt care to get answers he needed allies he even called john kerrys presidential campaign but nobody called back he says kerry did send an aide to johns funeral standing in an administrative office at arlington john harts grieving parents and kennedy talked so long that they delayed the funeral  minutes kennedy promised that he would try to get the senate armed services committee to hold a hearing on equipment shortages during the service taps sounded in the distance seven or eight times for other soldiers being laid to rest the harts flew home where brian a business executive began spending hours at his computer and on the phone searching for an explanation of how the worlds greatest military could have let his son and bernstein die the way they did i needed to know he says i just needed to know what was going on john asked me to do something then he was dead we have what we have army chief of staff peter schoomaker said as he sat at the witness table in a meeting room of the hart senate office building we have as much body armor as we have because thats what we invested in we have the amount of humvees because thats what we invested in on november   the senate armed services committee held a hearing at which senators questioned schoomaker and acting secretary of the army les brownlee about shortages in body armor and armored humvees brownlee acknowledged that in some places in iraq the us military could provide only one interceptor vest with protective plates for every three us soldiers the military was so short of fully factoryarmored humvees that it would take two years for the manufacturer to produce enough to meet current needs he said to try to protect troops sooner than that the military was testing and examining ways to add armor to existing thinskinned humvees kennedy retorted that waiting until  for an adequate supply of factoryarmored humvees was unacceptable he invoked brian and alma hart to explain why when i was out at arlington for private first class harts burial the parents said if you can do anything to make sure that other soldiers who are over there are not put in the kind of danger that my son was put in and lost that would be the best thing that we could ever think of in terms of our son kennedy pressed brownlee on whether the military could speed production of new fully factoryarmored humvees ive been assured were buying everything they can produce brownlee said i mean are they running their plant  hours a day kennedy asked my understanding is sir theyre operating at maximum capacity   that night some television news reports on the hearing mentioned johns death the harts had become the poster family for preventable deaths in unarmored humvees brian was a natural spokesman for the cause he had the soft voice and gentle optimistic demeanor of a jimmy stewart character he had boundless faith that now that the equipment problems had been acknowledged the nation would solve them he even started to feel a little bit like mr smith goes to washington i thought it was all a mistake that would be corrected once people found out he says soldiers have been dying over equipment failures for as long as nations have made war as the traditional nursery rhyme meant to teach children the consequences of failing to prepare goes for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost for want of a horse the rider was lost for want of a rider the battle was lost for want of a battle the kingdom was lost and all for the want of a horseshoe nail some equipment shortages in the iraq war were both as tragic and as easy as the rhyme to understand the pentagon prepared to fight the wrong war a short war over weapons of mass destruction that would end with iraqis celebrating their liberation one month before the war for example the army had on hand at least two chemicalbio protective suits for every soldier it would send into iraq the government accountability office later documented they sat unneeded the wmd never materialized while the insurgency flourished without the benefit of any chemical or biological weapons meanwhile nearly  us troops in iraq more than onethird of the total force there still lacked modern body armor eight months after the war began an army spokesman said at the time the us military had expected that only forward combat elements would need body armor not the rear troops the logistics forces brownlee explained to the senate armed services committee on november  they hadnt expected an insurgency that placed all the troops at risk of coming into close contact with the enemy there is no rear area senator john warner rva the committee chairman said some equipment problems and shortages that plagued the troops in iraq were more baffling brian hart discovered as he began networking with politicians soldiers private contractors and relatives of soldiers eager to get troops whatever they needed to survive in december brian corresponded with people in missouri volunteering time and money to privately armor vehicles for a company of army reservists about to go to iraq the town mortician paid the bill brian recalls a local steel company shut down for a week a crew armored the vehicles with highgrade commercial steel brian delighted in the cando spirit of his fellow americans  but only briefly the army threatened not to let the reservists use their freshly cut  pounds of donated armor because the steel hadnt been tested for conformity to military specifications the reservists left for iraq with armor for their vehicles only after irate missouri congressmen intervened at the last minute brian was dumbfounded on the eve of war  eight months before private first class john hart and first lieutenant david bernstein took their final ride in an illequipped convoy  some of the nations most powerful members of congress asked top military and defense officials to testify about bushs defense budget the hearing room was packed on february   as general richard myers the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld faced their legislative overseer the senate armed services committee an invasion of iraq seemed imminent tensions with north korea were mounting senator warner asked myers the obvious question was the military prepared so i start with you general warner said the armed forces which are under your supervision is it your professional judgment that they are prepared to meet any contingency for the use of force as may be required in iraq    and to continue the high level of activity against the worldwide terrorism myers responded ill give you a real short answer absolutely neither warner nor the other senators present asked followup questions about preparedness the senators didnt ask about what the nations fighting men and women might need that they didnt have the general didnt tell they would have had plenty to talk about general eric k shinseki then army chief of staff wrote to congress a few weeks later saying that the administration budget left the army alone  billion short of what the service needed for sustainment of warfighting readiness shinsekis wish list of unfunded requests included items as basic as guns bullets and armor once the nation went to war soldiers and marines on the ground soon found themselves short of even water and food according to the gao the military lacked more than  million cases of meals ready to eat soldiers ran short of the nonrechargeable lithium batteries needed to operate  different communication and electronic systems systems that are critical to tracking targets or allowing soldiers under fire talk to one another many soldiers and marines not only didnt have armor on trucks or humvees they didnt even have spare tires the tire shortage was so severe that some soldiers and marines were forced to strip and abandon expensive and otherwise perfectly good vehicles because they had no way to replace flats the gao later documented soldiers lacking body armor and riding in unarmored vehicles with no spare tires were not unfortunate flukes they were evidence of what the gao in a  report called systemic problems with how the military prepares for war among them failing to maintain adequate reserves of crucial items inaccurately forecasting supply inadequate funding and delayed purchasing all of us had certain imperfections whether its the military branch or the congress warner says now both military decisionmakers and their congressional overseers drew on their experiences of the gulf war which was over in  hours he says this problem was entirely foreseeable says winslow wheeler who published a  book on the subject titled wastrals of defense wheeler spent  years as a congressional staff member before joining a privately funded research institute the center for defense information as head of its military reform project it is the inevitable consequence of what weve been doing for the last  years    pedestrian items are not sexy inside the pentagon and certainly not on capitol hill they only become sexy when you go to war and they are missing since the mids wouldbe reformers have lamented that the military in its efforts to modernize tends to make its equipment and weapons systems more complicated which makes them more expensive  but not necessarily more effective in  a pentagon analyst named franklin c spinney made the cover of time magazine for his efforts deeply unpopular inside the pentagon to debunk the assumptions driving that trend when new weapons systems were being developed spinney observed pentagon planners tended to promise they would be cheaper better and easier to maintain than the old system rosy predictions helped get the new system approved spinney argued so did what he called political engineering in which the contractor chosen to build the system would seek subcontractors in as many congressional districts as possible inevitably spinney found as the program evolved the pentagon would be forced to acknowledge continual cost increases while curtailing performance requirements astronomically expensive ventures such as the  billion fa raptor program  in which the cost of each fighter jet has soared to more than  million  leave relative scraps for more mundane pentagon programs that provide soldiers with boots bullets and beans spinney said the problem has only gotten worse since i first started talking about it spinney says now as costs for new systems strain the budget defense department managers look for accounts to raid they raid two places particularly the operating budget and the personnel budget says wheeler who worked on defense budgeting during his decades on the hill the operating budget buys spare parts clothing ammunition gas food all that unsexy pedestrian stuff congress rather than force the pentagon to reorder its priorities and buy servicemen and women what theyll need most should they have to go to war gets these budget requests and makes the problem worse wheeler says congress adds pork members of congress salt defense budgets with pet projects like a jogging track snake eradication programs or a parade ground maintenance contract for a longclosed military base  all actual examples from recent budgets wheeler says congress has been doing this for decades he says the aspect that is new is that the amount of pork has been accelerating since  theres cover for defense spending in that were now at war nobody has paid much attention once the iraq war began members of congress were flooded with calls and letters from constituents who were angry and scared that their loved ones were underequipped when soldiers have internet access and get to phone home you cant hide the truth for long brian hart says congress demanded that the military correct the problem and authorized the pentagon to spend  billion more for body and vehicular armor than the president requested warner says but it was too late for many soldiers the us military bureaucracy is like a giant overloaded ship that turns excruciatingly slowly  even under fire in may  the first us soldier in iraq was killed by an improvised explosive device ied it was about a week later before the second one showed up and about another week before the third one maj gen buford c blount who led us troops into iraq from kuwait at the start of the war later told congress by midjune it was clear a pattern started to develop for ied usage blount testified yet it wasnt until november   nearly five months later  that the army said it needed  armor kits to retrofit five types of trucks to protect the troops from ieds the army did not produce all the kits until february  and did not install them fully until may    months after it formally identified the need the gao found by that time however the number of unarmored trucks in iraq that needed retrofitting kits had skyrocketed outstripping the supply rep duncan hunter rcalif chairman of the house armed services committee expressed outrage when he visited iraq in  and found stilldesperate troops hanging plywood around openbedded vehicles back in washington he called three generals and an undersecretary of defense before the committee to excoriate them weve got an acquisition system that absolutely has a case of the slows hunter said you guys cant tie your shoelaces thank god for the inventiveness of the american soldier michael wynne then acting undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics responded id like to also say sir that there are some things that you are i think highlighting today that we could do better jim magee a retired marine colonel who experienced the military acquisition system as both a soldier and a contractor agrees he says that while serving in beirut in  he was disgusted to see french soldiers wearing expensive stateoftheart body armor while his men were wearing junk that wouldnt stop a rumor magee vowed to change that in the mids he became president of point blank body armor where he helped develop the interceptor body armor system now issued to every us soldier in iraq the interceptor consists of an outer vest designed primarily to stop shrapnel front and back ceramic inserts to stop small arms fire and attachments to protect areas such as the throat and groin working on the project magee says he was frustrated by what he viewed as the low priority the military seemed to place on getting troops the best body armor possible as military officials reviewed prototypes of the interceptor they asked point blank to reduce the areas of the body to be covered by the outer vest change the configuration of the ceramic plates and limit the available sizes of those plates magee says the reason was money magee says an army spokesman lt col william wiggins says he was unable to locate any military procurement official who recalled suggesting that they wanted less coverage or smaller plates based on budget objectives once point blank and the military agreed on what body armor to produce magee expected that the military might contract with several companies to make it ensuring that all us troops received them as soon as possible he says instead point blank won an exclusive contract to make the outer vests through very effective lobbying magee says magee who left point blank in  was a salaried employee and the exclusive contract with the military didnt increase his paycheck he says but it was a good deal for david brooks the chief executive and largest shareholder of point blanks parent company dhb industries inc his compensation went from  in  to more than  million in  it was a considerably less good deal for soldiers and marines magee says roughly  companies in the country were qualified to make the interceptors outer vest magee says its not rocket science its sewing by initially hiring just point blank and spreading body armor purchases from the company out over several years the military created a bottleneck that kept many soldiers and marines wearing outdated vests unnecessarily for years magee says at the start of the iraq war point blank was producing just  interceptor vests a month army spokesman wiggins says once the iraq war began and the body armor shortage became obvious the pentagon hired additional contractors to make the vests and protective plate inserts which sped up production to a peak of  outer vests a month still the gao documented that not all troops in iraq had interceptor vests and plates until january   eight months after combat operations were declared over wiggins called the armys production rampup a tremendous success story    the requirements kept changing we needed more and more and more it was quite a feat the army recently announced that it wants to replace the interceptor system with improved body armor and will hold an open design competition the announcement came as the justice and defense departments opened a joint investigation into possible fraud and insider trading at dhb brian hart struggled to wake he heard someone weeping panicked that one of his daughters down the hall was in trouble brian shook himself fully awake only then he says did he realize that it was he who was crying december  was bleak before john was killed in an ambushed convoy brian had accepted a new job in illinois with the company that had taken over the small pharmacy automation firm hed cofounded brian and alma had contracted to sell their house in bedford and buy one in illinois after johns death they scuttled the move their daughters then  and  couldnt stand to leave bedford where schoolmates not only knew their loss they shared it john a former camp counselor had taught a lot of kids in the small town how to swim brian negotiated a buyout with his employer but there was nothing he could do to stop his house sale the day the movers packed up their old house brian and alma had no idea where to send the boxes they put their dog in a kennel and prepared to spend christmas in a hotel at the last minute the wife of a bedford selectman  a member of the council brian had threatened to sue over the unitarians peace banner  found the harts a house to rent a friend showed up on their new front porch with a fully decorated christmas tree the unitarians pastor invited the harts to join them for sunday worship but brian resisted if i still had religious faith id use it brian says i guess lifes just kicked it out of me what i have faith in is good people and the power of individual good works he also believes in systems that work brians father had died years before because of a medication error brian says so brian helped invent a system for barcoding medications to reduce mistakes a natural problemsolver he shared in more than a dozen patents with no job to go to brian devoted himself to trying to make sure that the pentagon sped armored humvees to iraq i thought itll take six weeks maybe two months of working to fix this armor thing how hard can it be brian recalls when he sat in the living room of his rented home to listen to bushs state of the union address in january  brian was sure he was right the president promised to get the troops the resources they needed it wasnt long before brian stopped believing the pentagon blamed production delays for the slow pace of getting armored humvees to iraq brian met with a representative of the manufacturer who told him they could produce hundreds of additional armored humvees each month  if only the pentagon would issue purchase orders brian recalls then he learned that the administrations budget request for the next fiscal year didnt include any money for armoring existing humvees or trucks while were in a state of combat how could force protection be an unfunded army requirement and not in the presidents original budget submission rep rob simmons rconn asked pentagon officials during a house armed services committee hearing in june  we are executing the missions that have been given to us and the requirements have continued to escalate lieutenanat general joseph yakovac jr of the army acquisition corps responded hunter the committee chair asked brigadier general william catto of the marine corps systems command the same question when youre in a war fight and youve got these ieds blowing up and were taking fairly substantial casualties why would force protection such as uparmor ever be an unfunded requirement hunter wanted to know weve got military construction programs for things like gymnasiums and yet that money continues to flow into those programs which are peripheral to the war fight and it doesnt go to the fight that seems to me to be a major defect in this system would you agree with that yes sir catto said brian came up with his own answer he decided that the bush administration which he had helped elect was trying to hide the cost of war in an election year i felt there was a huge betrayal of the public trust  my trust brian says i decided that i was going to raise holy hell until people understood what was going on in march  brian held a news conference with representative martin t meehan dmass to insist that the army spend all funds already set aside for vehicular armor immediately rather than over months at first parish unitarian in bedford hundreds of people showed up for forums on the iraq war where brian and massachusetts politicians spoke brian and alma researched the issue of armor procurement in a very dispassionate way gibbons the congregations pastor says they did not seek out information in order to posture or bolster any preconceived notion they simply wanted to know the truth brian learned so much about armor that he sometimes spoke in more detail than people could take once when the harts were being interviewed on cnn and wearing earpieces to receive offcamera direction from the segment producer they heard the producer pleading with their interviewer to shut brian up he kept saying get him off get him off    pulleeeeeze get him off alma recalls laughing in july  congress passed legislation giving the administration  billion in emergency war funds  more than  billion of that to buy new armored vehicles primarily m humvees the harts went out to dinner to celebrate exhilaration proved fleeting soon they were receiving panicked calls and emails from relatives of national guardsmen the military was finally going to pay to systematically armor humvees  but not trucks surfing the web brian found grainy videos posted by insurgents displaying their successful attacks on us convoys in iraq the insurgents were just letting the armored humvees pass and then blowing up some unarmored truck right behind them brian says from the time the harts buried their son brian and alma had reassured each other with the same refrain well tackle this problem then well get on with our life well tackle that problem then well get on with our life standing in their kitchen one night brian looked at alma she recalls and said maybe this is our life you go to war with the army you have not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time defense secretary donald rumsfeld said in kuwait on december   john hart and david bernstein had been dead more than one year the defense secretarys remarks to guardsman and soldiers who wanted to know why they were riding around in old unarmored vehicles vulnerable to roadside bombs made headlines one national guardsman from tennessee told rumsfeld that he and his buddies had been left scrap metal and bulletproof glass from landfills to rig hillbilly armor rumsfeld responded that the military was producing extra armor for humvees and trucks as fast as possible but in the meantime soldiers would just have to cope with shortages three weeks later sgt nicholas pulliam  a national guardsman who lived near the harts in chelmsford mass arrived in kuwait publicity back home over rumsfelds remarks made little difference on the ground from what pulliam could see a machinist readying his units unarmored vehicles for the long convoy into iraq pulliam did the best he could he and his buddies found a crate of vintage flak jackets and stacked them atop humvees to try to shield the gunners who would be protecting the convoys we tied them up with rope and duct tape pulliam recalls we had no way to make anything better once in iraq at al taqaddum air base in anbar province pulliam found ample stocks of steel to weld real turrets but no direction from the brass on how to armor any vehicles but humvees he says we were on our own back in bedford brian started a blog which pulliam read whenever he got internet access one of brians first postings was his analysis of casualties for the first five weeks of  of the deaths for which brian could find the cause  percent had been killed by ieds brian heard that the radio jammers the us military used to try to stop insurgents from using cell phones and garagedoor openers to set off ieds were in short supply he posted a quote from rep gene taylor dmiss chiding rumsfeld because the military insisted that the number of jammers it had in iraq was classified information that number remains classified mr secretary not because the insurgents dont know how few are protected but because  im of the opinion  the american people would be appalled if they knew how few are protected brian had a terrible thought were spending  for each fully armored m humvee and were going to lose this war to guys with garagedoor openers he decided to use his sons death benefit from the us government to try to develop a robotic device to help soldiers push ieds off the road safely he and his brother a former marine set up a workshop in borrowed space in an industrial park their prototypes won them meetings with military procurement officials in washington but no contracts brian began investing his savings into improving their robots betting that his activism wouldnt hurt his chances of eventually selling them to the pentagon you have to believe that people will do the right thing in the end he says if you dont    well thats not a world i want to live in working furiously brian felt out of step with a seemingly complacent american public he reread martin luther kings letters from a birmingham jail and identified with the civil rights leaders frustration at the silence of good people brian started making antiwar speeches is it treason to state the obvious that occupiers stay and liberators leave he said june   at a forum at first parish unitarian in america we seem afraid to ask the president where osama bin laden is why intelligence analysts can lie with impunity why we were sent to iraq on halftruths    and how will we ever get out    we must hold our leaders and ourselves accountable it would be two months before another grieving parent cindy sheehan would go to crawford tex to try to confront the president brians speech was unusual enough at the time that it received coverage in the boston globe his activism alienated relatives in texas who remain staunch bush republicans he says theres virtually no communication anymore he says choking up as he speaks the president says one thing and i am telling them thats not the truth its unresolvable but brian had his fans pulliam was riding in a convoy one day when a fully armored humvee some distance ahead hit an ied the engine was destroyed but the armor did its job the men inside were bruised but in one piece pulliam knelt by the humvee holding a sign and had a buddy take a photo so he could email it to the harts thanks to brian  alma hart senator kennedy and everybody who cares for our wellbeing and makes an effort his sign said you have saved lives  courage i do not know if this quality exists in me but i hope when the time comes i will respond sgt steve hines a massachusetts state trooper sits in his living room in newburyport and reads aloud from his dead sons war diary army st lt derek hines  a star hockey player and west point graduate  was killed in afghanistan on september  the trooper stops reading to blow his nose we cry every day his wife sue says rocking herself while clutching a throw emblazoned west point it doesnt get better it really doesnt he was just a love like i tell people her husband says a good day is when i dont break down completely on this recent visit brian who has made it a point to contact other local families who have lost children in iraq sits on the sofa next to steve hines he asks the hineses about their sons body armor derek wasnt wearing protective side plates in his armor when he was shot under one arm he hadnt been issued side plates a study by the militarys top medical examiner craig t mallak has suggested that many soldiers and marines killed in iraq might have survived if they had been wearing more body armor than the pentagon provided during the first  months of the war  marines died with a primary lethal wound to the torso eighty percent of those  or  marines  were wounded in unprotected areas of the chest side upper arm or shoulder that might be potentially impacted by armor redesign according to an august  preliminary report on the medical examiners study mallak had been collecting lethal wound data from the start of the war but the marines did not commission the  study analyzing that data until december  mallak testified before congress that he completed his first preliminary report on the study  intended for the pentagon only  in march  and a second one in august yet it wasnt until after the new york times published a story on mallaks findings last january that the army awarded a  million contract to produce additional plates to better protect soldiers sides they basically found that they needed to have side plates brian says offering his take on the study to hines steve hines who wears body armor in his job with an antiterrorist unit at bostons logan international airport is unconvinced you have to be able to move the trooper says you cant be in a coat of armor    soldiers will take them out they wont wear them its  degrees over there questioning whether their son might still be alive if hed had better body armor is something steve hines says he doesnt do we dont do much hines says we just try to get through he turns his attention back to his sons war diary he flips through its pages tenderly he reads aloud a passage in which derek wrote that he had been lying in his bunk reading gen tommy frankss memoir american soldier  it started with a quote franks wrote i hope america never forgets the power of will the soldiers i am serving with have some will and it has manifested itself daily the harts leave emotionally wrung out welcome to my world brian says the next morning brian visits the only other bedford father who had lost a son in iraq on november   yearold marine lance cpl travis r desiato who grew up with john hart was searching for insurgents in a row of houses in fallujah he went through the door at the end of a hallway six insurgents opened fire for the next several hours fellow marines fought room to room sometimes face to face with insurgents to recover his body and send it home to bedford traviss father joe desiato meets with brian in a small examining room of his pediatric practice brian wants to know whether the protective plates of traviss body armor had shattered when fired upon one of traviss plates did shatter his father says but given the ferocity of the attack he doesnt believe better body armor could have saved him the pediatrician says he respects brians efforts to get the troops better armor but prefers to deal with his own grief by reflecting on the valor of young soldiers willing to die for their country and one another i think brian in forcing the armor to the vehicles has saved a number of peoples lives he says but it becomes a very delicate tightrope of how to be an activist without making it political and using your sons death as a tool to espouse your views and have anyone listen as the doctor speaks he sits beneath a print depicting don quixote literatures secular saint of worthy lost causes brian looking around the room asks the doctor if the kids he examines there ever remind him of travis all the time he answers i see kids yearolds getting in a car who have some mannerism like travis and i think my god then i have to think for a second you know thats not travis do you think it will always be like this joe brian asks i sure hope so desiato says i think as the years go by memories start to fade when little things come up you say travis would have said this or john would have done that or thats johns mannerism or thats traviss mannerism it brings back the memory and to be honest sometimes its a funny memory    i dont want to lose that so ill take some pain for some joy this is the actual flag that covered johns casket alma says lifting a triangular flag box from its permanent perch in a bay window of the harts living room which is decorated as a shrine to their dead son this is johns bronze star why brian wanted to know didnt the military award john a bronze star with a v for valor he disappeared into his cluttered home office and returned with a letter from one of johns commanding officers saying that their son had emptied his machine gun before he died while some grieving parents dont find it helpful to examine and reexamine the circumstances of their childs death brian doesnt want to stop asking he concedes that he might spend less time searching for answers and more time making money to help support his family yet brian says that nothing seems as important to him as his unpaid work to stop questioning stop trying to prevent the next casualties would feel in some way like he was leaving john behind so the harts live primarily off savings and almas work at a temp agency while brian keeps jousting at windmills when its man against machine man usually loses when he runs out of money brian says after one of brians public appearances a military officer who had been stationed at kirkuk air base when john died emailed that brian should file a freedom of information act asking for the military records on his sons death the officer had heard that there was to be a formal inquiry into the fatally illequipped convoy but the inquiry had never taken place brian says the militarys written response to his request stunned him the key records relating to his sons death  sworn statements given by survivors of the convoy the official afteraction report and photographs of the crash scene  had gone missing the government told brian in november so many guys died needlessly because of delays in getting them the right equipment and not one general has been fired over it brian says no one has been held accountable why on this day brians questions stretch on until dusk turns to dark outside the bay window where his sons medals rest and heads around the hart living room nod brian it is  oclock alma says exasperated people need to go to sleep i love this green brian says he and alma are walking hand in hand on lexington green it is dusk the next evening brian points to the statue of john parker who led the towns minutemen i love that statue over there is where paul revere rode he says pointing out battle road which leads to concord john when he was preparing for basic training used to run that road carrying  pounds of books in a rucksack this is where the revolution started brian says forty minutemen against  british twentytoone just facing off the farmers didnt give up brian comes often to the green he thinks about what it must have felt like to be one of those farmers you know you can only last so long and then somebodys got to come and help you he says brian thinks john must have known in his final moment how those farmers felt i think courage is fighting a battle that you know you are probably going to lose brian says i think thats what john did you realize you are going to lose that fight but you fight it anyway april witt is a staff writer for the magazine she and brian hart will be fielding questions and comments

d printing  additive manufacturing select page from d printing to the factory floor professor john hart tells us about mits upcoming additive manufacturing course by clare scott   hours ago  featured stories  share on tumblrmassachusetts institute of technology mit is well known for living up to its name as a center of technological education and research and additive manufacturing is one of the myriad areas of technology that the university focuses on it’s a pretty safe bet that any d printing course offered at mit is going to be thorough expertled and up to date with the most current information about this everchanging technology next week mit is offering a comprehensive course on additive manufacturing for engineers designers scientists and anyone else who wants to become wellversed in the technology “additive manufacturing from d printing to the factory floor” is taking place from july st to august th and will be led by professor a john hart of mit’s mechanical engineering departmentwe had the opportunity to talk to professor hart about the course and he shared some information with us about what attendees can expect as well as his thoughts on d printing as a wholetell us a little about the course that will be taking place next week what kinds of concepts and technologies will be exploredjohn hart“our fiveday course at mit ‘additive manufacturing from d printing to the factory floor’ is a fastpaced handson experience that provides a comprehensive discussion of the technology and implications of additive manufacturing we begin by discussing the technology landscape industry direction and the digital workflow required for implementing additive manufacturing am and integrating with new developments in cad product lifecycle management and simulation the bulk of the course is then organized around detailed lectures lab activities and discussions addressing the fundamental processes properties and material capabilities of am the course covers a wide suite of materials polymers metals composites and biomaterials mainstream am processes and their derivatives and design for additive manufacturing dfam  with this strong set of fundamentals we are able to confidently address broader strategic implications of am – new business models cost and value analysis tools for procurement and production decisionmaking and valuedriven applications including shortrun production highperformance tooling and individually performance optimized parts across key industries”who can and should take this course“the technology and implications of am are important to engineers managers and strategic leaders alike including those from automotive aerospace medical energy consumer products electronics and other industries  some of the primary job titles we’ve had in the past include design engineers manufacturing engineers and product designers but the course is equally beneficial to anyone involved in business strategy or capital investment decisions the material covered is accessible to those that are new to am yet is also highlyvaluable to those who are wellversed in it both from a technical and business point of view”image mitwhat are your thoughts on the future of the additive manufacturing industry“we can now point to examples where am is influencing every stage of the product life cycle from first concept to production to postproduction service however we are still at the early stages of defining the true impact of am and as a result i believe many of the longterm implications of am are beyond our current imagination the industry of am materials machines and associated productsservices will continue to grow rapidly there will be mergers and consolidations as well as an increasingly diverse spectrum of amdriven startups as the cost and performance of am continue to advance the wider availability of the digital infrastructure of am design tools and production services will amplify its demand and push am to enable distributed ondemand production however we must also keep in mind that am is just one key component of digitallydriven advanced manufacturing”what do you see as the biggest hurdles to widespread adoption of additive manufacturinga student in one of john hart’s additive manufacturing courses image courtesy of john hartmit“one of the biggest hurdles is quality assurance manufacturers still lack protocols and processes to guarantee that parts and products produced via d printing will be of consistent quality strength and reliability in traditional manufacturing qualified materials used for casting and molding offer guarantees when it comes to part quality but that’s not the case with am – at least not yet further knowledge gaps on am’s potential need to be overcome engineers may understand am’s immediate benefits but lack the vocabulary necessary to translate the engineering value of am to leadership we also need quantitative tools to make informed decisions about am investments that take the myriad intangible costs eg the implications of distributed or bespoke manufacturing on warehouse costs or tariffs into consideration”in your opinion what are some of the major pros and cons of d printing“there are too many to name here not the least of which is flexibility d printing is frequently touted as ‘complexity for free’ as long as the item fits within the size of the printing area designers can produce complex geometries – including those impossible to fabricate using traditional methods – without a hefty upfront partspecific tooling investment when one presents the right design for am this is very true and in fact complexity is ‘more than free’ because a complex design that leverages am can be printed more quickly and with less material than an equivalent design intended for machining or moldingspeedtomarket is another important benefit am can accelerate new product development making it faster easier and less expensive to test new designs and prototypes avoiding tooling on the frontend permits greater design flexibility and lowers the financial risk that comes with a suboptimal design further am can complement the traditional product development process by producing the partspecific tooling jigs fixtures drillguides etc needed for mass manufacturing however the money you save in upfront capital investment costs can quickly be lost to material investments which are usually far greater than traditional stock metal or plastic molding this is one of the primary downsides to am materials are typically more expensive which can quickly flip the cost equation particularly at scale the upside is that new technologies are already overcoming these limitations – eg desktop metal’s new product line which leverages costeffective powder materials used in the metal injection molding industryproduction speed too is still lagging for am largely am is considerably slower than traditional massmanufacturing however throughput should be evaluated differently with am given the flexibility of am equipment to produce a variety of parts and the modularity that am brings to a production facility postprocessing eg annealing and surface finishing is almost always necessary to ensure parts can be used in a final application and this must be considered when estimating the cost and performance of am”john hart teaches a graduate course in additive manufacturing image courtesy of john hartmitis there anything else you would like to share“though mit is our home base for the course we aren’t limited to the classroom our course involves several labs and visits to local am demonstration facilities and machine manufacturers moreover boston is a hive of am related activity including startups software developers oems and industry titans in some cases we bring participants to them to let them see the machines in action in other cases we invite experts across the spectrum to the class to share their stories about new technologies and applications and give participants a chance to ask questions”you can learn more about “additive manufacturing from d printing to the factory

living up to its name as a center of technological education and research and additive manufacturing is one of the myriad areas of technology that the university focuses on it’s a pretty safe bet that any d printing course offered at mit is going to be thorough expertled and up to date with the most current information about this everchanging technology next week mit is offering a comprehensive course on additive manufacturing for engineers designers scientists and anyone else who wants to become wellversed in the technology “additive manufacturing from d printing to the factory floor” is taking place from july st to august th and will be led by professor a john hart of mit’s mechanical engineering departmentwe had the opportunity to talk to professor hart about the course and he shared some information with us about what attendees can expect as well as his thoughts on d printing as a wholetell us a little about the course that will be taking place next week what kinds of concepts and technologies will be exploredjohn hart“our fiveday course at mit ‘additive manufacturing from d printing to the factory floor’ is a fastpaced handson experience that provides a comprehensive discussion of the technology and implications of additive manufacturing we begin by discussing the technology landscape industry direction and the digital workflow required for implementing additive manufacturing am and integrating with new developments in cad product lifecycle management and simulation the bulk of the course is then organized around detailed lectures lab activities and discussions addressing the fundamental processes properties and material capabilities of am the course covers a wide suite of materials polymers metals composites and biomaterials mainstream am processes and their derivatives and design for additive manufacturing dfam  with this strong set of fundamentals we are able to confidently address broader strategic implications of am – new business models cost and value analysis tools for procurement and production decisionmaking and valuedriven applications including shortrun production highperformance tooling and individually performance optimized parts across key industries”who can and should take this course“the technology and implications of am are important to engineers managers and strategic leaders alike including those from automotive aerospace medical energy consumer products electronics and other industries  some of the primary job titles we’ve had in the past include design engineers manufacturing engineers and product designers but the course is equally beneficial to anyone involved in business strategy or capital investment decisions the material covered is accessible to those that are new to am yet is also highlyvaluable to those who are wellversed in it both from a technical and business point of view”image mitwhat are your thoughts on the future of the additive manufacturing industry“we can now point to examples where am is influencing every stage of the product life cycle from first concept to production to postproduction service however we are still at the early stages of defining the true impact of am and as a result i believe many of the longterm implications of am are beyond our current imagination the industry of am materials machines and associated productsservices will continue to grow rapidly there will be mergers and consolidations as well as an increasingly diverse spectrum of amdriven startups as the cost and performance of am continue to advance the wider availability of the digital infrastructure of am design tools and production services will amplify its demand and push am to enable distributed ondemand production however we must also keep in mind that am is just one key component of digitallydriven advanced manufacturing”what do you see as the biggest hurdles to widespread adoption of additive manufacturinga student in one of john hart’s additive manufacturing courses image courtesy of john hartmit“one of the biggest hurdles is quality assurance manufacturers still lack protocols and processes to guarantee that parts and products produced via d printing will be of consistent quality strength and reliability in traditional manufacturing qualified materials used for casting and molding offer guarantees when it comes to part quality but that’s not the case with am – at least not yet further knowledge gaps on am’s potential need to be overcome engineers may understand am’s immediate benefits but lack the vocabulary necessary to translate the engineering value of am to leadership we also need quantitative tools to make informed decisions about am investments that take the myriad intangible costs eg the implications of distributed or bespoke manufacturing on warehouse costs or tariffs into consideration”in your opinion what are some of the major pros and cons of d printing“there are too many to name here not the least of which is flexibility d printing is frequently touted as ‘complexity for free’ as long as the item fits within the size of the printing area designers can produce complex geometries – including those impossible to fabricate using traditional methods – without a hefty upfront partspecific tooling investment when one presents the right design for am this is very true and in fact complexity is ‘more than free’ because a complex design that leverages am can be printed more quickly and with less material than an equivalent design intended for machining or moldingspeedtomarket is another important benefit am can accelerate new product development making it faster easier and less expensive to test new designs and prototypes avoiding tooling on the frontend permits greater design flexibility and lowers the financial risk that comes with a suboptimal design further am can complement the traditional product development process by producing the partspecific tooling jigs fixtures drillguides etc needed for mass manufacturing however the money you save in upfront capital investment costs can quickly be lost to material investments which are usually far greater than traditional stock metal or plastic molding this is one of the primary downsides to am materials are typically more expensive which can quickly flip the cost equation particularly at scale the upside is that new technologies are already overcoming these limitations – eg desktop metal’s new product line which leverages costeffective powder materials used in the metal injection molding industryproduction speed too is still lagging for am largely am is considerably slower than traditional massmanufacturing however throughput should be evaluated differently with am given the flexibility of am equipment to produce a variety of parts and the modularity that am brings to a production facility postprocessing eg annealing and surface finishing is almost always necessary to ensure parts can be used in a final application and this must be considered when estimating the cost and performance of am”john hart teaches a graduate course in additive manufacturing image courtesy of john hartmitis there anything else you would like to share“though mit is our home base for the course we aren’t limited to the classroom our course involves several labs and visits to local am demonstration facilities and machine manufacturers moreover boston is a hive of am related activity including startups software developers oems and industry titans in some cases we bring participants to them to let them see the machines in action in other cases we invite experts across the spectrum to the class to share their stories about new technologies and applications and give participants a chance to ask questions”you can learn more about “additive manufacturing from d printing to the factory floor” here the first lecture from the professional course will be livestreamed here on july st
