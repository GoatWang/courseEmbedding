of technology is the partner on the studydata is expected in six monthscure pharmaceutical otcqbcurr is kicking off a firstever clinical study to research cannabinoid compounds to treat leukemia and prostate cancer specifically the company along with its partner technion  israel institute of technology will be testing to see if these cannabinoid molecules will attack tumorous cancer cells cure pharmaceutical is primarily a drug delivery company it is headquartered in oxnard california and is best known for its curefilm a thin oral film that helps medicine enter a patients bloodstream more quickly cure announced that it has entered into a partnership with technion research and development foundation to research different cannabinoid compounds to treat various types of cancer including prostate and leukemia its an area that hasnt received attention said rob davidson chief executive officer of cure there is strong anecdotal evidence but we want to put some science into it he said specifically cure would like to target tumor cells the israeli team which is a wholly owned subsidiary of technion  israel institute of technology will conduct the study but cure will identify the appropriate cannabinoid molecules to study this news comes on the heels of cure announcing earlier this month that it was going to enter into the pharmaceutical cannabis sector the idea is that the two teams will research and identify how varying cannabinoid compounds within cannabis strains can affect various cancer subtypes according to the companys press release cure can take that information to predict how to match a cancer subtype with an effective cannabis extract in order to get the best treatment results they are also looking at pairing the cannabis treatment with chemo cannabis is sometimes used by cancer patients for pain or nausea but not to treat the cancer itself technions lab group has already discovered two new pathways that have been activated by cannabis extracts in cancer cells the american cancer society says while the studies so far have shown that cannabinoids can be safe in treating cancer they do not show that they help control or cure the disease more recently scientists reported that thc and other cannabinoids such as cbd slow growth andor cause death in certain types of cancer cells growing in lab dishes the group supports the need for more scientific research on cannabis and cancer davidson said that they should have some data points in the first six months first well do an invitro study and see the effects on cancer cells he said we can get into human trials pretty quickly in israel the strategy will be to develop new chemical entities out of this research and potentially effective therapeutics for multiple indications cure plans to patent these molecules and will be pursuing the proper channels with the food and drug administration fda normally the initiation of a study isnt considered newsworthy because it is the results of the study that are more significant yet several doctors expressed their support of the study bonnie goldstein formerly chief resident at los angeles childrens hospital said i currently take care of many patients both adults and children that have lifethreatening advanced cancers and so far i have been unable to match cannabis treatment to the patients specific cancer subtype initial studies show that different cancers respond to the antineoplastic effects of different cannabinoids this research will answer this question and will allow physicians like myself to tailor treatment for cancer patients cure pharmaceutical hasnt been a public company for very long in november of  the company engaged in a reverse takeover of makkanoti group a greek paper bag company and changed the companys symbol cure pharmaceutical was originally incorporated in  and is still a very early stage company revenues for the first quarter of  were only  whereas expenses were  million total assets are only  million so it will be critical for the company to either raise additional capital or quickly turn these plans into revenue producers cure pharmaceutical hit a years high of  and is currently trading at approximately  a share in the otc market the company has a market value of  million with  million outstanding shares the short interest in the stock has dropped by  as of april if cure gets the positive results it is hoping for and is able to capitalize on this data quickly it will help the company get its cannabis business off the ground however study results cant be guaranteed and like any biotech company if the study doesnt generate the data it is hoping for then it has spent over  on a test that didnt pan out the way it wanted with short interest dropping it seems other investors are willing to take a shot on this company also a good result on this study will be beneficial to all cbd makers in the market and they are no doubt watching the results as well disclosure iwe have no

collection is remote any future recoveries are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts   impairment of longlived assets   longlived assets include equipment and intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives we assess the carrying value of our longlived asset groups when indicators of impairment exist and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable when compared to undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset   indicators of impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the assets or in our business strategy loss of or changes in customer relationships and significant negative industry or economic trends when indications of impairment arise for a particular asset or group of assets we assess the future recoverability of the carrying value of the asset or asset group based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis if carrying value exceeds projected net undiscounted cash flows an additional analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group typically a discounted cash flow analysis and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value over fair value there was no impairment on our longlived assets during the three months ended march   for the year ended december   the company wrote off  of patents   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the fasb asc  revenue recognition asc

and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded when it is “more likelythannot” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized        table of contents

valuation allowance of  has been established due to the uncertainty of the company’s realization of the net operating loss carry forward prior to its expiration   stockbased compensation   stockbased compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the sharebased payment topic of asc  which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period the asc also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grantdate fair value of the award   pursuant to asc topic  for sharebased payments to consultants and other thirdparties compensation expense is determined at the “measurement date” the expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award until the measurement date is reached the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain the company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date   fair value measurements   the company adopted the provisions of asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements   the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments   asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable level  — inputs that are unobservable for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions   the company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis   basic and diluted loss per share   basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period common equivalent shares which consist of stock options and warrants have been excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation because their effect is antidilutive   going concern   the company’s financial statements are prepared using us gaap applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company had an accumulated deficit at march   of  the company had a working capital of  as at march   these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable the company is continually analyzing its current costs and is attempting to make additional cost reductions where possible we expect that we will continue to generate losses from operations throughout         table of contents   cure pharmaceutical holding corp notes to condensed consolidated financial statements march   unaudited   in order to continue as a going concern and to develop a reliable source of revenues and achieve a profitable level of operations the company will need among other things additional capital resources management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through borrowing andor sales of equity and debt securities however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   recently issued standards   in

uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated

and was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in nicosia cyprus   on november   the board of directors and the majority stockholder of the then outstanding shares of registrant’s common stock executed a written consent to change registrant’s name from makkanotti group corp to cure pharmaceutical holdings corp the certificate of amendment to articles of incorporation was filed with the state of nevada on november     cure pharmaceutical corporation   our wholly owned subsidiary and operating business cure pharmaceutical located in oxnard california was originally incorporated in july  as a developer of advanced oral thin film “otf” for the delivery of nutraceutical overthecounter “otc” and prescription products for human and veterinary markets we utilize drug delivery technologies to develop and commercialize new applications of proven therapeutics through our curefilm™ technology as well as through sublingual and transdermal applications our exclusive micro encapsulation of drug actives allows for a higher volume of an active and if required multiple actives to be produced on a single otf strip we expect this technology will allow us to produce a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical otc and nutraceutical products   our product   curefilm™ technology and value proposition   typical forms of drug delivery that consumers have been familiar with over the years include tablets capsules chewables gummies and more recent developments such as melts and sublingual drops and sprays we believe that we are one of the companies at the forefront of otf drug delivery technology our otf product is about the size of a postage stamp using a matrix that maximizes the amount of “active” drug that can be delivered via otf   our curefilm™ technology consists of patented patent pending and trade secrets in two areas otf – core technology sublingual technology and transdermal skin technology   our proprietary multilayer curefilm™ allows dosages of many pharmaceutical otc and nutraceutical products to be put onto a small strip applied to the cheek buccal or under the tongue sublingual we believe that what sets us apart from the competition is our proprietary patented curefilm™ technology multilayer systems and formulation technologies that   · consists of two components  a liquidbased film layer that contains and stabilizes the active ingredients and a powder matrix layer · provides improved stability as well as delivery of active ingredients · contains functional qualities to include extra flavoring ingredients pliability enhancers and mucosal permeation enhancers   in a twolayer strip the layers are designed to work together in combination with the powder composition the powder composition can be varied as can the mucoadhesion properties of the strips to alter the dissolution and absorption rates of the medicament a complete multilayer system allows for increased stability higher loading of active ingredients and increased taste and palatability        table of contents   another recent advancement in our curefilm™ technology utilizes microencapsulation of selected active ingredients in the microencapsulation process microscopic particles or droplets envelop the active ingredients to protect and shield them the technique used in the microencapsulation process depends on various factors including the physical and chemical properties of the active ingredients this microencapsulation technology has allowed the delivery of higher dosing with better flavor masking   we have various types of curefilm™ dietary supplement products that are being commercialized and developed these include   commercialized   · macustrip vitamin complex eye health product · id life sleep melatonin · electrolyte adult and pediatric · e berry caffeine · hangover relief   in development   · aspirin · loratadine · tadalifil · sildenafil · loperamide · vitamin b · vitamin d · folic acid   clinical development   we partner with pharmaceutical companies looking for new methods to deliver drug actives under section b of the food drug and cosmetic act “b” the fda may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage dosage form route of administration or combination the b pathway is also the regulatory approach to be followed if an applicant intends to file an application for a product containing a drug that is already approved by the fda for a certain indication and for which the applicant is seeking approval for a new indication or for a new use the approval of which is required to be supported by new clinical trials other than bioavailability studies we have implemented a strategy under which we actively look for such socalled “repurposing opportunities” and determine whether our proprietary curefilm™ technology adds value to the product   we currently have five such drug repurposing projects in our development pipeline although there can be no assurance that such projects will be fully developed the companies we partner with are typically responsible for managing the regulatory approval process of the product with the fda andor other regulatory bodies as well as for the marketing and distribution of the products on a casebycase basis we may be responsible for providing all or part of the documentation required for the regulatory submission   in addition to pursuing partnering arrangements that provide for the full funding of a drug development project we may undertake development of selected product opportunities until the marketing and distribution stage we would first assess the potential and associated costs for successful development of a product and then determine at which stage it would be most prudent to seek a partner balancing costs against the potential for higher returns later in the development process we currently have five of such potential drug candidates in our product pipeline all of which are in the formulation development and preclinical phase of development however there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully develop market and distribute otf products for these drug candidates        table of contents   competition   we face competition from other companies academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies many of our competitors including monosol biodelivery sciences international intelgenx and lts lohmann will have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we have our success will be based in part on our ability to build obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy   the otf manufacturing industry is relatively new having only emerged over the last ten years although currently there are just a handful of current players within this industry we expect that we will be subject to competition from numerous other companies that currently operate or are planning to enter the markets in which we compete to date among manufacturers of otf some medications that either are or have been available by otf manufacturers in the marketplace include   · zuplenz the first oral soluble film approved by the fda as a prescription medication · benadryl diphenhydramine product and antihistamine used for allergies and mild sedative · gasx simethicone product for bloating gas and gastrointestinal complaint · melatonin pm hormonal product sold as a “dietary supplement” marketed for insomnia · orajel kids benzocaine product for dental pain · suboxone buprenorphine and naloxone fixed dosage combination product for opioid addiction · subutex buprenorphine product for opioid addiction · sudafed phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine product for nasal congestion · theraflu combination product of pain reliever antipyretic and decongestant · triaminic children’s antitussive product   the barriers to enter this market are the “know how’s” of developing and formulating consumer desired products which taste great also the high cost of entry by companies who have no expertise in the market makes entry by competitors risky since the technology to develop product is expensive and proprietary the key factors affecting the development and commercialization of our drug delivery products are likely to include among other factors   · the safety and efficacy of our products · the relative speed with which we can develop products · generic competition for any product that we develop · our ability to defend our existing intellectual property and to broaden our intellectual property and technology base · our ability to differentiate our products · our ability to develop products that can be manufactured on a cost effective basis · our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with cgmp and any other regulatory requirements and · our ability to obtain financing   in order to establish ourselves as a viable industry partner we plan to continue to invest in our research and development activities and in our manufacturing technology expertise in order to further strengthen our technology base and to develop the ability to manufacture our curefilm™ products ourselves at competitive costs our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business   significant employees   we currently have no significant employees   office   our office located at  beacon place oxnard california  our phone number is     government regulation   we will be required to comply with all regulations rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities we do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business        table of contents   results of operations   revenues for the three months ended march   and    revenues for the three months ended march

statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states “us gaap” requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see note  – “summary of significant accounting policies” although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or condition   impairment of longlived assets   longlived assets include equipment and intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives we assess the carrying value of our longlived asset groups when indicators of impairment exist and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable when compared to undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset   indicators of impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the assets or in our business strategy loss of or changes in customer relationships and significant negative industry or economic trends when indications of impairment arise for a particular asset or group of assets we assess the future recoverability of the carrying value of the asset or asset group based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis if carrying value exceeds projected net undiscounted cash flows an additional analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group typically a discounted cash flow analysis and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value over fair value there was no impairment on our longlived assets during the three months ended march   for the year ended december   the company wrote off  of patents   going concern   the company has an accumulated deficit balance as of march   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable the company is continually analyzing its current costs and is attempting to make additional cost reductions where possible we expect that we will continue to generate losses from operations throughout the remainder of    in order to continue as a going concern and to develop a reliable source of revenues and achieve a profitable level of operations the company will need among other things additional capital resources management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through borrowing andor sales of equity and debt securities however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   offbalance sheet arrangements   as of the date of this quarterly report we do

are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march   based on this assessment management concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as a result of the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below in making this assessment management used the framework set forth in the report entitled internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission or coso the coso framework summarizes each of the components of a company’s internal control system including i the control environment ii risk assessment iii control activities iv information and communication and v monitoring   identified material weakness   a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or the financial statements will not be prevented or detected management identified the segregation of duties as a material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of march   as of march   we had one fulltime employee with the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting as a result there is a lack of proper segregation of duties necessary to ensure that all transactions are accounted for accurately and in a timely manner as our resources allow we will add financial personnel to our management team
