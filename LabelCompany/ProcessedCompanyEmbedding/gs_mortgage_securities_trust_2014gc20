mortgagebacked securities mbs are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage loans most commonly on residential property mortgage loans are purchased from banks mortgage companies and other originators and then assembled into pools by a governmental quasigovernmental or private entity the entity then issues securities that represent claims on the principal and interest payments made by borrowers on the loans in the pool a process known as securitization most mbss are issued by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae a us government agency or the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac us governmentsponsored enterprises ginnie mae backed by the full faith and credit of the us government guarantees that investors receive timely payments fannie mae and freddie mac also provide certain guarantees and while not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government have special authority to borrow from the us treasury some private institutions such as brokerage firms banks and homebuilders also securitize mortgages known as privatelabel mortgage securities mortgagebacked securities exhibit a variety of structures the most basic types are passthrough participation certificates which entitle the holder to a prorata share of all principal and interest payments made on the pool of loan assets more complicated mbss known as collaterized mortgage obligations or mortgage derivatives may be designed to protect investors from or expose investors to various types of risk an important risk with regard to residential mortgages involves prepayments typically because homeowners refinance when interest rates fall absent protection such prepayments would return principal to investors precisely when their options for reinvesting those funds may be relatively unattractive   modified july   stay connected  twitter  facebook rss youtube  flickr

mortgage securities trust series gc commercial mortgage passthrough certificates a detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release key rating drivers the affirmations are the result of the relatively stable pool performance of the pool the negative outlooks on classes e and xc are due to continued concerns surrounding two loans  which are located in houstons energy

conocophillips is expected to pay rent through its lease term increased submarket vacancy and the current state of the oil and gas industry could make it challenging for the property manager to

by a mortgage or collection of mortgages the mortgages are sold to a group of individuals a government agency or investment bank that securitizes or packages the loans together into a security that investors can buy the mortgages of an mbs may be residential or commercial depending on whether it is an agency mbs or a nonagency mbs in the united states they may be issued by structures set up by governmentsponsored enterprises like fannie mae or freddie mac or they can be privatelabel issued by structures set up by investment banks the structure of the mbs may be known as passthrough where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the mbs holder or it may be more complex made up of a pool of other mbss other types of mbs include collateralized mortgage obligations cmos often structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits and collateralized debt obligations cdos the shares of subprime mbss issued by various structures such as cmos are not identical but rather issued as tranches french for slices each with a different level of priority in the debt repayment stream giving them different levels of risk and reward tranches—especially the lowerpriority higherinterest tranches—of an mbs arewere often further repackaged and resold as collaterized debt obligations these subprime mbss issued by investment banks were a major issue in the subprime mortgage crisis of – the total face value of an mbs decreases over time because like mortgages and unlike bonds and most other fixedincome securities the principal in an mbs is not paid back as a single payment to the bond holder at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment monthly quarterly etc this decrease in face value is

securitizationedit value of mortgagebacked security issuances in usd trillions  source sifma statistics structured finance the process of securitization is complex and depends greatly on the jurisdiction within which the process is conducted among other things securitization distributes risk and permits investors to choose different levels of investment and risk the basics are mortgage loans mortgage notes are purchased from banks and other lenders and possibly assigned to a special purpose vehicle spv the purchaser or assignee assembles these loans into collections or pools the purchaser or assignee securitizes the pools by issuing mortgagebacked securities while a residential mortgagebacked security rmbs is secured by singlefamily or two to fourfamily real estate a commercial mortgagebacked security cmbs is secured by commercial and multifamily properties such as apartment buildings retail or office properties hotels schools industrial properties and other commercial sites a cmbs is usually structured as a different type of security than an rmbs these securitization trusts may be structured by governmentsponsored enterprises as well as by private entities that may offer credit enhancement features to mitigate the risk of prepayment and default associated with these mortgages since residential mortgage holders in the united states have the option to pay more than the required monthly payment curtailment or to pay off the loan in its entirety prepayment the monthly cash flow of an mbs is not known in advance and an mbs therefore presents a risk to investors in the united states the most common securitization trusts are sponsored by fannie mae and freddie mac us governmentsponsored enterprises ginnie mae a us governmentsponsored enterprise backed by the full faith and credit of the us government guarantees that its investors receive timely payments but buys limited numbers of mortgage notes some private institutions also securitize mortgages known as privatelabel mortgage securities issuances of privatelabel mortgagebacked securities increased dramatically from  to  and then ended abruptly in  when real estate markets began to falter an example of a privatelabel issuer is the real estate mortgage investment conduit remic a taxstructure entity usually used for cmos among other things a remic structure avoids socalled double taxation advantages and disadvantagesedit the securitization of mortgages in the s had the advantage of providing more capital for housing at a time when the demographic bulge of baby boomers created a housing shortage and inflation was undermining a traditional source of housing funding the savings and loan associations or thrifts which were limited to providing uncompetitive  interest rates on savings accounts and consequently losing savers money to money market funds unlike the traditional localized inefficient mortgage market where there might be a shortage or surplus of funds at any one time mbss were national in scope and regionally diversified however mortgagebacked securities also led inexorably to the rise of the subprime industry and created hidden systemic risks they also undid the connection between borrowers and lenders historically less than  of people lost their homes to foreclosure but with securitization once a lender sold a mortgage it no longer had a stake in whether the borrower could make his or her payments historyedit among the early examples of mortgagebacked securities in the united states were the farm railroad mortgage bonds of the midth century which contributed to the panic of  there was also an extensive commercial mbs market in the s us governmentedit as part of the new deal following the great depression the us federal government created the federal housing administration fha with the national housing act of  to assist in the construction acquisition and rehabilitation of residential properties the fha helped develop and standardize the fixedrate mortgage as an alternative to the balloon payment mortgage by insuring them and helped the mortgage design garner usage in  the government also created the governmentsponsored corporation fannie mae to create a liquid secondary market in these mortgages and thereby free up the loan originators to originate more loans primarily by buying fhainsured mortgages as part of the housing and urban development act of  fannie mae was split into the current fannie mae and ginnie mae to support the fhainsured mortgages as well as veterans administration va and farmers home administration fmha insured mortgages with the full faith and credit of the us government in  the federal government authorized fannie mae to purchase private mortgages—that is those not insured by the fha va or fmha and created freddie mac to perform a role similar to that of fannie mae ginnie mae does not invest in private mortgages securitizationedit ginnie mae guaranteed the first mortgage passthrough security of an approved lender in  in  freddie mac issued its first mortgage passthrough called a participation certificate composed primarily of private mortgages in  fannie mae issued its first mortgage passthrough called a mortgagebacked security in  freddie mac issued the first collateralized mortgage obligation in  the government enacted the real estate investment trust act to allow the creation of the real estate investment trust reit to encourage real estate investment and in  bank of america issued the first private label passthrough in  the federal reserve board amended regulation t to allow brokerdealers to use passthroughs as margin collateral equivalent to overthecounter nonconvertible bonds in  the government passed the secondary mortgage market enhancement act to improve the marketability of private label passthroughs which declared nationally recognized statistical rating organization aarated mortgagebacked securities to be

financial institutions such as depository banks and insurance companies unless overridden by state law before october  which  states did and department of labor–regulated pension funds the tax reform act of  allowed the creation of the taxexempt real estate mortgage investment conduit remic special purpose vehicle for the express purpose of issuing passthroughs the tax reform act significantly contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the s and s that resulted in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  which dramatically changed the savings and loan industry and its federal regulation encouraging loan origination subprime mortgage crisisedit lowquality mortgagebacked securities backed by subprime mortgages in the united states caused a crisis that played a major role in the – global financial crisis by  the market for highquality mortgagebacked securities had recovered and was a profit center for us banks typesedit most bonds backed by mortgages are classified as an mbs this can be confusing because a security derived from an mbs is also called an mbs to distinguish the basic mbs bond from other mortgagebacked instruments the qualifier passthrough is used in the same way that vanilla designates an option with no special features subtypes of mortgagebacked security include passthrough securities are issued by a trust and allocate the cash flows from the underlying pool to the securities holders on a pro rata basis a trust that issues passthrough certificates is taxed under the grantor trust rules of the internal revenue code under these rules the holder of a passthrough certificate is taxed as a direct owner of the portion of the trust allocatable to the certificate in order for the issuer to be recognized as a trust for tax purposes there can be no significant power under the trust agreement to change the composition of the asset pool or otherwise to reinvest payments received and the trust must have with limited exceptions only a single class of ownership interests a residential mortgagebacked security rmbs is a passthrough mbs backed by mortgages on residential property a commercial mortgagebacked security cmbs is a passthrough mbs backed by mortgages on commercial property a collateralized mortgage obligation or paythrough bond is a debt obligation of a legal entity that is collateralized by the assets it owns paythrough bonds are typically divided into classes that have different maturities and different priorities for the receipt of principal and in some cases of interest they often contain a sequential pay security structure with at least two classes of mortgagebacked securities issued with one class receiving scheduled principal payments and prepayments before any other class paythrough securities are classified as debt for income tax purposes a stripped mortgagebacked security smbs where each mortgage payment is partly used to pay down the loans principal and partly used to pay the interest on it these two components can be separated to create smbss of which there are two subtypes an interestonly stripped mortgagebacked security io is a bond with cash flows backed by the

security po is a bond with cash flows backed by the principal repayment component of property owners mortgage payments there are a variety of underlying mortgage classifications in the pool prime mortgages are conforming mortgages with prime borrowers full documentation such as verification of income and assets strong credit scores etc alta mortgages are an illdefined category generally prime borrowers but nonconforming in some way often lower documentation or in some other way vacation home etc alta mortgages tend to be larger in size than subprime loans and have significantly higher credit quality for example an alta loan might be to an individual with multiple and varying sources of income nonowner occupied investment properties are often alta loans because alta loans are not conforming loans they are not eligible for purchase by fannie mae or freddie mac subprime mortgages generally have weaker credit scores as well as little to no verification of income or assets high debttoincome ratios etc jumbo mortgage when the size of the loan is bigger than the conforming loan amount as set by fannie mae or freddie mac as such the mortgage rates on jumbo loans are somewhat higher than for conforming loans these types are not limited to mortgage backed securities bonds backed by mortgages but that are not mbss can also have these subtypes there are two types of classifications based on the issuer of the security agency or government issued securities by governmentsponsored enterprise issuers such as fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac sell short term – month bills at auction on a weekly schedule and longerterm – year notes at monthly auctions the underlying mortgages for agency mbs are one to foursingle family residential mortgages only nonagency or privatelabel securities by nongovernmental issuers such as trusts and other special purpose entities like real estate mortgage investment conduits the underlying mortgages for nonagency mbs are backed by second mortgage loans manufactured housing loans and a variety of commercial real estate loans in addition to single family residential mortgages secondary mortgage marketedit the secondary mortgage market is the market where a network of lenders sell and investors buy existing mortgages or mbs a large percentage of newly originated mortgages are sold by their originators into this large and liquid market where they are packaged into mbs and sold to public and private investors including fannie mae freddie mac pension funds insurance companies mutual funds and hedge funds because of the longterm nature of mortgages the secondary market is an essential factor in maintaining lender liquidity the infusion of capital from investors provides mortgage lenders such as banks thrifts mortgage bankers and other loan originators with a market for their loans in addition to providing liquidity and increasing overall efficiency the secondary market can smooth out geographic credit disparities however in some respects particularly where subprime and other riskier mortgages are involved the secondary mortgage market may exacerbate certain risks and volatility tbasedit tbas—short for tobeannounced securities—involve a special type of trading of mortgagebacked securities tbas are the most liquid and important secondary mortgage market with volume in the trillions of dollars annually tbas are traded by mbs traders with notional amounts there are settlement days when the traders have to make good on their trades at that time they choose fractions from various pools to make up their tba only agency mortgagebacked securities trade in the tba market in a tba transaction the parties agree on a price for delivering a given volume of agency passthrough mortgagebacked securities at a specified future date the distinguishing feature of a tba transaction is that the actual identity of the securities to be delivered at settlement is not specified on the date of execution “trade date” instead the parties to the trade agree on only five general parameters of the securities to be delivered issuer mortgage type maturity coupon and month of settlement tbas are critical in determining the ultimate interest rates that mortgage borrowers pay since mortgage originators can lock in rates and use tbas to hedge their exposure tbas are also used to hedge many nontba eligible mortgage products such as hybrid arms and nonagency mortgages covered bondsedit main article covered bond in europe there exists a type of assetbacked bond called a covered bond commonly known by the german term pfandbriefe covered bonds were first created in thcentury germany when frankfurter hypo began issuing mortgage covered bonds the market has been regulated since the creation of a law governing the securities in germany in  the key difference between covered bonds and mortgagebacked or assetbacked securities is that banks that make loans and package them into covered bonds keep those loans on their books this means that when a company with mortgage assets on its books issues the covered bond its balance sheet grows which would not occur if it issued an mbs although it may still guarantee the securities payments usesedit risk return rating  yield relate there are many reasons for mortgage originators to finance their activities by issuing mortgagebacked securities mortgagebacked securities transform relatively illiquid individual financial assets into liquid and tradable capital market instruments allow mortgage originators to replenish their funds which can then be used for additional origination activities can be used by wall street banks to monetize the credit spread between the origination of an underlying mortgage private market transaction and the yield demanded by bond investors through bond issuance typically a public market transaction are often a more efficient and lowercost source of financing in comparison with other bank and capital markets financing alternatives allow issuers to diversify their financing sources by offering alternatives to more traditional forms of debt and equity financing allow issuers to remove assets from their balance sheet which can help to improve various financial ratios utilize capital more efficiently and achieve compliance with riskbased capital standards the high liquidity of most mortgagebacked securities means that an investor wishing to take a position need not deal with the difficulties of theoretical pricing described below the price of any bond is essentially quoted at fair value with a very narrow bidoffer spreadcitation needed reasons other than investment or speculation for entering the market include the desire to hedge against a drop in prepayment rates a critical business risk for any company specializing in refinancing criticismsedit critics have suggested that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors ability to monitor risks and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards private competitive mortgage securitization is believed to have played an important role in the us subprime mortgage crisis in addition off–balance sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer are said to make the securitizing firms leverage less transparent thereby facilitating risky capital structures and allowing credit risk underpricing off–balance sheet securitizations are believed to have played a large role in the high leverage ratio of us financial institutions before the financial crisis market size and liquidityedit as of the second quarter of  there was about

passthrough mbs and they form the basis for computing cash flows from that mortgage passthrough just as this article describes a bond as a year bond with  coupon rate this article describes a passthrough mbs as a  billion passthrough with  passthrough rate a  wac and month wam the passthrough rate is different from the wac it is the rate that the investor would receive if heshe held this passthrough mbs and the passthrough rate is almost always less than the wac the difference goes to servicing costs ie costs incurred in collecting the loan payments and transferring the payments to the investors to illustrate these concepts consider a mortgage pool with just three mortgage loans that have the following outstanding mortgage balances mortgage rates and months remaining to maturity loan outstanding mortgage balance mortgage rate remaining months to maturity percentage of pools total  balance the loans weighting loan      loan      loan      overall pool  wac  wam   weightedaverage maturityedit the weightedaverage maturity wam of a passthrough mbs is the average of the maturities of the mortgages in the pool weighted by their balances at the issue of the mbs note that this is an average across mortgages as distinct from concepts such as weightedaverage life and duration which are averages across payments of a single loan the weightings are computed by dividing each outstanding loan amount by total amount outstanding in the mortgage pool ie  these amounts are the outstanding amounts at the issuance or initiation of the mbs the wam for the above example is computed as follows wam   ×    ×    ×          months another measure often used is the weightedaverage loan age weightedaverage couponedit the weightedaverage coupon wac of a passthrough mbs is the average of the coupons of the mortgages in the pool weighted by their original balances at the issuance of the mbs for the above example this is wac   ×    ×    ×          theoretical pricingedit pricing a vanilla corporate bond is based on two sources of uncertainty default risk credit risk and interest rate ir exposure the mbs adds a third risk early redemption prepayment the number of homeowners in residential mbs securitizations who prepay increases when interest rates decrease one reason for this phenomenon is that homeowners can refinance at a lower fixed interest rate commercial mbs often mitigate this risk using call protection since these two sources of risk ir and prepayment are linked solving mathematical models of mbs value is a difficult problem in finance the level of difficulty rises with the complexity of the ir model and the sophistication of the prepayment ir dependence to the point that no closedform solution ie one that could be written down is widely known in models of this type numerical methods provide approximate theoretical prices these are also required in most models that specify the credit risk as a stochastic function with an ir correlation practitioners typically use specialised monte carlo methods or modified binomial tree numerical solutions interest rate risk and prepayment riskedit theoretical pricing models must take into account the link between interest rates and loan prepayment speed mortgage prepayments are usually made because a home is sold or because the homeowner is refinancing to a new mortgage presumably with a lower rate or shorter term prepayment is classified as a risk for the mbs investor despite the fact that they receive the money because it tends to occur when floating rates drop and the fixed income of the bond would be more valuable negative convexity in other words the proceeds received would need to be reinvested at a lower interest rate hence the term prepayment risk professional investors generally use arbitragepricing models to value mbs these models deploy interest rate scenarios consistent with the current yield curve as drivers of the econometric prepayment models that models homeowner behavior as a function of projected mortgage rates given the market price the model produces an optionadjusted spread a valuation metric that takes into account the risks inherent in these complex securities  there are other drivers of the prepayment function or prepayment risk independent of the interest rate such as economic growth which is correlated with increased turnover in the housing market home prices inflation unemployment regulatory risk if borrowing requirements or tax laws in a country change this can change the market profoundly demographic trends and a shifting risk aversion profile which can make fixed rate mortgages relatively more or less attractive credit riskedit main article credit risk the credit risk of mortgagebacked securities depends on the likelihood of the borrower paying the promised cash flows principal and interest on time the credit rating of mbs is fairly high because most mortgage originations include research on the mortgage borrowers ability to repay and will try to lend only to the creditworthy an important exception to this is nodoc or lowdoc loans some mbs issuers such as fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae guarantee against homeowner default risk in the case of ginnie mae this guarantee is backed with the full faith and credit of the us federal government this is not the case with fannie mae and freddie mac but these two entities have lines of credit with the us federal government however these lines of credit are extremely small compared to the average amount of money circulated through these entities in one days business additionally fannie mae and freddie mac generally require private mortgage insurance on loans in which the borrower provides a down payment that is less than  of the property value pooling many mortgages with uncorrelated default probabilities creates a bond with a much lower probability of total default in which no homeowners are able to make their payments see copula although the risk neutral credit spread is theoretically identical between a mortgage ensemble and the average mortgage within it the chance of catastrophic loss is reduced if the property owner should default the property remains as collateral although real estate prices can move below the value of the original loan this increases the solidity of the payment guarantees and deters borrower default if the mbs was not underwritten by the original real estate and the issuers guarantee the rating of the bonds would be much lower part of the reason is the expected adverse selection against borrowers with improving credit from mbss pooled by initial credit quality who would have an incentive to refinance ultimately joining an mbs pool with a higher credit rating realworld pricingedit because of the diversity in mbs types there is wide variety of pricing sources in general the more uniform or liquid the mbs the greater the transparency or availability of prices most traders and money managers use bloomberg and intex to analyze mbs pools and more esoteric products such as cdos although tools such as citis the yield book and barclays point are also prevalent across wall street especially for multi–asset class managers some institutions have also developed their own proprietary software tradeweb is used by the largest bond dealers the primaries to transact round lots  million and larger complex structured products tend to trade less frequently and involve more negotiation prices for these more complicated mbss as well as for cmos and cdos tend to be more subjective often available only from dealers for vanilla or generic year pools fnfggn with coupons of – one can see the prices posted on a tradeweb screen by the primaries called to be allocated tba this is due to the actual pools not being shown these are forward prices for the next  delivery months since pools have not been cut only the issuing agency coupon and dollar amount are revealed a specific pool whose characteristics are known would usually trade tba plus  ticks or a payup depending on characteristics these are called specified pools since the buyer specifies the pool characteristic heshe is willing to pay up for the price of an mbs pool is influenced by prepayment speed usually measured in units of cpr or psa when a mortgage refinances or the borrower prepays during the month the prepayment measurement increases if the lovina acquired a pool at a premium  as is common for higher coupons then they are at risk for prepayment if the purchase price was  the investor loses  cents for every dollar prepaid which may significantly decrease the yield this is likely to happen as holders of highercoupon mbss have a good incentive to refinance conversely it may be advantageous to the bondholder for the borrower to prepay if the lowcoupon mbs pool was bought at a discount  this is due to the fact that when the borrower pays back the mortgage he does so at par so if the investor bought a bond at  cents on the dollar as the borrower prepays he or she gets the full dollar back and his or her yield increases however this is unlikely to happen as borrowers with lowcoupon mortgages have very little incentive to refinance the price of an mbs pool is also influenced by the loan balance common specifications for mbs pools are loan amount ranges that each mortgage in the pool must pass typically highpremium highcoupon mbss backed by mortgages with an original loan balance no larger than  command the largest payups even though the borrower is paying an above market yield he or she is dissuaded from refinancing a small loan balance due to the high fixed cost involved low loan balance   mid loan balance – high loan balance – super high loan balance – tba   the plurality of factors makes it difficult to calculate the value of an mbs security often market participants do not concur resulting in large differences in quoted prices for the same instrument practitioners constantly try to improve prepayment models and hope to measure values for input variables implied by the market varying liquidity premiums for related instruments and changing liquidity over time make this a difficult task one factor used to express price of an mbs security is the pool factor recording and mortgage electronic registration systemsedit one critical component of the securitization system in the us market is the mortgage electronic registration systems mers created in the s which created a private system wherein underlying mortgages were assigned and reassigned outside of the traditional countylevel recording process the legitimacy and overall accuracy of this alternative recording system have faced serious challenges with the onset of the mortgage crisis as the us courts flood with foreclosure cases the inadequacies of the mers model are being exposed and both local and federal governments have begun to take action through suits of their own and the refusal in some jurisdictions of the courts to recognize the legal authority of mers assignments the assignment of mortgage deed of trust and note obligation to pay the debt paperwork outside of the traditional us county courts and without recordation fee payment is subject to legal challenge legal inconsistencies in mers originally appeared trivial but they may reflect
