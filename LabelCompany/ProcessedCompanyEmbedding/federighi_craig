story a firsttime wearables user reviews the fitbit alta hr advertisement apple invited a handful of journalists to cupertino to talk about the future of the mac platform the mac pro is receiving a minor update this week but the most significant updates are coming later this year or even later you have already read the news but we thought we would also use this opportunity to share a transcript of the interview with phil schiller senior vice president of worldwide marketing craig federighi senior vice president of software engineering john ternus vice president of hardware engineering bill evans from apple pr was also in attendance it was lightly edited for length and clarity and does not include some small asides and comments made off the record transcription anthony ha brian heater greg kumparak phil schiller we’re here to talk about the mac the mac is doing really well we’re really proud of how things are going we’ve been in general over the last decade growing faster than the pc industry last year we had a little bit of a setback and then this year back to growth again and growing faster than the industry it’s something we plan to keep on doing for a very long time some numbers that are pretty powerful — or meaningful to us anyway the mac user base is approaching  million users a lot of customers it’s nearing a  billion of annual run rate and based on that it is close to being a fortune  company all by itself as a business the number of users is super important to us it always has been always will be this is an unusual thing to get together like this laughter this is inbetween a product announcement there’s no black cloth that’s going to come off of something right now that’s not why we’re here while those moments are really fun we thought it deserved a moment to talk about the mac and particularly the mac for our pro users we’ll talk about what’s going on and frankly be a little more transparent with some of the things we’re doing some of the places we’re going because our pro users desire that and we care deeply about them and we’re dedicated to communicating well with them and helping them understand what we’re doing and what we’re up to we want to be as transparent as we can for our pro users and help them as they make their buying decisions they invest so much in the mac we want to support them and we care deeply about them so that’s why we’re here we’ve certainly been getting feedback from a specific group of users in particular desktop mac pro users we’ve been listening to that we’ve been talking to them we’ve actually been going out meeting with a lot of pro customers to understand how they use our products what their workflow is like things they might need so we certainly understand a lot about them there’s always more to learn but we understand a lot about them we’ve been thinking deeply about what we should be doing and how we should be doing that and that’s a little bit of what we want to communicate today one of the interesting things through all this has been the feedback on macos it’s been so positive it is in general across our mac user base — but specifically amongst our pro customers the feedback on macos has been off the charts they love the mac they love macos they love it as a pro workflow they love it as a pro app environment there certainly always is feedback on what we could do better but in general the love for macos is incredibly strong and that’s a great thing to hear we want to reiterate that quite a while ago a great matrix was drawn on the wall with four quadrants in it this product matrix a very brilliant clear view of what we should do we want to make sure everyone understands that not only do we continue to believe in the mac but we believe in that product quadrant strategy we believe in filling every one of those boxes with great products the best products available for every one of those segments — so to the extent that anyone doubts whether we believe in that view anymore they shouldn’t we continue to believe in that and we want to excel in every one of those quadrants craig federighi do you want to touch a little bit on how the pro audience has sort of redistributed themselves around that quadrant it’s sort of shifted over the years… phil schiller yeah yeah first of all when we talk about pro customers it’s important to be clear that there isn’t one prototypical pro customer pro is such a broad term and it covers many many categories of customers and we care about all of these categories and there’s a variety of different products those customers want there’s music creators there’s video editors there’s graphic designers — a really great segment with the mac there’s scientists engineers architects software programmers — increasingly growing particularly our app development in the app store so there are many many things and people called pros pro workflows so we should be careful not to over simplify and say ‘pros want this’ or ‘don’t want that’ it’s much more complex than that as we look over our business on the mac a couple things that are really fascinating we’ve certainly said for a long time that apple’s a mobile company it’s mobile because of iphone mobile because of ipad but the mac is predominantly a mobile business as well just to update the latest with  percent notebooks to desktop sales if anyone’s interested in that as we see the mac business rebound a lot of the strength of that is in the mobile products in fact our brand new macbook pro is in q was about  percent growth year over year from the previous year so again our notebooks are doing really really well so as we look at the mac at the pro customers there’s so many definitions of them one of the things we looked at was the mix of products they use from us and the mix of applications they use and how do you kind of get a handle on who’s a pro who isn’t if you look at it from an application perspective what we find is that about  percent of our mac customers use what you’d categorize as a professional application on a weekly or even multipletimesaweek basis that’s a kind of customer you could look at and say there’s someone who’s job probably relies on the work they do – using pro apps multiple times a week that’s a pretty large percent —  percent and then if you look at a little broader view customers who use pro applications less frequently than once a week that’s almost  percent of our customer base across all of that as we’ve said we’re a more mobile than desktop company of the people who use pro apps and define themselves as pros our largest product used by those customers are notebooks notebooks are by far and away our most popular systems used by pros second on the list is imacs — used by pros again by the people who use professional software day in day out not just casually third on the list is mac pro now mac pro is actually a small percentage of our cpus — just a single digit percent however we don’t look at it that way the way we look at it is that there is an ecosystem here that is related so there might be a single digit percentage of pros who use a mac pro there’s that  percent base that use pro software frequently and  percent who use it casually and that these are related these are not distinct little silos there’s a connection between all of this john gruber daring fireball i just want to make sure i understand the stat right is it single digit percentage of pros who use mac pros or of all macs phil schiller of all macs… are mac pros presumably the predominant use of that is by pros there may be some that aren’t so we see the largest use of portables then imac then mac pro but we don’t think it’s a scenario where… this segment isn’t important to these other segments these things are related and the fact that pro software can touch  percent of the polled mac customer base is significant and important in the fact that it’s related to the  percent that use it frequently and the single digit percent that use mac pros we do think there’s a connection here and an importance to all of that obviously as you know we just did a very major update to the macbook pro line that’s going very well customers absolutely love it we’ve had a lot of customers buying them big numbers as i said  percent growth year over year we’re very proud of those products we know there’s feedback on things that can be done better on them there’s things that we want to do better on them we know they matter to our pro customers and we have every intention to advance that mac book pro line in the years ahead and make it better and better for our core customers but we think we’re off to a good start there next up we have plans on imac to move that line ahead and do great things on imac it’s core to our mac business and our customers including making configurations of imac specifically with the pro customer in mind and acknowledging that our most popular desktop with pros is an imac we want to do things with the imac in the future to help address those pro needs and make it… not only continue but more of a capable machine for pro customers craig federighi that is a pretty incredible evolution that we’ve seen over the last decade the original imac you never would’ve thought as remotely touching pro uses and now you look at today’s k imac top configs it’s incredibly powerful and a huge fraction of what would’ve traditionally required the mac pros of old and are being well addressed by imac — whether its audio editing video editing graphics arts and so forth but there’s still even further we can take imac as a high performance pro system and we think that form factor can address even more of the pro market phil schiller with regards to the mac pro we are in the process of what we call ‘completely rethinking the mac pro’ we’re working on it we have a team working hard on it right now and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements and we’re committed to making it our highestend high throughput desktop system designed for our demanding pro customers with regards to the mac pro we are in the process of what we call ‘completely rethinking the mac pro’— phil schiller as part of doing a new mac pro — it is by definition a modular system — we will be doing a pro display as well now you won’t see any of those products this year we’re in the process of that we think it’s really important to create something great for our pro customers who want a mac pro modular system and that’ll take longer than this year to do in the interim we know there are a number of customers who continue to buy our current mac pro to be clear our current mac pro has met the needs of some of our customers and we know clearly not all of our customers none of this is black and white it’s a wide variety of customers for some it’s the kind of system they wanted for others it was not in the meantime we’re going to update the configs to make it faster and better for their dollar this is not a new model not a new design we’re just going to update the configs we’re doing that this week we can give you the specifics on that the cpus we’re moving them down the line the gpus down the line to get more performance per dollar for customers who do need to continue to buy them on the interim until we get to a newly architected system craig federighi i think it’s fair to say part of why we’re talking today is that the mac pro — the current vintage that we introduced — we wanted to do something bold and different in retrospect it didn’t well suit some of the people we were trying to reach it’s good for some it’s an amazingly quiet machine it’s a beautiful machine but it does not address the full range of customers we wanna reach with mac pro we wanted to do something bold and different in retrospect it didn’t well suit some of the people we were trying to reach— craig federighi maybe john ternus can talk briefly about some of the elements that led us there and what the implications are… but we have work to do to build a machine now that we know the full breadth of our pro market needs john ternus i think one of the foundations of that system was the dual gpu architecture and for certain workflows certain classes of pro customers that’s a great solution but to phil’s point ‘pro’ is so broad that it doesn’t necessarily fit all the needs of all the pros the way the system is architected it just doesn’t lend itself to significant reconfiguration for somebody who might want a different combination of gpus that’s when we realized we had to take a step back and completely rearchitect what we’re doing and build something that enables us to do these quick regular updates and keep it current and keep it state of the art and also allow a little more in terms of adaptability to the different needs of the different pro customers lance ulanoff mashable i’m just curious at what point did you realize that i remember the big launch and seeing it and i remember similar words ‘this is something completely new and different we’re really redoing this’ and we were all thinking ‘wow this is hot’ we were all excited about the exterior in particular but at what moment in the product cycle did you think ‘oh… this is maybe not the end all be all’ did that happen six months ago where did you get the telemetry that told you that craig federighi i’d say longer than six months ago but i think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner if you will we designed a system that we thought with the kind of gpus that at the time we thought we needed and that we thought we could well serve with a two gpu architecture… that that was the thermal limit we needed or the thermal capacity we needed but workloads didn’t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped being able to put larger single gpus required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate so it became fairly difficult to adjust at the same time so many of our customers were moving to imac that we saw a path to address many many more of those that were finding themselves limited by mac pro through a next generation imac and really put a lot of our energy behind that in retrospect that was… while that system is going to be fantastic for a huge number of customers we want to do more we did not fully come to terms with our need to do more until later than we’d like with the implication that the nextgeneration mac pro that many of our customers — well some of our customers it’s relatively small in the grand scheme of things but a very important group of our customers want — until quite a while from now matthew panzarino techcrunch if point a is when you’re thinking ‘uhoh we need to do this’ or ‘no no but we need to make a new mac pro’ and point b is when it’s coming out why is there a gap is the cpu the gateway there or is it just design — you need more runup to get it right i know obviously this generation of cpu that’s hitting this year probably won’t provide you a significant enough bump…is that a consideration or part of the consideration john ternus i think mostly it’s just getting the time to do the design right make sure we land with an architecture and a design that has legs that we’re really sure is the right thing… we design something it takes time for us to build the products we build so it’s not so much about the cpu it’s more about the overall system ina fried axios do you expect to be able to continue manufacturing in the us that was the other big piece with the mac pro… phil schiller yeah we’re not ready to talk about that yet further down the line we’d be happy to before we go into more questions a couple of other things i didn’t want to miss hitting on about the software now and then we do get some questions about strategy and software for pros i just want to reiterate our strong commitment there as well both with final cut pro  and logic  there are teams on those software products that are completely dedicated to delivering great pro software to our customers no foot off the gas there they’ve been certainly listening a lot to customer feedback doing a lot of updates they’ve been very well received we think we’re on good paths there and the customers are by and large really happy with the direction and the support they’ve been getting and that’s going to continue no plan on slowing that down one bit a growing group for us is software developers we’re obviously responsible for software tools and sdks and much more there and we’re continuing to invest in that all the way from languages to compilers to tools etc our dedication remains really strong on all of that craig federighi i think if you use xcode downloads as a metric it’s possible software developers are actually our largest pro audience it’s growing very quickly its been fantastic phil schiller lastly i’ll just say that with the current generation mac pro which some customers love others… may not one of the things that’s certainly clear and true about that was the team set out to do something different something bold and we always want to encourage the mac team that whatever products you make to make customers happy that we do bold work because the mac has always been about that it’s been about not doing conventional thinking not ‘me too’ stuff so the team certainly has been spending a lot of time with customers to understand what better would fit most workflows to take the time to do something great and something inspired and that we’re proud to put the name macintosh on i think we hit most of the points we wanted to make and i’m sure you have lots more burning questions john ternus during a roundtable conversation with journalists on the mac inside the machine shop at apple’s product realization lab john gruber daring fireball right out in the lobby was the original imac g with the display on a hinge that one would you compare the mac pro and the need to completely rethink it to that i remember when the imac g was introduced the narrative was ‘the most obvious thing to do with a flat panel is to stick a computer on the back we didn’t want to do that’ and then it ends up that the real future of the imac was ‘here’s a beautiful display with a computer on the back’ is it similar you had a great idea and a couple of us were saying that we loved that design but obviously it wasn’t… is it a similar sort of angle an alley worth taking when you realize it’s a dead end phil schiller i wouldn’t want to make that exact analogy because it presupposes a lot of things that may not be correct i think that the simple answer is as we’ve said we made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our mac pro users and what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others enough so that we need to take another path one of the good things hopefully with apple through the years has been a willingness to say when something isn’t quite what we wanted it to be didn’t live up to expectations to not be afraid to admit it and look for the next answer there are many examples of that but there’s examples of that philosophy but not so much the details the details are quite different craig federighi i think initially certainly from a market reception point of view the current mac pro design was well received it wasn’t that sales fell off at all but the architecture over time proved to be less flexible to take us where we wanted to go to address that audience in hindsight we would’ve done that differently now we are lance ulanoff mashable the limitation that we’re talking about you keep talking about architecture how much of that is tied to actual design i remember the triangle on the inside and the cone on the outside were very much tied together how much of the limitations that you’re talking about are connected to that design john ternus the triangle you mentioned the thermal core is designed to have three fairly similar loads – similarly balanced in power and so the overall size of the product and the fan that defines the overall thermal capacity for the enclosure and we didn’t see as much take up in dual gpus and we would have expected it served its purpose well and created a really quiet and powerful machine using it for a certain class of things it just didn’t necessarily have the flexibility that we need to have— john ternus and certainly there’s other applications where it’s not necessarily the right thing so for certain classes a single bigger gpu would actually make more sense but that architecture doesn’t really support that the way the product was constructed was with these three balanced loads in mind so again it served its purpose well and created a really quiet and powerful machine using it for a certain class of things it just didn’t necessarily have the flexibility that we need to have matthew panzarino techcrunch you probably did market research you mentioned you went out to pros and talked to them what applications did you find were the most lacking obviously with a single heavyload gpu people were saying ‘i wish i had a gpu with gb of ram and a bunch of cpu cycles on it that i could just load up fully with this task’ and you’re thinking ‘this machine will never be suited to that because of the thermal properties’ who were those people talking to you who told you ‘this is what we want’ john ternus i think some of the science and technology of those types of applications certainly craig federighi there’s certain scientific loads that are very gpu intensive and they want to throw the largest gpu at it that they can there are heavy d graphics or graphics and compute that mix loads those can be in vr those can be in certain kinds of highend cinema production tasks where most of the software out there that’s been written to target those doesn’t know how to balance itself well across multiple gpus but can scale across a single large gpu matthew panzarino techcrunch we had like  years of cpuforward thinking and in the last few years gpu computation has become much more central john ternus and it’s certainly growing at a faster rate than cpus as well lance ulanoff mashable going back to what you were talking about with the imac and the macbook pro – when you talk about a mac prospecific display with whatever you do as the box maybe they’re altogether would you consider a touch display phil schiller no laughter we’ve talked a lot about touch on the mac it’s certainly as we’ve talked to pros not a big request for things they would want in a mac pro and not the problems that they most want us to solve and then of course there’s the whole other discussion we’ve had many times about why we believe that macos and ios are distinct and each optimized to be best at what they’re best at that’s a whole other long discussion we can get into but suffice it to say it’s not a big need of the mac pro customers that we’re trying to address you mentioned again and how we’re talking about both the imac and macbook – i do think that we have a twoprong desktop strategy we think both imac and mac pro are going to be important for pro desktops ina fried axios you mentioned touch when microsoft showed off the surface studio a lot of people were like ‘wow microsoft’s out there looking at the next generation of creative pros’ is there a segment of creative pros that you think do want something that can tilt down and they can use a stylus with you guys have always said you’re going to focus on a few things but do you think this segment of creative people exists or is it just not of interest in general phil schiller there’s two parts first we’ve been talking to mac pro users – and the rest of the pro users imac users macbook pro users this does not even register on the list of things they’re most interested in that we talked about gpus storage portability and many different things all of which that has nothing to do with so that’s not very important craig federighi i would say that talking to some of those same people in video production illustration and so forth they are very excited with the ipad in that context the ipad pro the pencil seem to have really hit the mark with that audience and they are not saying ‘why can’t i do that on my mac pro’ they’re really excited to take advantage of it on the ipad so that’s absolutely an area where we want to continue to make the ipad more and more capable phil schiller exactly so that kind of a product you’re referencing isn’t a great pro desktop for the things they’re asking us for it is not — in terms of performance expandability and all of those things and as a drawing surface we think it’s a compromised product as well compared to what we’ve done with ipad pro and the performance it delivers and the portability it delivers and the ability to directly interact with it it’s a better form factor and that’s an example of the bigger topic we still think that mac makes for the best personal computer operating system because it is designed around that first and foremost — with its cocoa interface its indirect manipulation with a mouse its trackpad and the things you do let us design a system best used for those kinds of applications and ios with its cocoa touchbased experience is built all around that and is based on the system best optimized for that so we can make the best of each rather than a lowest common denominator that would compromise each craig federighi we all certainly use both so we’re really focused on making them work well together because we think in many tasks that’s actually the best solution so all of our customers should feel free to buy multiple products laughter we encourage that ina fried axios we’ve seen over time you leading the industry and getting more and more performance out of arm everyone looks at the curves going up as you guys look at different trends that are taking over do you see armbased chips playing a role in desktops and macs in the future craig federighi we’ve actually see that a little bit already with the t i think we called it but it brings some of the authentication the secure enclave processor for instance out of our iphone socs and makes them available on the mac so we see a really interesting complementary role for our silicon working with intel and we certainly work with intel on our needs to deliver chips into our mac roadmap and we see that continuing john ternus but it’s obviously a huge opportunity for us to have what i think is probably the best silicon design team in the world so we can bring those applespecific features into the mac ina fried axios it sound like you see that for the near future being a complementary role versus — craig federighi correct matthew panzarino techcrunch the touch bar’s been out and people have been poking at it and i’m sure you guys have been anonymously recording pokes based on your learnings are you seeing that as having a place in the imac or the mac pro the paradigm of a combination of an interactive changeable display and physical keys phil schiller we think we’re off to a good start with the touch bar that it is intuitive for everybody in general and specifically does give some incredible capabilities for pro users and as we’ve started to see more and more adoption in pro apps our own – obviously logic supports it as does final cut and thirdparty apps have done a real good job starting to support it we’re seeing some really brilliant uses of it and we think that this is a good path that we’re on the opportunity to integrate touch where it can most add additional value in the mac experience is the smart way to go just as we’ve made the trackpad better at gestures and a really smooth intuitive experience we think that’s a great place to go with touch and that’s what the touch bar is we’re still going to learn a lot more it hasn’t been that long that it’s been out there and we’re still trying to learn and gather data from customers – research mostly and a lot of different interview with customers and we’re going to learn and we think if we’re right this is a great direction for the mac john gruber daring fireball how do you square the fact that the pros’ needs vary greatly with the fact that you guys don’t offer a wide range of hardware if you want the latest range of macbook pros you’re getting one that’s a lot thinner and lighter even though some pros really need the most battery life that they can possibly get phil schiller well you know that we’ve always tried to strike that balance between meeting as large a group of users’ needs as possible while making the fewest number of products that enable that so we can put energy into making them really great great performance great quality great innovative features if you dilute too far those become counterproductive with each other so we work hard at trying to do both and sometimes we nail it and sometimes we go back to the drawing board and try harder so that’s what we have to do we have to try to make the product line that meets most users’ needs as varied as those needs may be i think as you talk about the pro user the fact that our user base is split over notebooks allinone desktops and modular desktops is important we aren’t making one machine for pros we’re making three different designs for pros we’re going to continue to matthew panzarino techcrunch i don’t want to get too personal but what was the moment you came to the realization that the mac pro that you had dreamed was not this design what did that feel like how did that happen who goes ‘it’s time to rethink this’ phil schiller i wish i could give you the kind of answer you want with that which is ‘oh there was a day and a meeting and we all got together and said x’ but it rarely works that way craig federighi we all went on our own emotional journeys i’d say laughter there were periods of denial and acceptance we all went on that arc john ternus there definitely wasn’t a single point looking at how things are doing looking at what we can do within the space and eventually come to a conclusion but it’s not like it’s an aha moment ina fried axios to follow up on that i assume some of those collective realizations came when you guys wanted to update it and you looked around and said ‘if we’re going to do an update this is what people want you can’t do that i’m not sure shoving mhz faster dualgpu helps that much so we’ll just leave it’ i assume just from the outside looking at the product cycle there had to be those sorts of meetings craig federighi there definitely were that’s absolutely right lance ulanoff mashable is there a difference in the way these pro products are designed and developed as compared to an apple watch where form follows function or function follows form which is driving it sounds like on the pro side you’ve got a lot more of the function you’ve got the pro needs come first and then you wrap something around it i don’t know if that was the case when the mac pro was designed but is there a difference john ternus the process for how we design things is largely the same we go through the process with all of our products certainly how you make the tradeoffs and the priorities you have in a certain product are going to be different based on the products you’re trying to address so a inch macbook pro we’re pushing really hard to get the most performance we can do in the form factor that’s the way we want it we want it to be light we want it to be portable we want it to be beautiful obviously you make a different set of tradeoffs when you’re building a inch macbook the product serves a different need so the goals are different craig federighi the requirements for the capability of the system do provide constraints that drive the design process so there’s a balance in there but when we built the original mac pro we said ‘how much aggregate graphics compute do we think this system needs to have’ and we came up with an architecture that said ‘we can split it across two gpus that are both pretty thermally efficient and we want this thing to be silent as well’ what i think we didn’t appreciate completely at the time was how we had so tailordesigned that specific vision at the time that in the future we would find ourselves a bit boxed in to a circular shape we were boxed by a circle— craig federighi but we didn’t start with a shape and say ‘here’s the fastest machine we can put in that box’ we actually started with a target for performance and came up with what i think was a very clever design of that thermal core and thermal architecture to accommodate what we thought was the right power architecture what i think we didn’t appreciate completely at the time was how we had so tailordesigned that specific vision at the time that in the future we would find ourselves a bit boxed in to a circular shape we were boxed by a circle laughter ina fried axios one other takeaway is that pros value a couple of things – well they value a lot of things the two times i can remember apple designing a really cool product that didn’t necessarily meet a broad audience are this and the cube powermac g cube and the lesson was that they value that expandability more options is it a lesson now that you guys are beginning to think about the next thing that it needs to be more traditionally shaped and traditionally open craig federighi i wouldn’t say we’re trying to paint any picture right now about a shape it could be an octagon this time laughter but certainly flexibility and our flexibility to keep it current and upgraded we need an architecture that can deliver across a wide dynamic range of performance and that we can efficiently keep it up to date with the best technologies over years i think it’s a strength of the company that we see new technologies creating new opportunities we tend to try to jump on those pretty aggressively and so you look at that architecture of that mac pro it had great thunderbolt external io and we said ‘this is a great opportunity to change what had been a conventional build a big card rack and slot a bunch of cards in there’ we said ‘a lot of this storage can be achieved with very high performance with thunderbolt so we built a design in part around that assumption as well some of the pro community has been sort of moving that direction but we had certainly in mind the need for expandability if you wanted a great raid solution in there it probably made a lot more sense to put it outside the box than actually be constrained within the physical enclosure that contained the cpu so i think we went into it with some interesting ideas and not all of them paid off matthew panzarino techcrunch what’s your philosophy on external gpus craig federighi i think they have a place matthew panzarino techcrunch seems like it would have offered the maximum flexibility in the space where you would never have to worry about thermal problems theoretically as long as the external gpu was built right john ternus i think there’s some aspects of them where they’re going to be beneficial and there’s some workloads where they’re going to be less effective john gruber daring fireball there’s a contingent of the pro market – i have friends who are in it and i hear from people who read the site their theory is that apple doesn’t care about mac pro users anymore they certainly care very much about ipad pro users in broad strokes their theory is that apple wants everyone to switch to ipads and that the mac has some sort of end of life on the horizon are you aware of this group of users who at least have this theory i know you’re going to say it’s not true at least i think you are but are you aware that reasonable people – not conspiracy theorists — because they’re looking at real evidence… phil schiller the mac has an important long future at apple apple cares deeply about the mac we have every intention to keep going and investing in the mac it’s important to us it’s important to our customers — including mac pro users all pro users including mac pro and if we’ve had a pause in upgrades and updates on that we’re sorry for that what happened with the mac pro and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it and that’s our intention we care about our pro users who use macbook pros who use imacs and who use mac pros who use modular systems as well as allinone systems who use the pro software we make it’s all important to us and we’re invested in that and we see a long future with that stuff the mac is — we say it over and over we’re saying it again here — a huge part of our future we’re deeply invested in it— craig federighi craig federighi we certainly see as i know you do a wide spectrum of views expressed in internet forums about all things including our products i think it’s not entirely unreasonable and it’s understandable that some people who love their macs so much and see something new that apple is talking about in the form of ipad creating in some of them a sense of insecurity ‘what does this mean there’s thing i really care about i don’t want to see it go away i see this other new thing on the scene what does this mean to me what does this mean to the product i love’ so i understand how that would come out in the form of concern that this is happening but this is not happening the mac is — we say it over and over we’re saying it again here — a huge part of our future we’re deeply invested in it john ternus some of our most talented folks working on it i mean quite frankly a lot of this company if not most of this company runs on macs craig federighi that’s right john ternus this is a company full of pro mac users phil schiller it’s a reasonable question and this is why we’re here today specifically to address that question above all else we’re committed to the mac we’ve got great talent on the mac both hardware and software we’ve got great products planned for the future and as far as our horizon line can see the mac is a core component of the things apple delivers including to our pro customers lance ulanoff mashable ports no brave decisions or courageous decisions on ports on the mac pro this is an audience that has more legacy stuff than anybody else can you make any promises or make any allowances for… craig federighi a serial ata port laughter an rs… phil schiller we’re not going to make any promise or anything that should be misinterpreted as ‘here’s what apple said they’re going to do in the future on the mac pro’ i will point out that we make decisions at a productbyproduct level — thinking about the ecosystem of how things work together but also at a product level just because on one product we remove something doesn’t mean we’re going to remove it from everything if it doesn’t make sense so there’s no reason to draw any conclusion for example saying what we choose to do on a macbook pro means that that’s all we will do on a desktop in the future that’s not a reasonable conclusion we make choices based on a variety of factors per product ina fried axios you talked a lot about the feedback you got on the mac pro there’s certainly been feedback — people like a lot of things about the new macbooks don’t love the battery life what would you say has been the pro feedback what have you learned from what pros are saying about the new macbook pros phil schiller first we’re still gathering a lot of feedback i wouldn’t say we’re done synthesizing all that we’re learning in general it’s been incredibly well received it is a popular product — in fact i think it’s one of the most popular pro notebooks we’ve made in our history in total the story’s really good it doesn’t mean there isn’t feedback there of things we can make better of course there is but in total the feedback’s really good as we’ve said there’s a lot of different kinds of pro users so we can’t over simplify but in general i think we’ve hit a real sweet spot with the product i think battery life was an early area where there was some feedback — that’s actually died down greatly not to say again that we can’t get better but many people are getting great battery life out of it it certainly is very competitive with anything in the industry stands up really well the balance of performance and battery life it gets in fact i read a really neat test over the weekend where we were the only notebook tested that met or exceeded its battery life claims everything else was pretty poor craig federighi like half phil schiller and so it was great to read that but we can continue to make things better but that’s been wellreceived generally there’s certainly been feedback about io i think the io has been for some great because of the performance it delivers and the flexibility it delivers others would like some legacy connectors but there are adapters for that we’re not done gathering feedback but generally things are going really well with it craig federighi and we did have some software issues particularly affecting the inch it could result on switching to the discrete gpu under circumstances where we shouldn’t have and then consuming power on the discrete gpu on levels that were in excess of what was appropriate which was responsible for some of the issues there since the fixes we put out in december i want to say the fleet battery the metrics for those who opted in to sending apple diagnostics the average increased by an hour on those systems in battery life and those systems despite the initial reaction externally those systems have considerably better battery life than the systems they replaced and so it was a little bit of a shock to us honestly we were so excited to put those machines out and deliver great battery life to our inch customers and then got that reaction from a subset of the users that were unhappy those systems have better battery life than any inch machine we’ve ever shipped and i’m glad we got the software fixes out there to let that machine shine to its full capability john paczkowski buzzfeed what about the mac mini it hasn’t come up once yet is there a reason phil schiller on that i’ll say the mac mini is an important product in our lineup and we weren’t bringing it up because it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use so we’re focusing today specifically on the things that are important to pros while there are some pro usage there’s also a lot of consumer uses so we aren’t covering it today the mac mini remains a product in our lineup but nothing more to say about it today if we haven’t communicated that we have a lot of people working on the mac — a lot of really brilliant people invested in great new products in both infrastructure and people — then we haven’t done our job here today because we do have a lot of resources on the mac and that’s gonna stay ina fried axios i don’t expect you to give us numbers but is the team growing is it the same as a while ago craig federighi on the software side it’s difficult to account for because our overall org has grown substantially over the last couple years more and more when you talk about work on the kernel or the security subsystems or the graphic architecture or the compiler or the rest of the developer tools even some of the sort of midtier objectoriented frameworks it’s all the same teams people externally have misconstrued ‘look what’s happening to the mac team they’re all together’ i mean they are — for good reasons for our developers we think we want a common platform at the lower level for a developer to build an app that could work on ios even tvos macos the differentiated bits are the higher level user environment and some of the highest level frameworks that target that user experience the number of people focused on the common technologies as well as the distinct technologies to each of those platforms has definitely grown over the last several years  shares featured stories is venture ready for robotics with manish

display function keys when running windows with boot camp friday october    am pdt by joe rossignol one of the biggest questions about the touch bar on apples new macbook pro is how it will work with windows through boot camp that led macrumors reader abraham to send an email to apples software engineering chief craig federighi who shared good news for dualbootersquestion from abraham craig am i correct in assuming that the touch bar becomes a row of visual function keys when using windows with boot camp federighis answer you are indeedpresumably this means the touch bar will likely display virtual function keys between ff along with an escape key when running windows it remains to be seen if there will be specific controls for systemlevel tasks such as volume playback and display brightness meanwhile the virtual power button should work but without touch id macrumors cannot fully confirm the authenticity of the email but it does appear to be sent by federighi through apples corporate servers based on full headers we saw apple executives occasionally respond to customer emails or it is possible the response was handled by apples executive relations or public relations teams boot camp is an apple utility that enables users to partition their ssds or hard drives and install windows directly on a mac allowing for macos and windows to be run side by side it differs

has so much potential for developers friday october    am pdt by joe rossignol youtube tech reviewer marques brownlee has shared an exclusive interview with apple senior vice president of software engineering craig federighi the pair chatted about the new macbook pro and its customizable touch bar which federighi said is going to be great and has so much potential for developers touch bar is a multitouch strip of glass that replaces the standard row of function keys on the new macbook pros providing users with systemlevel and appspecific controls that contextually change for example when a user types text in a document the touch bar might include controls for adjusting the font face and size macbook pro users can interact with the touch bar using gestures tapping activates a control such as a button or selects an item such as an emoji touching and holding initiates a secondary action on a control such as a button panning moves an element such as a slider of photos or emojis from sidetoside the questions and answers below were edited slightly for clarity and brevity why now why  for us to arrive at the touch bara lot of it came together in terms of the technology being just right to really pull this off in this kind of form factor — such as touch id and the quality of the display we wanted it to feel just completely native to the keyboard and completely real — and be so responsive we were able to take so much that weve learned in the hardware for ios devices — and even so much of the security model of ios like for touch id — and incorporate some of our custom silicon to make it happen a read full article •  comments apples phil schiller we dont design for price we design for the experience thursday october    pm pdt by juli clover following the launch of the

contextual oled touch bar on the new macbook pro which is its key feature has been in development under the direction of jony ive for at least two years and according to ive it marks a beginning of a very interesting direction for future products apples new macbook took so long to develop because the company didnt want to just create a speed bump aiming instead for something thats a big big step forward apple marketing chief phil schiller says the macbook pro will allow apple to create many things to come some of which we cant envision yet he also said apple isnt driven by a calendar but is instead aiming to create new innovations in the mac line many customers are unhappy with the high price of the new macbook pro models something schiller addressed in the interview an entrylevel inch macbook pro with a touch bar costs  a full  more than previousgeneration models and inch models start at  schiller says apple cares about price but has to design for experience rather than costaffordability is absolutely something we care about schiller says but we dont design for price we design for the experience and the quality people expect from mac sometimes that means we end up at

federighi eddy cue phil schiller and two siri scientists at the companys headquarters apple provided levy with a closer look at how machine learning is deeply integrated into apple software and services led by siri which the article reveals has been powered by a neuralnet based system since  apple said the backend change greatly improved the personal assistants accuracythis was one of those things where the jump was so significant that you do the test again to make sure that somebody didn’t drop a decimal place says eddy cue apple’s senior vice president of internet software and servicesalex acero who leads the siri speech team at apple said siris error rate has been lowered by more than a factor of two in many cases“the error rate has been cut by a factor of two in all the languages more than a factor of two in many cases” says acero “that’s mostly due to deep learning and the way we have optimized it — not just the algorithm itself but in the context of the whole endtoend product”acero told levy he was able to work directly with apples silicon design team and the engineers who write the firmware for ios devices to maximize performance of the neural network and federighi added that apple building both hardware and software gives it an incredible advantage in the spaceits not just the silicon adds federighi its how many microphones we put on the device where

interview with tim cook and eddy cue earlier in the week fast company today posted a lengthy new interview session with cue and craig federighi in which the two discussed apple maps the legacy of apple devices and learning from apples failures both cue and federighi admitted that everyone who works at the company has to be honest with ourselves whenever mistakes are brought up by the public usually following new product or software launches while some may see this as an exponentially increasing problem with apple cue points out that the quality issue appears bigger since the companys reach has expanded theres a higher bar apple has to achieve now and cue is okay with that when we were the mac company if we impacted  of our customers it was measured in thousands now if we impact  of our customers it’s measured in tens of millions that’s a problem right—things are going to be perceived differently our products are way better than they used to be but there’s a higher bar and i’m okay with that i think that is why we’re here that’s why i get up every day i like that people have high expectations of us and that they care about little things that bother them which in a lot of products they wouldn’t bother about with other companies you think that’s about as good as it’s going to be with us you want perfection you want it to be the best and we want that both of the apple

to create an environment that was less specific it got design out of the wayfederighi goes on to note that the technological advances over the past few years have finally reached the point where apple is able to tackle something like ios this is the first postretina display ui user interface with amazing graphics processing thanks to tremendous gpu graphics processing unit power growth so we had a different set of tools to bring to bear on the problem as compared to seven years ago when the iphone first launched he says before the shadowing effect we used was a great way to distract from the limitations of the display but with a display thats this precise theres nowhere to hide so we wanted a clear typography ive jumps in yes we wanted to defer to the content and just get out of the

craig federighi march   craig federighi is senior vice president of software engineering at apple he first joined apple in  as the head of software engineering at apple i think nothing is more important than the safety of all of our customers even as we strive to deliver delightful experiences to users of iphones ipads and macs our team must work tirelessly to stay one step ahead of criminal attackers who seek to pry into personal information and even coopt devices to commit broader assaults that endanger us all sadly these threats only grow more serious and sophisticated over time in just the past  months hackers have repeatedly breached the defenses of retail chains banks and even the federal government making off with the credit card information social security numbers and fingerprint records of millions of people but the threat to our personal information is just the tip of the iceberg your phone is more than a personal device in today’s mobile networked world it’s part of the security perimeter that protects your family and coworkers our nation’s vital infrastructure — such as power grids and transportation hubs — becomes more vulnerable when individual devices get hacked criminals and terrorists who want to infiltrate systems and disrupt sensitive networks may start their attacks through access to just one person’s smartphone that’s why my team works so hard to stay ahead  of  full screen autoplay close skip ad × apple a history of one of the world’s most valuable companies view photos here’s a look back some key moments in apple’s evolution caption a look back at the tech giant’s evolution   apple was founded in a garage by steve jobs pictured here and steve wozniak the young entrepreneurs brought different strengths to their fledgling company jobs had a flair for conceptualizing products while wozniak had the technical knowhow to make them happen in this  photo steve jobs introduces the apple ii one of the company’s early successes ap buy photo wait  second to continue the encryption technology built into today’s iphone represents the best data security available to consumers and cryptographic protections on the device don’t just help prevent unauthorized access to your personal data — they’re also a critical line of defense against criminals who seek to implant malware or spyware and to use the device of an unsuspecting person to gain access to a business public utility or government agency of course despite our best efforts nothing is  percent secure humans are fallible our engineers write millions of lines of code and even the very best can make mistakes a mistake can become a point of weakness something for attackers to exploit identifying and fixing those problems are critical parts of our mission to keep customers safe doing anything to hamper that mission would be a serious mistake that’s why it’s so disappointing that the fbi justice department and others in law enforcement are pressing us to turn back the clock to a lesssecure time and lesssecure technologies they have suggested that the safeguards of ios  were good enough and that we should simply go back to the security standards of  but the security of ios  while cuttingedge at the time has since been breached by hackers what’s worse some of their methods have been productized and are now available for sale to attackers who are less skilled but often more malicious to get around apple’s safeguards the fbi wants us to create a backdoor in the form of special software that bypasses passcode protections intentionally creating a vulnerability that would let the government force its way into an iphone once created this software — which law enforcement has conceded it wants to apply to many iphones — would become a weakness that hackers and criminals could use to wreak havoc on the privacy and personal safety of us all i became an engineer because i believe in the power of technology to enrich our lives great software has seemingly limitless potential to solve human problems — and it can spread around the world in the blink of an eye malicious code moves just as quickly and when software is created for the wrong reason it has a huge and growing capacity to harm millions of people security is an endless race — one that you can lead but never decisively win yesterday’s best defenses cannot fend off the attacks of today or tomorrow software innovations of the future will depend on the foundation of strong device security we cannot afford to fall behind those who would exploit technology in order to cause chaos to slow

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
