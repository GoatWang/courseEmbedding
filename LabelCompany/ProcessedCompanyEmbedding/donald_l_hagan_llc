pipeline milestones in  however genericization of key drugs lost alliance revenues pricing pressure and rising competition remain potent headwinds mounting competition in the immunooncology market is also a significant concern meanwhile pfizer’s shares have underperformed the largecap pharma industry this year so far the company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters estimates have remained stable ahead of its q earnings release    bmo capital markets analysts commented we are highly confident the deal will close as the purchase agreement removes ip risk and development risks and creates significant shareholder value we believe there is minimal risk for the deal being blocked due to antitrust considerations ctp phase iia initiated with topline results expected q the phase iia trial will enroll approximately  patients spread across  active arms of differing doses    and  mg bid and a placebo comparator the primary endpoint for the trial will be measured using the severity of alopecia tool salt after patients undergo  weeks of dosing an additional  weeks of dosing of ctp is planned for all patients enrolled in the study if successfully developed we anticipate a significant pricing discount for ctp relative to jakafi – owned by incyte incy nonrated the earlier delay to initiate the trial due to clinical supply delays which lasted around  months has been resolved   ubs ag analysts commented  the fda approved novartis cdk agent kisqali ribociclib in firstline treatment for hrher metastatic breast cancer in combo with any aromatase inhibitor recall that monaleesa was stopped early and while interim data demonstrated a reduction in risk of disease progression or death by  over letrozole alone the mpfs had not been reached at the time for the first time the label presented a mpfs of  mos for kisqali  letrozole vs  mos for letrozole alone the  mos improvement over letrozole is essentially comparable to  mos improvement  mos for ibrance vs  mos for letrozole for pfizers ibrance given the strong interim data that were comparable to ibrance we believe the approval of kisqali was largely expected our takeaway label looks a little worse than ibrance overall we think the label looks slightly worse particularly on safety on the positive the label is broader as the indication is for use of kisqali in combo with anyaromatase inhibitors vs ibrance in combo with letrozole however as the vast majority of firstline use letrozole the broader label shouldnt meaningfully impact ibrance in our view were not clear on how kisqali got the broader label but we think this could be encouraging for ibrance as the ibrance label could also become as broad with the potential april approval of the confirmatory phase  paloma ibrance was approved under an accelerated pathway with phase  paloma data on safety the kisqali label warns of qt prolongation and liver tox which are not in the ibrance label we think the qt issue could put kisqali at a disadvantage thoughts on the stock shouldnt impact the stock much if anyibrance has been on the market for  years and has made significant headway to becoming a standard of therapy and we do not believe there was anything in the kisqali label that would meaningfully impact the significant lead that pfizer has in our cdk model we assign a  share for kisqali in  that goes to   and  in e
