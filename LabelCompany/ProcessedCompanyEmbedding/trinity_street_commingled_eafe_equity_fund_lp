“trinity street” or the “firm” is a londonbased investment manager that is authorised and regulated by the uk financial conduct authority “fca” and a registered investment adviser with the us securities and exchange commission “sec” trinity street is an independentlyowned investment boutique founded in  and focuses solely on managing global and international equity portfolios this document describes how trinity street has applied the seven principles of the uk stewardship code the “code” which is overseen and published by the financial reporting council below we disclose the nature of our commitment to the code and where if at all we do not commit to the code we state clearly our alternative investment strategy – the code is applied on a “comply or explain” basis the code aims to enhance the quality of engagement between institutional investors and companies with the aim of improving longterm shareholder returns and encouraging enhanced corporate governance at portfolio investment companies code disclosure  the following sets forth the seven principles of the code and outlines how trinity street believes it fulfils each of those principles principle  institutional investors should publicly disclose their policy on how they will discharge their stewardship responsibilities at the heart of trinity street’s investment processes are activities that are at the core of and consistent with stewardship with our experienced portfolio managers engaging with investee companies and potential investee companies on strategy performance risk capital structure and corporate governance in particular trinity street considers it to be of paramount importance when assessing proxy voting responsibilities on behalf of its funds and segregated accounts to recognise the fiduciary responsibility it assumes in acting as an investment manager trinity street also recognises the need to exercise its proxy voting obligations with a view to enhancing our clients longterm investment values trinity street has a documented proxy voting policy in compliance with rule  of the investment advisers act of  principle  institutional investors should have a robust policy on managing conflicts of interest in relation to stewardship which should be publicly disclosed trinity street maintains a robust conflicts of interest policy to seek to identify and manage conflicts of interest that ensures our decisions are taken wholly in the interest of our clients in compliance with both the fca and sec rules trinity street takes a riskbased approach to identify areas of potential conflict of interest to manage and avoid conflicts of interest in an appropriate manner and to consider all conflicts when designing and implementing policies and procedures a copy of trinity street’s conflict of interest policy is available upon request from the chief compliance officer principle  institutional investors should monitor their investee companies comprehensive and continuous proprietary research and monitoring of investee companies is essential to and at the core of trinity street’s investment process trinity street utilises various research and support tools to meet this principle trinity street may from time to time choose to become insiders in such a case procedures are in place to restrict information and trading principle  institutional investors should establish clear guidelines on when and how they will escalate their stewardship trinity street takes an active approach to communicating its views to companies where it believes there are issues that will impact shareholder value trinity street prefers to build effective relationships with the management and boards of these companies in private discussions should this approach not be successful trinity street would consider in appropriate circumstances other strategies for example but not limited to expressing concerns through the company’s advisers or meeting with the chairman or other board members principle  institutional investors should be willing to act collectively with other investors where appropriate should occasion arise trinity street may find it preferable to work with other shareholders of an investee company to effect change before entering into collaborative engagement initiatives trinity street will take into account potential conflicts of interest and the regulatory implications of its actions principle  institutional investors should have a clear policy on voting and disclosure of voting activity as a registered investment adviser with the sec trinity street has a documented proxy voting policy in compliance with rule  of the investment advisers act of  trinity street’s clients can request a copy of the firm’s proxy voting policy from the chief compliance officer trinity street does not disclose this information to nonclients for a number of accounts managed by trinity street third party vendor electronic voting services are used such as broadridge proxy edge trinity street does not carry out stock lending on the accounts it manages principle  institutional investors should report periodically on their stewardship and voting activities due to underlying client confidentiality and investment or engagement strategy reasons it may not always be appropriate to disclose voting actions at a detailed level trinity street’s clients can request information about proxies voted and issues raised at meetings of investee companies trinity street does not disclose this information to nonclients general statements for further information on trinity street’s application of the code please contact our chief compliance officer steve hicks at stephenhickstrinitystreetamcom this statement of compliance with the code was last reviewed in march  and will be reviewed no less frequently than annually  march    pillar  disclosure trinity street asset management llp the “firm” is authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority the “fca” the firm is a uk domiciled discretionary investment manager to professional clients and both regulated and unregulated collective investment schemes the firm is a full scope bipru investment firm a full scope alternative investment fund manager aifm and is categorised as a collective portfolio management investment firm by the fca for capital purposes the firm reports on a solo basis the firm’s pillar  disclosure fulfils the firm’s obligation to disclose to market participants’ key pieces of information on a firm’s capital risk exposures and risk assessment processes  we are permitted to omit required disclosures if we believe that the information is immaterial such that omission would be likely to change or influence the decision of a reader relying on that information in addition we may omit required disclosures where we believe that the information is regarded as proprietary or confidential in our view proprietary information is that which if it were shared would undermine our competitive position information is considered to be confidential where there are obligations binding us to confidentiality with our customers suppliers and counterparties we have made no omissions on the grounds that it is immaterial proprietary or confidential risk management the firms management board determine its business strategy and the level of risk acceptable to the firm in conjunction with the risk officer they have designed and implemented a risk management framework that recognises the risks that the business faces and how those risks may be monitored and mitigated and assess on an ongoing basis the firm has in place controls and procedures necessary to manage those risks  the firm considers the following as key risks to its business operational risk – this risk covers a range of exposures including security breaches risk of clerical errors a breach of the fund’s investment objectives and the loss of key personnel operational risks and how they can be mitigated are assessed as part of the internal capital adequacy assessment process ”icaap” business risk – this risk includes a fall in assets under management due to market movements or internal factors such as poor investment decisions and a loss of reputation resulting in a reduction in fee income earned by the firm and hindering its ability to finance its operations and reimburse its expenses business risks are assessed and mitigated as part of the icaap market risk  the risk is the exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations due to investment management and performance fees being denominated in currencies other than sterling the firm operates currency bank accounts permitting it to receivepay currency directly credit risk – this risk relates to the exposure to the funds for nonpayment of management and performance fees and counterparty exposure relating to the firm’s bank balances and any other debtors this is monitored by the firm’s financial controller regulatory capital the firm is a limited liability partnership and its capital arrangements are established in its partnership deed its capital contains only members’ capital contributions the firm has a simple operational infrastructure its market risk is limited to foreign exchange risk on its accounts receivable in foreign currency and credit risk from management and performance fees receivable from the funds under its management  pillar  capital is the higher of  the base capital requirement of €     the sum of market and credit risk requirements and  the fixed overhead requirement  in addition the firm on account of its classification as a fullscope aifm is subject to a parallel own funds requirement as follows the higher of  the funds under management requirement subject to a minimum of € and  the own funds based on fixed overheads requirement   plus whichever is applicable of     a the professional negligence capital requirement or     b the pii capital requirement  pillar  capital is calculated by the firm as representing any additional capital to be maintained against any risks not adequately covered under the requirement in pillar  as part of its icaap when making this calculation the firm also takes into account the own funds requirement detailed above in particular where the own funds exceeds pillar  capital and the extent to which the firm is able to use capital instruments to fulfill both requirements   it is the firm’s experience that its pillar  capital requirement normally consists of the for although market and credit risks are reviewed monthly the firm applies a standardised approach to credit risk applying  to the firm riskweighted exposure amounts consisting mainly of investment management and performance fees due but not paid and bank balances having performed the icaap the firm has concluded that no additional capital is required in excess of its pillar  capital requirement as at the th september  the firm’s regulatory capital position was  capital item tier  capital £ total capital resources net of deductions £ the firm’s icaap assesses the adequacy of its internal capital to support current and future activities this process includes an assessment of the specific risks to the firm the internal controls in place to mitigate those risks and an assessment of whether additional capital mitigates those risks the firm also considers a wind down scenario to assess the capital required to cease regulated activities we have not identified credit risk exposure classes or the minimum capital requirements for market risk as we believe that they are immaterial concerning pillar  it is the firm’s experience that the fixed overhead requirement establishes its capital requirements and hence market and credit risks are considered not to be material furthermore the market and credit risks component excludes such risks related to the management of alternative investment funds our capital requirements are currently £ the higher of the minimum capital calculated in accordance with either ‘pillar ’ or ‘own funds’ which is well within the level of regulatory capital held we consider this amount to be sufficient regulatory capital to support the business and have not identified any areas that give rise to a requirement to hold additional riskbased capital the firm’s icaap is formally reviewed by the members annually but will be revised should there be any material changes to the firm’s business or risk profile    remuneration given the nature and small number of staff remuneration is set by the management board there is a formal review process of staff performance and based thereon determines each staff members overall level of remuneration and the split of that between base salary and bonus for employees and profit share for members in compliance with the fca rules on remuneration given that the firm has only one business area investment management all remuneration disclosed in our audited financial statements is from this business area the firm has defined “code staff” to be the portfolio managers risk officer and compliance officer the aggregate level of remuneration earned by “code staff” for the financial year ended st march  was approximately £ million as the firm currently has no alternative investment funds which is either domiciled in the european economic area eea or marketed in the eea there is no requirement for a remuneration statement to form part of the annual report of any alternative investment fund there is also a requirement for a remuneration statement to form part of the annual report of any alternative investment fund aif to which the firm acts as aifm and which is either domiciled in the european economic area eea or marketed in the eea   the firm is subject to the aifmd remuneration code the code has applied proportionality and pursuant to this application and where relevant has disapplied various provisions of the code    back to top copyright âš  trinity street asset management trinity street asset management     infotrinitystreetamcom toggle navigation home contact us compliance a
