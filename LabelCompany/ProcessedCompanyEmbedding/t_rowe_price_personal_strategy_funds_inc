lower the fund focuses primarily on income and secondarily on capital growth it offers the lowest riskreward ratio of the personal strategy funds the common stock portion of the portfolio has the potential to grow faster than inflation over the long term to help protect purchasing power while the bond portion can help cushion changes in stock prices the manager can rebalance the investment mix within defined ranges based on the economic outlook interest rates and financial markets investing equally in stocks and bonds the fund carries the same risks as its counterparts albeit to a lesser degree while moneymarket securities help provide stability this chart displays relative risk of each us mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart methodology we evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific riskreturn category on an annual basis a fund is generally placed in a riskreturn category based on the year standard deviation of its performance if a fund is less than  years old the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years for an asset allocation fund with less than  years of performance history substrategy returns are used when a substrategy is less than  years old the actual substrategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years risk return categories overlap a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories denoted by a plus  is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of t rowe price when a fund has a cashlike benchmark denoted by a double plus  its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns if the fund is less than  years old benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate all investments are subject to market risk including the possible loss of principal standard deviation of returns a measure of price volatility is one measure of risk please consult the funds prospectuses for a more
