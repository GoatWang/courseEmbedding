equity markets rose during the first half of  in fact annualized returns are on pace for the fifth best showing in  years the msci all country world index acwi generated a total return of  during the second quarter of  bringing its yeartodate return to  although the total return for the sp  index was below that of the acwi the sp still generated a healthy total return of  for the second quarter and  yeartodate the sp outperformed most global indices each of the past four years but relative economic conditions and policy positions have changed and it is not surprising the us has lagged most nonus markets in  despite this strong performance investor sentiment is less sanguine one potential reason is political uncertainty history has proven that when it comes to investing it pays to be apolitical tying investing to politics tends to be a losing proposition or at least a fleeting proposition we believe that equity markets generally align with economic fundamentals strong postelection returns of some stocks based on beneficial exposure to proposed us infrastructure spending andor tax reform has reversed during the first half of  in our opinion current equity market valuations are not dependent on new fiscal stimulus in fact we believe at this point in the cycle fiscal stimulus would be counterproductive and likely lead to further tightening of monetary policy which would in turn hurt economic growth and equity market multiples broadly speaking we continue to be in a low growth low inflation environment this is a positive backdrop for equity markets while the sheer length of the current us expansion now over eight years and the third longest in the postwar era is worrying to many expansions do not die of old age rather they usually end by some combination of federal reserve tightening and the unwinding of builtup imbalances during the most recent federal reserve meeting in midjune chairwoman yellen reaffirmed that the fed remains inclined toward more rate hikes this is our biggest concern we think the fed has just about exhausted its ability to raise rates without hurting the economy and equity markets as growth and inflation data continue to come in below expectations we think the current fed stance will soften and slow as it has done several times in recent years if we’re right it will support current or even slightly higher equity market multiples today’s economic imbalances are not as severe as those leading up to past recessions the ratio of household debttodisposable income is still close to postrecession lows corporate debttogdp is relatively high and somewhat concerning but cash flow growth seems adequate to cover the increase in debt and credit spreads remain extremely low if corporate profitability declines for any reason debt levels could become an issue we don’t think this is a risk in the near term but the end of the business cycle is likely closer in the us than other major economies given this backdrop we have added a new theme to portfolios to reflect this shift in global positioning   investment themes our themes capitalize on secular trends disruptive ideas innovations and economic forces that are reshaping the world thematic portfolios include growth and value stocks large and small capitalization stocks and companies with different geographic domiciles and global exposures each theme spans multiple sectors with macroeconomic conditions influencing sector factor and geographic weightings five major themes shape our portfolios molecular medicine will revolutionize healthcare breakthroughs in genomic science are changing the practice of medicine genomic sequencing technology clinical knowledge and data analytics are converging to deliver novel treatments and diagnostics that will improve medical outcomes and usher in a new era of healthcare the sequencing market was approximately  billion in  it is expected to grow to over  billion by  the cost of sequencing is declining rapidly ten years ago it cost almost  million to sequence one genome today it costs between  and  less than one million genomes have been sequenced to date by   of the population in the us will likely have their genome sequenced genetic information is increasingly being used to better treat many diseases including cancers genomic data is doubling every seven months after a hundred year migration to suburbia the us is urbanizing urbanization trends are occurring across the country influenced by demographics changes in city planning shifts in the housing market and new business models that leverage population density urban living has profound economic implications changing behavior spending and consumption patterns population growth in metro areas is now outpacing growth in nonmetro regions urban areas have significantly higher income levels and more money is spent on clothing education travel and food outside the home ondemand services such as uber grubhub and freshdirect are enabled by increasing population densities these services are leading to an even greater divide between spending and consumption patterns in urban and nonurban areas rentership versus home ownership is increasing in every age cohort expectations are for at least an additional  million renter households by  suburban and nearurban population centers increasingly include urbanstyle developments to accommodate walkable “downtowns” and other urban amenities   next generation automation is extending beyond the auto industry automation that was concentrated in automobile production in the developed world is now penetrating other industries such as retail food service and even healthcare this will lead to improved productivity dramatic shifts in supply chains and growing end markets for technology components and industrial equipment improvements in machine vision connectivity and programmingsoftware are enabling robotics to extend beyond the factory floor amazon now employs over  mobile robots in warehouses and fulfillment centers up from only  a few years ago amazon’s sales per square foot are over  versus approximately  for traditional retail stores we estimate that shipments of industrial robots will increase fivefold this decade pricing for optical sensors used in machine vision has fallen from over  per megapixel in  to less than  per megapixel today   intellectual capital data and user networks create new and sustainable moats traditionally hard to measure assets such as access to nonpublic consumer data intellectual capital including rd and proprietary technology and robust user networks have become increasingly valuable these properties provide competitive advantages and barriers to entry and have led to sustainably high returns for a select group of pioneering companies the value of intellectual capital has held up better than that of traditional assets in recent years companies in the topquintile of rd spendingtomarket capitalization have outperformed the market by  per annum since  and more than that this decade increases in brand value have a strong correlation to longterm outperformance the productivity gap between companies is widening between  and  the top  of firms within each industry generated productivity growth of  per annum the remaining  saw productivity growth of less than  in an increasing number of sectors it has been “winnertakeall” or “winnertakemost” with one or two companies attracting the top talent and garnering most market share in a particular industry   the us business cycle will end before others with unemployment below  and the potential for future interest rate increases it is likely that the us business cycle will end before business cycles in other developed markets run their course this may well end the multiyear stretch of us outperformance and impact sector leadership in the second half of  and beyond the us federal reserve has now raised rates four times current guidance is for at least one more increase in  another rate hike would bring the fed funds rate very close to or potentially above the neutral rate this would mean monetary policy would shift from accommodative to restrictive the fed has also indicated that it would begin to reduce its balance sheet by year end this would also be a form of tightening monetary policy conversely central banks in europe have much more room to maintain accommodative monetary policies given the significantly higher levels of unemployment and very low inflation european gdp growth outpaced us gdp growth last year and is on track to do so again in  the bank of japan is also likely to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future additionally japanese companies have been making important changes in corporate governance which should benefit shareholders   fixed income for most of the quarter performance in global fixed income markets seemed to indicate bond investors were pessimistic about prospects for global growth and inflation global bond yields fell steadily from midmarch through midjune before rebounding in the last two weeks of the quarter the us tenyear bond yield was  on march th it fell to a low of  on june th then rebounded to  to end the quarter similarly tenyear german bond yields yielded  in midmarch fell to  in midjune and then rebounded to  interestingly the low point in us bond yields coincided with the june federal reserve board meeting we suspect that some of the recent rebound in yields is due to more dovish commentary coming from fed governors paradoxically if the fed does not slow its rate increases we’d expect the increase in longterm yields to be short lived yields could fall to  or even a bit lower however if the fed pauses as we expect it is likely tenyear bond yields will trade between  and  as was the case for most of the first quarter overall our positioning has not changed we construct welldiversified highquality portfolios with shortintermediate durations the average duration of our bond holdings is approximately  to  years and the vast majority of our bonds are investment grade   subscribe to our quarterly investment update

investment update first quarter   during the first quarter of  the sp  index generated a total return of  almost all of the gain  occurred between early february and early march since the election the sp has returned slightly over  posted in investment update noteworthyduring the first quarter of  the sp  index generated a total return of  almost all of the gain  occurred between early february and early march since the election the sp has returned slightly over  while the prospect of marketfriendly policies has contributed we believe most of the move is underpinned by strength in economic data as it stands now we are in the second longest bull market since  it is logical to think about how and when it will end the challenge for bears is that there are few signs of speculative excess that normally accompany the start of a bear market further there is a real risk of exiting too early on average the final two years of a bull market have represented over  of the total return for the cycle over the last  years the smallest equity return in the final two years of a bull market was  with median returns of  while we are not expecting returns of this magnitude we think equities will outperform most other asset classes in    the economy and inflation we generally agree with fed chair janet yellen’s assessment of the economy during the most recent federal open market committee press conference in midmarch she said that “the simple message is the economy is doing well” indeed the moderate pace of growth that has prevailed since the beginning of the recovery means that the typical imbalances and pressure points that accumulate in the advanced stages of a business cycle are so far still absent inflation has remained low which has frustrated some but we believe is beneficial for financial markets inflationdriven growth often feels good in the short term paychecks rise and debt becomes easier to repay however over longer periods of time higher inflation tends to lead to tighter monetary policies and eventually recessions for people on a fixed income like retirees even moderate levels of inflation can be problematic as illustrated in this chart equity market priceearnings multiples begin to compress when inflation rises above                            from an investment perspective we are encouraged by the muted increase in us wage growth in march the fed revised its estimate of full employment to  from  this may seem minor but it suggests that policymakers believe the labor market has not yet tightened enough to push wage inflation higher we would not be surprised to see the federal open market committee continue to trim its forecast for the structural unemployment rate in the coming quarters we think it could fall as low as  before we see inflationary pressure this is critical because cycles typically peak when unemployment falls below nairu the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment we are not there yet investments although inflation can feel like a “quick fix” the only true way to raise standards of living and increase durable aggregate real wealth is through productivity growth productivity growth is difficult to engineer and almost impossible to engineer quickly it usually requires years of capital investment and technological breakthroughs as thematic investors we spend most of our time researching innovations that can influence productivity growth and impact the economy   the  genome – the first successful sequencing of the whole human genome concluded in  it took over a decade and cost approximately  billion in january  illumina announced a new genomic sequencer that will have the capacity to sequence an entire human genome in less than an hour for about  although the cost of genomic sequencing has been falling steadily and precipitously many oncologists and industry experts we talk to say it is this latest breakthrough that has the potential to spur far greater market penetration and to radically change the course of treatment for certain cancers today it can take days or even weeks for doctors to receive comprehensive sequencing results for a tumor in cases where cancer has metastasized this relatively short period of time can be too long to wait to start treatment the oncologist must prescribe medication andor procedures without a complete genomic analysis if the doctor could get statistically significant results in hours rather than days the calculus changes we expect a significant increase in the number of genetic tests and more important an improvement in cancer treatment as a result of this breakthrough thematic investment – chevy chase trust has invested in the global leader in dna sequencing technologies and the leading provider of comprehensive genomic testing the latter identifies the molecular alterations in a patient’s cancer and matches them with relevant targeted therapies immunotherapies and clinical trials we also invest in pharmaceutical companies with promising immuneoncology drugs currently on the market and in clinical trials because deciphering genetic information is extremely data intensive several of our technology holdings will be direct beneficiaries of these developments   just walk out shopping – anyone who has tried to “run into a store to pick up a few things” and ended up waiting in line too long will be pleased that very soon lines may disappear last december amazon opened an amazon go store there are no cashiers no lines and no waiting for the chip reader to chirp “please remove your card” walk in pick up what you need and walk out the purchases are posted to your amazon account as you leave the store amazon has not revealed the technical details behind the go stores a combination of artificial intelligence machine vision rfid radio frequency identification and sensor technologies make amazon’s “just walk out shopping” possible and importantly replicable amazon plans to expand go stores later this year productivity innovations often come with some adverse consequences currently cashiers are the second largest job category in the us thematic investment – chevy chase trust owns amazon in most client portfolios as the leader in this initiative it will clearly have a firstmover advantage however amazon is likely not the only or biggest beneficiary from this technological breakthrough with amazon’s annual revenue projected to be  billion this year it is unlikely that the go stores will be a large contributor to revenue or significantly influence the stock price however amazon’s effort may further erode market share from some already struggling traditional retailers avoiding companies in the bullseye of creative disruption is a core element of thematic investing on the other hand enablers of the technology will benefit we currently own the global leader in machine vision systems as well as a leading manufacturer of scanning systems both will likely see sales rise as competitors upgrade or fully replace their own check out systems to try to compete   the us as an energy exporter – one of the least discussed but extremely consequential goals of the new administration is to accelerate the transformation of the us into an energy exporter the administration is on track to restart several dozen energy projects that were either canceled or mothballed by legislation and regulation during the prior administration if the us meets this goal it will be a political achievement that will be further enabled by technology technological advances in oil extraction have led to a huge increase in productivity shifting the global cost curve downward in the permian basin for example oil productionperrig increased by  in the last few years lowering the breakeven points for us shale operators this progress has led to a boost in production while supporting profitability in a lowerprice environment the economic and geopolitical consequences of reducing us dependency on foreign oil and potentially even becoming an energy exporter could be game changing thematic investment – chevy chase trust is market weight the energy sector as a whole and underweight oil counterintuitively increased investment in a sector more often than not leads to lower future returns although technological breakthroughs lower breakeven costs for producers in this situation we think they will also lead to more competition we favor investment in companies that are among the lowest cost producers and have superior geological assets these companies will likely fare best in this more competitive environment relatively low energy prices also support our longerterm benign inflation outlook and should provide a boost to our favored consumerrelated holdings as money previously spent on energy will be redirected elsewhere   portfolio positioning in the latter half of  we increased our nonus holdings particularly in developed markets such as europe and japan we expect to continue to increase our nonus equity exposure as we find companies domiciled abroad that benefit from our themes global economic growth has been accelerating in most geographies around the world in fact europe’s gdp growth rate was faster than the us’s last year and economic performance in the region continued to be relatively strong in the first quarter of  after several years of underperformance many nonus equity markets have outperformed the sp yeartodate we expect this to continue due in part to lower valuations and more room for margin expansion       fixed income after spiking higher late last year longterm yields traded in a relatively narrow range during the first quarter of  the year treasury bond began the year at a yield of  and ended the first quarter only five basis points lower at  with a high for the quarter of  and a low of  similar to equity investors bond investors will be attuned to inflation expectations if inflation rises sooner and higher not our current expectation yields across the curve would rise at an accelerating pace and bond prices would decline if inflation remains subdued mid and longterm bond yields may increase slightly but not significantly as expected at its most recent meeting the fed increased the fed funds rate by  basis points to a range of   this is only the third rate hike in  months a historically slow pace both the written and verbal commentary suggest that the fed remains committed to a very gradual rate of increase in fact chairwoman yellen used the word “gradual” or ”gradually”  times during her press conference since the meeting some fed governors have indicated that they anticipate three or four more  basis point rate increases this year even this pace feels slightly aggressive to us unless we see a significant pickup in economic growth andor inflation we think there may be fewer rate hikes a slower rate of increases is bullish for both equity and fixed income investors subscribe to our

quarter    was a good year for equity markets posted in investment update noteworthy was a good year for equity markets the sp  generated a total return just shy of  and the msci allcountry world index excluding the us returned  while the us presidential election and brexit dominated headlines the broad economic recovery was the most important financial development of the year the current equity bull market began in march  it has been called the most unloved bull market in history still fresh memories of the financial crisis have led to an almost pathological assumption that good times can’t and won’t last in fact since the start of the recovery there have been net redemptions from domestic equity mutual funds and etfs every year except  unlike  when a rise in bond yields was relatively short lived the current rise in yield appears more sustainable this could spur a rotation back to equities from bonds providing a catalyst for yet another leg up in the current bull run the most recent surveys of institutional investors show that the majority of participants believe us equity markets are overpriced this is understandable given that the market capitalization of the sp  has increased by almost  trillion just since the election while we would not be surprised by a fourth consecutive weak january led by investors who deferred selling stocks with embedded gains important nearterm indicators including healthy market breadth narrow credit spreads and accelerating earnings growth point to continued strength the bull market is very likely closer to its end than its beginning but it may not be over yet alan greenspan first used the phrase “irrational exuberance” in  that market had three more years to go and more than doubled before it ended in  signals versus noise recently many traditional economic relationships have broken down sharp parallel rises in both currency and yields are rare usually when the us dollar appreciatesrapidly longterm interest rates do not since dollar strength slows economic growth emerging markets usually do well when commodity prices rise since many emerging market economies are commodity dependent however since the election the msci emerging market index has declined  while the goldman sachs commodity index has risen almost  in an environment of strengthening global growth cyclical currencies usually strengthen against the us dollar the opposite is occurring given these paradoxes the metric we are watching most closely is inflation a relatively low and stable level of inflation is a sign of a healthy economy equity market multiples tend to be at their highest when inflation is between  and  the federal reserve board believes that an inflation rate of  is ideally conducive to its mandate of price stability and maximum employment over time a higher inflation rate would hamper the public’s ability to make accurate longerterm economic and financial decisions on the other hand a lower inflation rate would increase the probability of deflation broadly speaking the past  years have been characterized by increasing globalization which is inherently deflationary in a globalized world more competition and access to cheaper labor reduces the costs of goods further if a country experiences an idiosyncratic shock that raises domestic demand the demand can be met with more imports rather than higher prices many of the factors that facilitated globalization over the past  years were oneoff developments china cannot join the wto more than once tariffs in most developed countries cannot fall much further because they are already close to zero there is nothing on the horizon that will match the breakthrough productivity gains in global shipping that stemmed from containerization and the global supply chain is already highly efficient we believe the deflationary pressures that were the hallmark of the postbretton woods era are behind us and we are entering a reflationary period where the risks of deflation have receded but widespread inflation is not yet imminent this is generally good for risk assets in the shortterm particularly cyclical equities portfolio positioning with global economic growth improving higher inflation still suppressed and real yields negative in europe and japan stocks remain attractive relative to bonds the majority of our equity holdings are beneficiaries of trends that we believe are powerful enough to influence corporate performance  most of our investment themes are secular rather than cyclical driven by technological or demographic forces that persist independent of economic cycles and thus have the potential to outperform across different market environments on occasion at economic turning points like we believe we are witnessing now cyclical forces can have an outsized influence on equity market performance currently two of our six themes are motivated primarily by cyclical changes impacting financials and energy the macroeconomic transition from a deflationary to a reflationary environment will put upward pressure on interest rates concurrently the financial regulations implemented postcrisis have been absorbed and will likely ease under a new administration both of these changes will benefit banks the financial sector is the only major sp sector still trading below its  high we believe a pickup in lending activity due to accelerating global growth rising interest rates wider net interest spreads and financial deregulation will be tailwinds to large us banks in  another sector that we believe will disproportionately benefit from faster global growth is energy it is often said the cure for high oil prices is high oil prices and the cure for low oil prices is low oil prices at  per barrel most oil companies could not profitably drill for oil so they stopped and supply fell because demand growth was also tepid in the first half of the year the drop in supply did not result in an increase in price  as economic growth accelerated in the second half of the year demand rose and the price of oil began to climb  simultaneously opec reemerged with some unity and production discipline ridesharing services like uber have and will continue to increase automobile usage and gas consumption likely at the expense of public transportation this creates additional oil demand in the short run these factors should combine to produce tailwinds for some energy companies in  genomics remains one of our highest conviction secular themes the broader healthcare sector underperformed the market in  after five straight years of strong performance we still believe advances in molecular medicine will dramatically improve the ability to identify and combat disease and will benefit innovative companies facilitating this life sciences revolution the pipeline of oncology drugs has never been greater a november th article in the washington post titled “how a researcher used big data to beat her own ovarian cancer” provides a real life case study of how a combination of dna sequencing new therapies and big data analytics another chevy chase trust theme can dramatically change the impact of cancer from a geographic perspective we are increasing our holdings in developed market nonus equities in particular japan in the third quarter of  japan corporate profits reached a record high yet foreign fund flows into japanese equities were still negative for the full year  japan is a prime example of how an aging population will eventually push up interest rates the household savings rate in japan was over  in the early s since then the percentage of the population that has moved from working age to retirement age has more than doubled from  to  the savings rate today is only  meanwhile the ratio of job openingstoapplicants is at a year high this will eventually lead to higher wages and end persistent deflation japan will benefit from this shift because inflation will pressure real rates as opposed to nominal rates lead to a weaker yen a stronger stock market and even higher inflation expectations  we are looking at investment opportunities in japan particularly ones tied to our global themes from a longer term perspective there are reasons to be concerned in the us rising interest rates coupled with a stronger us dollar will be a drag on us economic growth  additionally when inflation is on a firm upward trajectory central banks everywhere may find it difficult to slow the trend these two factors will then weigh on equity market multiples and a strong us dollar puts pressure on emerging markets as of mid dollar denominated debt held outside the us had risen to almost  trillion dollars about onethird of the debt is held in emerging markets as the dollar rises against other currencies the cost of servicing debt increases nonetheless barring an exogenous shock these risks are real but probably not pressing enough to change nearterm equity market momentum it may be a bumpy ride but we believe there is still upside entering  fixed income  was a wild year in the bond market year bond yields started the year at  and fell to a low of  shortly after brexit prior to the us election yields climbed back to  and after the election shot up another  basis points to a  high of  before settling back to end the year at  although the absolute numbers may seem small in percentage terms these are large moves pundits debate whether the year bull market in bonds is finally over we do think the cyclelow for bond yields is behind us and yields will continue to climb from current levels just not linearly but we don’t expect another doubling in yields until spare capacity outside the us is absorbed only when other central banks start raising rates will the federal reserve be able to sustain its rate hikes until then any fed tightening beyond what is already expected will put upward pressure on the us dollar thereby reducing the need for further hikes given this outlook we are maintaining our current portfolio positioning the average duration of our bond holdings is approximately  years as bonds reach maturity or we identify swap opportunities we will seek to reinvest the proceeds in higher yielding instruments continued volatility in the bond market will present opportunities to buy high quality securities at discount prices  we will

shareholders and to create sustainable business models money managers have made compromises unfortunately the biggest casualty is the individual portfolio—not to mention the individual investor today most investors are presented with stylized commoditized options that promise to “manage risk” and to deliver predictable performance this is especially true in equity investing because in reaction to growing client rosters and everincreasing quotas money managers have been forced to create efficiencies and along the way the idea of diversification has been distorted the premise diversification across small medium and largecap styles and managers will serve as a buffer against market fluctuations the problem risk isn’t a number it’s a concept by attempting to minimize risk money management frequently creates overdiversification—and misses sound opportunities true diversification comes from investing in the best opportunities with real potential for sustained growth investing across

sort through your options is difficult you trust your financial advisor with your money so it is important to make the best possible decisionhow to choose a financial advisorwhen you start your search for a financial advisor you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs that means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start lookinghere are some common needs from financial advisors cash flow management budgeting retirement planning investing paying for childrens education no financial advisor is perfect for every need which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyonehow to find a financial advisoryour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors you will want someone who is easy to reach and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if neededthere are over  registered financial advisors in the united states smartassets financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs answer questions about where you live your plans for retirement and other financial priorities in just a few minutes youll be all set and smartasset will have an advisor contact youquestions to ask a financial advisoronce you have found a few advisors you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisorhow many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money it is best to find someone with plenty of experience advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the stormwhat is your strongest focus area in financial planning some advisors are experts in retirement others have expertise in estates and trusts others still are best suited to help you pay for your childs education some financial advisors focus on people who are selfemployed be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need not what someone else needswhat is your budgeting philosophy every familys budget is unique budgets can be very detailed or more general some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals others take a more balanced approach find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yourshow are you compensated some financial advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjectivedo you like the person do you trust them would you trust them with your daughters education fund your retirementif you have been able to limit your list down to your final few it is time to trust your gut it is important to have an advisor you like trust and enjoy interacting with your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you dont trust pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey if you do youll be on track for a great financial futureif youre ready to start answer a few questions in smartassets financial advisor selection tool

financial advisor your details done by eric rosenberg january   choosing a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line  picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research to find the perfect advisorchoosing a financial advisor is an important decision it requires the best information available gathering information about financial advisors can be tough that is why smartasset created a financial advisor match tool answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from it doesnt matter if you
