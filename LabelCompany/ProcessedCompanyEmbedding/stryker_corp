surgical devices orthopaedics — hip knee ankle and trauma implants — accounted for  percent of stryker’s sales in  the most of any of the three sectors the company held  percent of the hipreplacement market in the us and  percent of kneeimplant market making it the third largest player in each in may  stryker announced it would begin issuing payments to about  people injured by two models of its hip implants as part of a  billion court settlement the company agreed to in late  starting at  per failed implant the individual payments may be higher depending on the number and types of complications patients suffered stryker from bed builder to diverse medical technology company in  dr homer stryker rented space in kalamazoo michigan’s borgess hospital to set up an orthopedics practice he used a basement room to work on ideas for medical tools one of his first inventions was something he called a “turning frame” it was a hospital bed that allowed doctors to reposition patients as needed while keeping the patient immobilized the bed was popular with doctors and hospitals that started placing orders and stryker hired his first employee to manufacture it in  in  stryker incorporated his business as the orthopedic frame company featuring just four products the turning frame a walking heel for casts a surgical traction device and a cast cutter removing casts remained a difficult and time consuming process in  dr stryker hit on an idea for an oscillating saw using the motor from a malted milk mixer the device could quickly slice through hard casts but its blade did not cut skin it was the beginning of stryker’s move into medical technology devices stryker’s oscillating saw stryker’s oscillating saw to remove hard casts was his beginning move into medical technology devices in  the orthopedic frame company recorded its first year of more than  million in sales the company had  employees and about  percent of its products were the result of dr stryker’s own inventiveness in  the company changed its name to stryker corporation and dr stryker finally retired from his medical practice devoting full attention to being chairman the next  years saw major growth as stryker began expansion into international markets started acquiring other companies and issued an initial public offering ipo on the nasdaq dr stryker died in  the company he started in a basement nearly  years earlier reached  million in sales and established the forerunners to its current divisions that same year in the decades after its founder’s death stryker would focus on international expansion developing new technology and acquiring other companies innovation and acquisitions make stryker a global medical device leader in the s stryker acquired synoptics allowing an entry into endoscopy markets rolled out the first cordless heavyduty power tools for orthopedics and marketed the first liquidproof surgical video camera and the first chip medical video camera providing higher quality resolution than previous surgical cameras in  stryker’s annual sales hit  million in the s the company expanded into canada latin america japan china and hong kong and continued opening new offices in europe in  stryker acquired swiss company osteo allowing stryker to enter the orthopedic trauma market one of the company’s most important turning points came in  when stryker acquired pfizer’s howmedica division for  billion — the largest business transaction in stryker’s history the purchase of pfizer’s howmedica division nearly doubled stryker’s size and sent the company’s annual sales ballooning to  billion a year overnight stryker became one of the biggest players in the global medical technology industry in  stryker made the fortune  for the first time with  billion in annual sales during the early s the company continued expansion to new countries across europe and entry into other fields such as pain intervention surgical navigation and surgical waste management it also created lines of hip and knee replacement implants specifically designed for the japanese market between  and  stryker closed more than  acquisitions of other companies or divisions it spent more than  billion dollars to acquire two more companies in  annual sales topped the  billion mark for the first time when the company posted  billion in sales for  stryker hip implants have been subject to recalls and lawsuits amid all its growth and innovation some of stryker’s products have led to expensive recalls and court settlements in  stryker recalled more than  of its rejuvenate and agb ii modular hip stems after people implanted with the devices developed medical complications some components in the devices were made of a proprietary chromiumcobalt crco alloy one of the symptoms people had were elevated levels of the two metals’ ions in their body stryker modular hip components the problems were connected to stress and corrosion where the implant components came in contact with one another this caused the release of minute amounts of the metals which studies linked to bone and tissue destruction stryker advised people with the devices to consult with their doctors even if they weren’t experiencing symptoms more than  lawsuits over the devices were combined in a multidistrict litigation mdl in a minnesota federal court in  mdls allow similar lawsuits to move more quickly and efficiently through the legal system in  the company agreed to a  billion settlement with plaintiffs individual compensation started with a  base payment with larger amounts for people who suffered additional complications or multiple surgeries in  stryker recalled another crco alloy hip component for a problem called “trunnionosis” this was a condition in which small particles of the metals were released around a component called the trunnion the erosion could damage bone and tissue and could even cause the device to fail when the components became “disassociated” from each other more than  components called lfit anatomic cobaltchromium v femoral heads lfit v were recalled in april  six federal lawsuits over the lfit v were combined in an mdl in a massachusetts federal court at least  other lawsuits filed at the time were expected to potentially join the mdl in may  the new jersey supreme court ordered all state lawsuits there consolidated into a multicounty litigation mcl at least  lawsuits had been filed in new jersey by march  stryker cooperates with federal investigations into company subsidiaries in september  stryker was the only one of america’s five largest orthopedic implant manufacturers who escaped paying into a multimillion settlement with the federal government over allegations of kickbacks to doctors for using their products and costs being passed onto medicare and medicaid zimmer inc depuy orthopaedics inc biomet inc and smith  nephew inc all paid a portion of the  million settlement stryker quickly cooperated with the us department of justice doj investigation led by then us attorney chris christie while the company was not required to pay into the settlement stryker agreed to the same nonprosecution agreement npa as the other firms the npa required all five companies which controlled  percent of the orthopedic implant market at the time to implement reforms and agree to federal monitoring for  months two months later in november  stryker agreed to pay  million to the federal government to settle a doj investigation into a former subsidiary physiotherapy associates stryker had sold the outpatient physicaltherapy business to chicago privateequity firm water street healthcare partners for  million in june  “under the terms of the sale agreement stryker will retain responsibility for certain cash damages to be paid in connection with the previously announced investigation of physiotherapy associates’ billing and coding practices by the united states department of justice” stryker said in a statement at the time “the company will continue to fully cooperate with the department of justice until this matter is ultimately resolved” stryker corporate headquarters the settlement resolved the federal government’s claims that physiotherapy falsely billed medicare medicaid and the defense departments tricare health care programs for services in  stryker subsidiary otismed and its former ceo pleaded guilty in federal court to intentionally distributing kneereplacement related devices that had not been approved by the fda otismed paid more than  million in fines criminal forfeitures and interest to the federal government former ceo charlie chi was sentenced to two years in prison for his role the illegal distribution happened before stryker acquired otismed in november  and stryker cooperated with the doj investigation but under terms of the conviction the otismed subsidiary was banned from participating in medicare medicaid tricare and other federal health programs for  years stryker also agreed with federal prosecutors to comply with doj measures at the new acquisition to prevent future misconduct there robotics d printing featured in stryker’s future stryker’s future remains largely focused on innovation a reflection of its founder’s own inventiveness stryker spent  million on rd in  and has spent  percent or more of its revenue on research and development each year since  its acquisitions have also focused on bringing in new technology developed by others some of stryker’s most forwardlooking innovations involve robotics and d printing in  stryker acquired orthopedic surgery robot maker mako surgical for  billion the devices are designed to make surgery more precise for doctors and less painful for recovering patients the mako system is used for planning kneereplacement surgery prior to the operation and assisting during surgery the system creates a d model of how the knee implant will fit doctors are able to plan the procedure before ever entering the operating room and adjust the fit of the implant to the patient the system also assists the surgeon in precisely removing bone to implant the replacement knee stryker reported installing  of the robots in the third quarter of  alone accounting for what the company called “ percent yearoveryear growth” in mako system sales in  stryker introduced its mako roboticarm assisted total knee system the new robotic system combined mako technology with stryker’s triathlon implant system for total knee replacement since receiving fda approval in  two of the components in the triathlon tritanium knee system have been d printed styker’s new knee replacements stryker is combining robotics and d printing to create and implant knee replacements in  the us food and drug administration fda granted k approval for stryker’s tritanium pl posterior lumbar cage the spinal implant is manufactured with the company’s tritanium ingrowth technology which uses d printing to create implants that mimic the porous nature of bones this allows the implant to function in much the same way as natural bone as bone tissue grows around it stryker has developed a proprietary d printing process called amagine — the “am” stands for “additive manufacturing” the industry’s name for d printing working from a computer model of the part a laser melts and creates layers of titanium powder welding layeruponlayer as it builds the finished component the customized implants can be based on a patient’s individual anatomy and needs in  the company was building a new “center for excellence” in cork ireland that would include a d printing and manufacturing facility in may  stryker’s senior director for platform technology said the company was considering working with hospital chains to develop small d printers that could quickly produce custom implants on site speaking at a convention and trade show for the aerospace defense and medical device industries gene kulesha said the innovation could be less than a decade away he outlined the idea of small d printers each with its own team of “print engineers” the engineers would gather data on a patient’s unique requirements design custom implants and deliver them for surgery within six hours author terry turner terry turner is an emmywinning former television journalist turned senior writer at drugwatch in more than  years of reporting he has seen countless examples of how people armed with comprehensive quality information have the power to make better decisions for their lives and holding those who harm them accountable

big pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers the fda and the public to increase sales the public is exposed to pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising for example critics say abbvie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as androgel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men they created a marketing campaign around the condition “low t” that featured a quiz for men to selfdiagnose low t symptoms androgel above was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up the testosterone market soared into the billions as a result but few studies back up drugcompany claims that the drug significantly enhances mood vitality and sexual performance studies also link these drugs to heart problems the fda added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to big pharma doctors conduct research with funds from big pharma private charities and foundations account for a mere  percent of the estimated  billion spent on biomedical research in the us each year pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately  percent big pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout the trade group phrma has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena including  who worked for a member of congress  who worked for a federal agency  who worked for a congressional committee two who worked for the white house one who worked in the court system using these connections to pursue industry goals big pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest marketing research and development rd and drug cost americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases thousands of dollars more per prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed journal of the american medical association jama actively vie for the attention of big pharma advertising dollars billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug according to propublica’s dollars for docs investigation  companies paid  billion to doctors and hospitals from august  to december  drug and device company payments to doctors from select companies august  to december  company payments depuy johnson  johnson  million stryker corporation  million astrazeneca  million pfizer  million janssen pharmaceuticals  million glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesbig pharma fraud settlements in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud according to public citizen’s  report pharmaceutical industry settlements  through  fact in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud the most common charge involved drugpricing scams against state medicaid programs this meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while big pharma made billions unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements but these investigations take many years to complete by then drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion while the us department of justice fine is typically only a few million this makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies according to michael bobelian of forbes magazine manufacturer

president medical spencer s stiles president instruments brian j white president sustainability solutions number of employees  global headquarters kalamazoo mich mergers and acquisitions are a large part of the oem environment in today’s medical device space companies are seeking strategic targets to purchase as a rapid method with which to enhance their international footprint improve product offerings in specific device sectors or supplement rd with the procurement of a startup company that’s developing a cuttingedge technology it’s become a pervasive element in the strategy of most medtech oems stryker however may have been one of the more active in  perhaps not in overall dollar figure but in terms of the number of transactions they were likely near the top of the list and looking at the company’s revenues for the  fiscal year it seems to be a profitable success overall stryker invested more than  billion into ma activities in fiscal  its two larger purchases were sage products and physiocontrol international in addition it bought the safewire product portfolio synergetics usa’s neuro portfolio stanmore implants worldwide ivy sports medicine and bd’s vertebral compression fracture portfolio on feb  stryker announced it was purchasing sage products from madison dearborn partners at a price tag of  billion the firm produces disposable products intended to reduce “never events” within the intensive care unit and medsurg hospital unit setting the company’s products address issues such as hospitalacquired infections hais skin injuries and healthcare worker injury sales of these products in  totaled  million which was an increase of  percent over the prior year undoubtedly with the shift to valuebased care and the efforts toward reducing the instances of such events particularly hais stryker views the company as a growth opportunity “the company’s established leadership team and innovative products that help prevent hospitalacquired conditions have driven consistent doubledigit sales growth” kevin a lobo chairman and ceo of stryker stated in a release first announcing the transaction “this acquisition aligns with stryker’s focus on offering products and services that support a mindset of prevention specifically in the area of ‘never events’ such as hospitalacquired infections today through our medical division stryker offers products that are complementary to those produced by sage sage has a year history of focus on patients and caregivers that is evident in their culture and fits well with our medical division this business will also provide a consistent disposable revenue stream that will complement our capital equipment offerings we look forward to welcoming the sage team to stryker” the deal formally closed only a couple months later on april   four days later stryker noted the completion of its other significant deal in fiscal —the acquisition of physiocontrol international inc this transaction—valued at  billion—was first announced on feb   the firm was sold to stryker by bain capital private equity in an allcash transaction physiocontrol offers more of a emergency medicine type of product line to stryker with monitorsdefibrillators automated external defibrillators and cprassist devices making up the bulk of the company’s offerings it also offers data management and support services sales in  totaled  million in  which was an increase over the prior year by  percent another valuable aspect of physiocontrol was its established presence and infrastructure internationally “physiocontrol has achieved global leadership positions with a strong brand and customercentered solutions that can predict or intervene in lifethreatening emergencies” lobo stated in a release first announcing the transaction  “physiocontrol’s focused strategy and their culture will fit well within the ems business of our medical division further leveraging our existing call pattern we look forward to welcoming the physiocontrol team to stryker” analyst insights despite solid performance in recent years strykers biggest challenge will be to successfully sell outside north america the company sees approximately  percent of revenues from the us and canada while these markets now represent under  percent of the total market —tony freeman president as freeman advisors llc while these two were the larger transactions for stryker in  the other deals the oem made were still significant starting in february it was announced that the neuro portfolio of synergetics usa was to shift to stryker in an allcash deal this portfolio is comprised of products including the malis generator spetzler malis disposable forceps and stryker’s existing sonopet tips and rf generator sales of approximately  million were attributed to the portfolio in  “the acquisition of the synergetics neuro portfolio is highly complementary to stryker instruments’ neuro spine  ent nse business and is aligned with nse’s strategy of expanding its neurosurgical product offering” timothy j scannell group president of medsurg and neurotechnology stated at the time of the announcement shortly after the synergetics deal was completed april   stryker had another ma announcement on april  the oem declared that it was purchasing the safewire product portfolio which had been composed of the ywire guidewire and the tiger jamshidi needle family for use in minimally invasive spine surgery the products were purchased to enhance stryker’s spine product portfolio and its focus on minimally invasive spine surgery offerings in a release issued announcing the acquisition brad paddock president of stryker’s spine division said the introduction of the safewire portfolio reflects stryker’s ongoing commitment to patient safety and providing surgeons with innovative technology needed to treat patients undergoing minimally invasive spine surgery “this acquisition increases our competitive advantage as we broaden our product line and extend our customer base among teaching facilities competitive accounts and existing safewire customers” another april acquisition was the purchase of bd’s vertebral augmentation solutions business which included the avamax avatex and avaprep brands these minimally invasive products are used in vertebroplasty and vertebral augmentation procedures they originally came out of the bd acquisition of carefusion similar to several aforementioned transactions this purchase was accomplished with the intent of bolstering stryker’s preexisting product line in the space “the acquisition of bd’s vcf portfolio is highly complementary to stryker instruments’ interventional spine ivs business and is aligned with ivs’s strategy of expanding its vcf footprint” scannell stated at the time of the deal announcement “it also further strengthens stryker’s brand in the neurotechnology space” the purchase of stanmore implants worldwide limited from siw holdings limited for a purchase price of £ million rounded out stryker’s april buying spree stanmore offers custom and offtheshelf solutions that address the needs of surgeons treating adult and juvenile orthopedic oncology although quiet through the summer months stryker kicked off september with its final ma declaration in fiscal  with the announcement of the acquisition of ivy sports medicine llc ivy sports medicine’s product offering was centered around the minimally invasive repair of the meniscus the portfolio included the only fdaapproved collagen meniscus implant cmi and an insideout meniscal suturing platform “the acquisition of ivy sports medicine strengthens our capabilities and fits strategically with our current portfolio ivy’s complete meniscal platform coupled with their clinical history will allow us to provide our customers with multiple solutions to address meniscal repair” matt moreau vice president and general manager of stryker’s sports medicine business said at the time of the announcement “this is an area of sports medicine where there is continued opportunity to address unmet customer needs the ivy portfolio provides a unique platform for us to build upon as we seek to continue advancing the treatment of meniscal injuries” analyst insights never a shy company watch for stryker to continue its aggressive growth through both acquisition and its international expansion efforts stryker is a dangerous competitor as it wakes up “unafraid” to challenge itself each and every day —dave sheppard cofounder and principal medworld advisors undoubtedly as a result of the completion of several of these transactions within fiscal  coupled with the success of acquisitions made in earlier years as well as organic sales growth of stryker’s legacy and newly released products the oem enjoyed a significant boost in sales in  for the first time in its history the company bypassed both the  billion and  billion sales marks to finish the year at  billion an increase of  percent over the prior year compared to  billion in  and  billion in  possibly a concern for future growth or a great opportunity depending upon how it’s viewed the company’s sales in fiscal  were primarily driven by the united states which accounted for  percent of total revenue across the board the company’s three main segments—orthopaedics medsurg and neurotechnology and spine—will need to better penetrate international markets to enjoy even greater growth in the years to come the orthopaedics segment is primarily focused on implants for knee and hip joint replacements as well as trauma and extremity surgeries notable within the segment is the company’s mako total knee application which joined the company’s other mako offerings in the robotic armassisted reconstructive surgery line after it received fda clearance in  the company celebrated the full launch of the total knee in march  looking at the segment’s full offering sales break down fairly evenly among several divisions knees were responsible for  billion in sales followed by trauma and extremities at  billion hips came in at  billion with “other” accounting for  million totaling  billion for the entire segment this represented an increase of  percent over  medsurg which bypassed orthopaedics in  in terms of percentage of overall contribution to the company’s sales figure for the first time in several years  percent for medsurg versus  percent for orthopaedics was bolstered by several of the aforementioned acquisitions the end result was a substantial  percent increase in sales over  the product offerings from this segment include surgical equipment and navigation systems instruments endoscopic and communications systems endoscopy patient handling emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products medical and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices sustainability similar to the orthopaedics segment the sales are spread almost evenly across the divisions totaling  billion in sales medical led the segment’s sales with more than  billion followed by instruments at just under  billion endoscopy was close behind with  billion and at a distant fourth for the segment was sustainability at  million neurotechnology and spine the name also reflects the only two divisions within the segment contributed  percent to the company’s total sales the neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques a line of products for traditional brain and open skullbased surgical procedures orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products and minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke the spine products include cervical thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury deformity and degenerative therapies sales translated to a  percent split with neuro contributing almost  billion to sales while spine was at  million in total the segment’s  billion in sales reflected a  percent increase over the prior year outside of the product and company acquisitions stryker reported organic growth of approximately  percent over  while much of that was from already established products the company provided some of the growth may have originated from several of the new offerings announced in fiscal  in march the oem formally introduced two new products at the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons annual meeting—the aeroc cervical stability system and the xia  cortical trajectory implants and instruments the company claims the spine division’s aeroc is the only straightforward acdf device that offers uniform compression across the interbody space the technology received fda k clearance in december  also out of the spine division the xia products are used in less invasive lite lif posterior lumbar interbody fusion procedures for patients with degenerative disc disease spondylolisthesis and trauma according to the company it is also intended to be more muscle sparing than standard open procedures that require lateral dissection keeping busy with product launches the spine division also debuted a dprinted
