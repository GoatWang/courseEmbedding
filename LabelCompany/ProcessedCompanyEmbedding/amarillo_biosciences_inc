administered interferon   the company’s technology was quite unique in that the existing product on the market was injectable interferon which for some time has been fdaapproved to treat some neoplastic viral and autoimmune diseases  however many patients experience moderate to severe side effects causing them to discontinue the injectable interferon therapy as stated earlier abi’s core technology is a natural human interferon alpha that is delivered into the oral cavity as a lozenge in low nanogram doses the lozenge dissolves in the mouth where the interferon binds to surface mucosal cells in the mouth and throat resulting in stimulation of immune mechanisms  orally delivered interferon has been shown to activate hundreds of immune system genes in the peripheral

before year end  abi has full rights to exploit this patent in the us africa india thailand malaysia australia new zealand indonesia the philippines and certain other smaller markets “approval of this patent signifies a very important milestone for abi and for medicine” said dr stephen t chen chairman and ceo of the company “low dose oral interferon has been proven to be extremely safe for human therapies  furthermore our lowdose oral interferon has shown very positive results in various clinical trials issuance of this patent will expedite the development and commercialization of the new treatment and usher the product into global markets” thrombocytopenia is a blood system disorder in which there is a reduction in the thrombocyte platelet count caused by suppression of bone marrow the bloodproducing organs  the use of highdose injectable interferon chemotherapies nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids penicillin antibiotics and other strong harsh medicines used in the treatment of diseases and chronic conditions cause such an effect on the bone marrow and platelets  platelets play the key role in the formation of blood clots which prevent and stop hemorrhage uncontrolled bleeding from a ruptured or injured blood vessel thrombocytopenia increases the risk of spontaneous bleeding which could become fatal if it occurs in the head intracranial areas or from the lining of the stomach or somewhere else in the gastrointestinal system approval of this patent signifies a very important milestone for abi and for medicine low dose oral interferon has been proven to be extremely safe for human therapies furthermore our lowdose oral interferon has shown very positive results in various clinical trials issuance of this patent will expedite the development

will prove to be a safe and affordable treatment for people with severe or lifethreatening thrombocytopenia  current treatments are effective but expensive and come with serious side effects and surgical risks  such treatments include immunoglobulin therapy ivig given through a vein plasma exchange plasmapheresis platelet transfusions and corticosteroid medicine the scientific proof for this patent came out of a clinical trial conducted in taiwan between  and  this trial was designed to use low dose oral interferon to help prevent viral recurrence in hepatitis c patients who have received the combination conventional therapy – highdose injectable interferonα and ribavirin as a result of receiving this therapy numerous patients suffered thrombocytopenia  surprisingly platelet counts of one treatment group in which patients received iu of low dose oral interferon daily quickly recovered back to the normal range within  weeks and the patients experienced almost no adverse side effects
