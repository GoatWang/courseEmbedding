europe just as in the us  was the year that institutional investment in hedge funds began to take off after three years of dismal returns in their traditional bond and stock portfolios british dutch scandinavian and swiss pension funds and insurance companies turned their attention to alternative investments whose value as noncorrelated holdings they craved even as equity markets worldwide

increased interest in alphaoriented investing swelled the coffers of the fastgrowing group of hedge fund managers based in europe where asset growth is outstripping that of the hedge fund market as a whole according to analysts much of that money is run by the very biggest managers the europe hedge fund  alphas ranking of the biggest families of singlemanager hedge funds based in europe which is published for the first time in this issue shows that the  top managers run  billion in assets or about half of the total assets of  billion to  billion that industry analysts estimate europes hedge fund managers held at yearend  leading our list of europes biggest hedge fund groups is londonbased man investments which ran  billion in its ahl managedfutures program as of september   man is followed by multistrategy firm glg partners also in london with  billion and barclays global investors which offers equity marketneutral and other hedge funds around the world and managed  billion

of small offices in the smarter parts of london and most of the members of the europe hedge fund  are in london with a few in paris one in switzerland and one operating out of sweden they look like veteran investment managers rather than upstart boutiques and they sport extensive staff to develop trading models manage risk and handle back office chores there is a growing belief that larger hedge fund managers should have an infrastructure commensurate with their size and we can show a huge infrastructure  we can tick those boxes says mark chambers man investments head of sales management for europe this is attractive for people allocating  million  there are not many managers that can take that capacity man benefited from s markets which aided systematic trend followers the firms ahl

currency markets asks mark fitzgerald director of the alternative investment group at bgi europe he points out that  percent of the foreign exchange markets participants  such as central banks trying to support a currency or corporations hedging exposures  are not trading for profit that creates inefficiencies for fund managers such as bgi to exploit in our list we provide each managers total
