rating lowest most helpful oldest review rating excellent  good  ok  bad  terrible  showhide filters sunergy private message cms do anything to deny warranty claims  out of  reviewed on oct   purchased a cms solar pump at my cost to display at country shows hoping to build a business stream in solar pumping at the very first show it worked for  hours then stopped due to the controller blowing up further investigation found that the supplied solar panels had no blocking diodes therefore every time someone walked in front of the solar array it caused ripple currents which then blew up the controller we tested both the controller and the pump and found it was the controller which was faulty not the pump contacted cms read more who wanted to know exact details of display installation then focused on the pump installation and found every possible reason why it had not been installed in accordance with the very detailed installation instructions they were not interested in the fact it was the controller they found one obscure clause in the install instructions to deny a warranty claim as above it worked for  hours before blowing up when pushed they then said that shadows caused by people walking in front of the array was abnormal and therefore not a warranty issue according to cms cows will never walk in front of a solar array a tree will never cast a shadow today i had a call from someone in townsville  same issue ripple currents blowing up his controller exact same response from cms  doing everything they can to deny him his warranty rights do not buy cms solar pumps unless you want a poorly designed shoddy product that lasts  hours and then a million excuses about why there is no warranty claim you get what you pay for  there is a reason they are
