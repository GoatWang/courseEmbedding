nutrition expert randy roach talks about everything from his past and present to the current state of bodybuilding learn more and see how he is presently adjusting to life without eyesight in  randy roach caught his first real glimpse of the kind of life he would pursue for the next years a newsstand publication featuring arnold schwarzenegger sergio oliva and dave draper so grabbed randys imagination he made it his mission to learn all he could about this fascinating emerging sport of bodybuilding although sufficiently motivated and enthused about his decision to become a weight trainer randy became increasingly disillusioned with the paucity of genuine nutritional and training information available to beginners like himself what does paucity mean smallness of number fewness scarcity during the s there was good weight training information out there however it just didnt seem to surface as readily as the weider publications says randy this led many young aspiring bodybuilders to spend many years wallowing in training and nutritional ignorance when you are in your teenage years you read everything with the notion that all is true if it is in print they just wouldnt lie to us would they well yes they would and they did and they still do it took randy until his early s after much trial and error to discover exactly what worked best for him at this time randy made his best gains in muscle he is still improving today ever the experimentalist randy during his quest for knowledge uncovered many bodybuilding truths he decided to become a personal trainer to help others cut through the mysticism he encountered randy says of this process not all was wasted those years of reading and trialanderror turned into an accumulation of experience and a degree in been there done it that could be shared with others in the hope of sparing them the same paths that many of us had taken after reading and trying as many training and dietary practices as i had you are bound to stumble onto the truth at some point randy eventually graduated to building exercise equipment while developing a reputation as someone who gets the best from his clients however his real interest lies in nutrition a subject he is intensely passionate about at  randy considers himself to be in the best shape of his life in the following interview randy shares many of the strategies he has used to get both himself and others in to tremendous shape his ideas may shock some but his success rate is hard to argue with  q  hi randy could you give the readers some background on yourself how did you get started in weight training a ill be  this august th and was born and raised in waterloo ontario canada i spent most of my career as a computer programmer developing software for various markets as for weight training i remember seeing dave draper way back in the late s when i was just a kid he appeared in the beverly hillbillies and the monkees he also had those ads where he had his arms stretched out to the sides showing the veins it looked great click image to enlarge randy at age  my younger brother tom used to have his own variation of drapers poses where hed strike a classic shot then throw out his belly he was only a little kid and it looked hilarious i still laugh when i think of that you had to see it he had it mastered i was one of those guys who bit in immediately loved every aspect of the sport i was building benches at the age of  there are a number of guys in the industry who are into bodybuilding equipment martial arts and boxing i was and still am one of those guys my eyesight pulled me out of the boxing and martial arts back in my teens and basically filtered me strictly into weight training this was fine with me that is where i wanted to be i would have thrived in this industry no matter what era i was born  q  you mention being involved in weight training and its associated practices for over three decades what have you learned over this time regarding what works and what does not a as i mentioned i was building benches at  i continued building all sorts of things from that point damn near killed some friends while i was at it i am serious when i say i have been in it that long even though i was only a young teenager when i got started i was beginning the trial and error process very early youd think that i would have gathered knowledge quickly the truth is that i was probably in my early s before my head popped up from south of the belt line i learned that genetics play a significant role but they are not everything much can be attained with persistence tenacity and good eating i never inherited my dads solid structure my brother did but he never took it past his draper poses i never gave up i worked hard and made many mistakes but i learned from them the iron game has splintered into so many factions that it confuses many people the industry is so divided because of that i guess it does serve the commerce and has provided some pretty good entertainment over the years but the polarity has hurt us as well you can build strength and muscle many ways as my friend jim bryan says even if you screw up hell you should still build some level of muscle if you cant man youd best get yourself a trainer or another pastime  q  what interests you most about the iron game a id have to say the nutrition most of all followed by the sports history and the actual training i used to like building equipment some of my stuff did actually turn out with a low mortality rate ive been fortunate to meet tyler hobson of pendulum strength training solutions he has quite a mind in this regard  q  what are some of your current projects a my main focus right now is on my book muscle smoke  mirrors  q  what kind of impact will your new book have on those who read it will any new facts be revealed can you share some of these a i think it will have a tremendous impact the book will be like no other in the game at least not that i am aware of it began as an article request from the weston a price foundation about four years ago the article was published in  as splendid specimens it was substantially edited down they actually did a good job considering the amount of data i gave them the article was fine for the general public but so much of the context was removed that i felt the bodybuilders may find it lacking i was surprised when i found out how many were reading it and liked it click image to enlarge my book will have a tremendous impact the book is so much more the project has been totally rewritten from the first draft from which the article came it is not an illustrated piece there are already many out there in that style mine is going to be approaching  pages based primarily on a narrative format the byline of the book is bodybuildings amazing nutritional legacy the book title was originally the history of nutrition in bodybuilding dr kaayla daniels who wrote the whole soy story feels i have a much bigger audience than i think and offered to write the back cover if i changed my boring title so thats when i came up with muscle smoke  mirrors the title truly reflects the nature of the industry  q  when did you decide to make the project a book a originally i had no intentions of writing a book ron kosloff of nsp nutrition asked way back if i was at least going to put it into a small pamphlet form and send it out a couple of friends also hinted at perhaps doing something but it was when interviewing dr mauro di pasquale almost three years ago that he right out of the blue said this is going to be a great book i said no mauro its an article for the price foundation he just replied its going to be a book he agreed to write the foreword about a month or two later he felt our industry needed this type of work he has not seen it before mauros a great guy and open minded hes going through some of the chapters now preparing for the foreword i was a bit concerned that he was an md and i cover much of the history of the philosophical divide between orthodox and alternative medicine you cannot look at the history of nutrition in bodybuilding without going into the roots of bodybuilding itself that means going back through weightlifting into the origins of physical culture those early pioneers in most part practiced a holistic lifestyle emphasizing all aspects of health the ones that werent in the beer halls in most part allied themselves with the alternative field of healing bernarr macfadden led the way on this man did he ever piss off the medical trust as he called them back then bernarr macfadden bernarr macfadden b august   d october   was an influential exponent of physical culture a combination of bodybuilding with nutritional and health theories he founded physical culture magazine in  and later parlayed it into a publishing empire including true story true romances the oncefamiliar movie magazine photoplay and a trashy tabloid newspaper the new york evening graphic at the peak of his career he owned several hotels and a major building in new york he made an unsuccessful attempt to found a religion cosmotarianism based on physical culture he claimed that his regimen would enable him to reach the age of  i write on this philosophical division and the philanthropic intervention that seized control early in the century and set us on course for the health mess we are in today there was a lot of activity going on back then and our industry had many players and gurus who had their roles in shaping the game sandow hackenschmidt strongfort calvert jowett berry hoffman weider lurie rader blair gironda the list goes on lots of influence from outside in the field of nutrition research the food industry not to mention the politics within the iron game itself and the battles for control tons of stuff and tying it all together was very interesting as i stated earlier i dont think anyone has looked at the sport from this view before i basically deal with all aspects of the industry bodybuilding itself had quite a struggle for its own identity then it had to break free from the shadows of weight lifting the arrival of supplements was a financial saving grace that changed the game from a commercial perspective for sure and the drugs well from physical culture to what we have today the final fall i feel the book will resonate powerfully both in and out of the industry mauro would like to get it into four to six languages as soon as possible  q  how hard was it getting people to contribute a it was tough at first since i was basically a nobody or no name in the business jim bryan was already a friend and we talked for hours he ended up opening a few doors my biggest break was when bill pearl took me seriously and gave his time and name to use when trying to land others slowly more came on board after two years of lingering and pestering others i guess began to realize i was really trying to produce something worth while and became quite generous with their time after four years i have made some good friends  q  on a different note randy as a personal trainer you are known as someone who gets excellent results what in your view does a good personal trainer need to do to ensure a high success rate a if it is simply a good success rate you are after then the best thing to do is train only elite athletes or slightly overweight mesomorphs you really cant go wrong those guys and gals respond to anything actually as crass as that may sound the approach does have to be applied at a more subtle level every trainer encounters the individual who you can sense within minutes is going to be a challenge and in some cases you know they will not make it the psyche just isnt there having positively charged motivated clients plays a big role in whether you are successful you find after a while that your enthusiasm becomes relative to that of your client if a client is constantly negative you have to make sure they dont see the drain they are putting on you click image to enlarge randy is known for excellent results your job is to try and turn that attitude around sometimes you can often its so entrenched its hard you have to determine how much energy you can afford if there is constant negativity then you are going to have unbalanced energy dynamics between the two of you too many clients of that nature per day will drain you you really have to have been in the business for a long time and understand the nature of exercise and health just knowing anatomy physiology and kinesiology is not enough you must know how to apply them in terms of achieving a real harmony or good health it truly is an individual endeavor for each person different applications for the vast individuality out there a clients age mental and physical constitution biomechanics lifestyle desires willingness and personal histories all have to be looked at today its not simply a matter of trainers not knowing what they are doing but more so not understanding what they are doing its not a matter of simply achieving a certain level of body fat or resting heart rate that doesnt always reflect good health or success there has to be a harmony health is harmony on all fronts training for athletics is different especially at the pro levels its no longer about health just winning as i said those guys are relatively easy to train the challenge is in the lower echelons of the genetic pool that is where you are confronted with all the anomalies physical and mental with all that i still feel that nutrition is the priority you can exercise until the cows come home but if you are eating trash or simply wrong for your body youre dead on the other hand history clearly shows that those eating superior diets without any type of th century fitness intervention had great health and longevity for general good health and wellbeing i go with the gironda line of  to  nutrition and the remainder exercise however for bodybuilding i go with about  to  nutrition especially if you are not genetically gifted for the sport  q  what has enabled you to become a top trainer a usually top trainers are associated with training pro athletes or celebrities for which i have none but as i noted above i wouldnt mind at times since it would be easy the pros are so gifted and the celebrities are extremely motivated my energy is primarily focused on my book and some of my own training experiments right now so i dont carry a big training load the clients i have are good they dont drain me we have a good exchange of energy and many make me laugh in fact some are quite gifted and motivated themselves i have a good understanding of what fitness truly is my experience in nutrition is fairly extensive due in most part to learning from my many mistakes i also have a decent grasp of anatomy physiology and biomechanics as they apply to exercise when dealing with the general public its a matter of cultivating a healthy lifestyle it begins with what you are putting in your mouth i state again nutrition is always first exercise alone will not do it in fact exercise could actually be detrimental if you are already in constant ill health and are not willing to change your diet which is usually the cause then adding the stress of further exercise will simply accelerate the degenerative process if the diet could not sustain good health before how could it possibly do so with more physical demand the challenge with most non athletes is getting them to change their lifestyle many love their social interaction and often that incorporates alcohol and junk food you usually end up with compromise on both ends they must end up with something that they can live with and wont stress them out and again its an individual thing when there is a total dietary alteration the turnaround can be extremely dramatic  q  your own physical development is pretty impressive describe the training and nutrition programs you use to get into top shape a my slogan is when it comes to exercise and nutrition i have basically done it all wrong at least twice that usually instills great confidence in my clients we can learn from the old timers as well they really did know how to build strength and muscle  without drugs right now i am experimenting with cycling intensities and volume i like cycling things on a weekly basis ive been doing that with my diet for about  years click image to enlarge without drugs even though i am primarily a raw food eater di pasquale and i basically see nutrition in a similar light mauro eats a fair amount of raw food also i like his phaseshift approach i find that the raw food has made a big difference in my shape and health i wish i had hooked into it decades ago i did the vegan thing but it was the meat i needed so badly the raw beef chicken liver and heart has agreed with me tremendously  q  the raw meat will probably make many a little squeamish especially the chicken do you feel raw meat is superior what about salmonella poisoning associated with this practice how do you reconcile this a the raw meat makes everyone edgy as it did me several years back when dr ron schmid introduced me to it i remember sitting down to eat raw beef for the first time the meat was ground and mixed with eggs and cream it was brutal i thought there is no way we were meant to eat like this even if we were i didnt know how long i could tolerate it i was going to just drop it but i got frustrated with myself for giving up so fast the next day i tried it again without the cream and eggs i just added a bit of sea salt huge difference still sucked but i didnt gag this time but i remember thinking that if i could adapt that much in one day then we can probably eat anything related poll have you ever eaten raw meat yes it tastes a lot better raw yes and i wont be doing that again no way disgusting no but ill try anything once since then i have come up with some recipes that make it quite tasty i have also acquired a taste for it its kind of like beer who ever loved their first taste of beer not many ill only have my meat raw from now on unless im eating at a family gathering oh yes my brother has started eating raw meat also he could be making a comeback we have all been indoctrinated with pasteurs theory of germs being the cause of disease he wasnt the only voice back in the th century  just the most politically connected others like bechamp and bernard opposed him vehemently i cover some aspect of this debate in the book since many of the alternative practitioners sided against pasteur i was just as paranoid as everyone else over the germ thing it took me another year before i would eat the chicken i finally gave in and realized i liked the taste of it raw better than cooked what happened after was kind of funny but boosted my confidence in the notion that pasteur was probably wrong because of my eyesight i would often leave chicken lying on the counter after cutting it up louis pasteur scientist pasteur is the thcentury biologist and chemist whose work with germs and microorganisms opened up whole new fields of scientific inquiry aided industries ranging from wine to silk and made him one of the worlds most celebrated scientists in  pasteur became a professor of chemistry at the university of lille and soon began studying fermentation in wine and beer he became convinced that as he put it in an  paper the germs of microscopic organisms abound in the surface of all objects in the air and in water he determined that such microorganisms could be killed by heating liquid to  degrees celsius about  degrees fahrenheit or higher for short periods of time this simple process became known as pasteurization a process used today in milk and many other beverages id eat some wash my hands then walk away not seeing that i left some on the counter i was doing this quite often and throwing it out getting quite pissed finally one day i just said the hell with it im eating it what is our immune system for anyway the chicken had sat out for about  hours and was actually starting to get crusty i ate it all and had zero ill effects in fact ive not been sick once in the years that ive eaten raw i have also eaten threemonthold moldy berries and while were at it ive done my urine too there now you have it all the raw food health practitioners actually age meat for months to create all sorts of bacteria for various forms of disease fighting including very aggressive cancers its called high meat the eskimo also would ferment meat raw is superior it breaks down quite easily with far less stress on the digestive system it comes with its own enzymes taken with raw honey it is even better the raw food researchers claim that the protein is far more available than when cooked its common sense you cook you alter you kill many attack or brush this off because the thought of eating raw disgusts them i was once there myself i cant believe how far i have come in attitude change its just such a major difference in how i feel physically it takes some time for the body to slowly rebuild you should hear armand tanny when you talk to him about his raw meat you can almost hear him salivating over the phone armand said he didnt need any steroids with all the raw protein and creatine he was getting he was quite big and hard in  and  when he won the usa and pro america gironda too ate tons of raw eggs cream and meat periodically they knew what worked one of my five chapters on the s is called muscle cows and chickens this was my favorite decade it was classic bodybuilding yeah they had drugs but not all were abusing them and many werent taking drugs at all these guys definitely knew the proper application of the cow and chicken they were tuned into muscle building howorth draper scott mackey gajda balik green peters and many more our industry had a lot of good solid voices during the th century while the rest of the general public was being duped unfortunately many of the bodybuilders not all though were also misled when north america went astray during the s and s fitness boom  q  can you elaborate a we were basically led down the cardio and low fat bullsht trail i cover the history and rise of the lipid hypothesis in my book that is the notion that cholesterol and saturated fat caused heart disease and almost everything else man that nonsense did and still is doing a lot of damage made some industries piles of money though many strength performance researchers believe that we really lost it to the eastern bloc countries when we went on the running and cardio craze back in the late s again it was driven by people who didnt understand what good health really is many of the conclusions reached on both the nutrition and exercise fronts are being reversed or seriously revisited too much emphasis on exercising the heart believing it is the secret to longevity i get everything i want for myself in terms of health and harmony through diet and weights im on the spin bike twice a week for five minutes of sprints the rest is all weights right now i am striving for more muscle so im doing some interesting things that would probably invoke criticism from some of the bodybuilding factions  q  would you care to expand on that a no not right now im still trying things out as i said earlier the old timers knew how to build muscle you cant spend the number of hours on this history as i have and not come away with a few things i cover more than just the nutritional legacy of the sport but also the philosophical splits in training with all the factions there was a lot of confusion and some of the magazines made it worse arthur jones arrival and mike mentzer later on again just added to the confusion i really dont discuss my training to much outside my circle at my gym fred fornicola from new jersey is one of the few who keeps tabs on what i am doing hes a hit guy with an open mind makes me think sometimes more than i care to he and matt brzycki just put out a book dumbell training for strength and fitness  q  you lost your sight last year how did this happen and what impact has it had on your writing and training a actually ive had eye issues going back to  when i had steven johnson syndrome sjs at the age of two the troubles escalated in my s but i still remained functional i had experienced short periods of blindness here and there over the years but just over a year ago i began staring at a white wall the training wasnt a big deal other than the massive beatings i was taking in the gym from running into things i finally started using my white cane this wasnt a big shock to me i was expecting this to happen but i thought it would be another  years i prepared early by building my customized home with a world class gym in the basement i have about  square feet of training space fortunately i worked for a great company that helped me transition out of computer programming into what i am doing right now ymca canada has also been very supportive in coming to my place for the recertification process they were a little concerned as to how i could monitor motion and progress as a blind guy i found that i am probably a better trainer using hands on than i was before i just have to be careful i have already grabbed one guys ss my family and friends have been great my mom is a real trooper and still does quite a bit for me as did my dad before he passed away a few years ago he was a great welder as for the book that was a challenge it was very frustrating initially lots of foul language and tossing a few things my good friend and editor george harrod really stepped up to the plate for me george is not a bodybuilder he is more of an historian who has taken a keen interest in this project in fact i think he is into it almost as much as i am he and another good friend moira dunn have read for hours to me its kind of strange when you come into my place you just see this blind guy surrounded by books and magazines from all through the th century i dont know what the mail woman thinks when she delivers all these books and mags from bob adams and i cant even see to sign for them let alone read them another good friend tamas acs of acs fitness has also helped me tremendously with the online searching and things of that nature i am currently trying to upgrade my voice software scanner and scanning programs to bring in much more material im moving along  q  you have researched heavily the impact certain diets have on certain populations is there a perfect diet what are some guidelines we should all follow a a diet that gives one a long diseasefree life of happiness i guess could be considered a perfect diet you can have a great looking physique but without harmony there is no happiness without happiness there will be eventual collapse on either or both the physical and mental fronts these breakdowns begin when the diet is not sound yes i have looked and tried so many things over the years including vegan vegetarianism the macro nutrient balance can vary from person to person i personally do much better on low carbs the bottom line is that we eat too much sht there is no better word to use because that is what we are eating weve lost the understanding of the power and vitality contained in fresh natural and raw foods diet has been relegated to such a low priority keep the grocery bill down so we can buy other useless items our food supply is being trashed through mass industrialization we let it happen for all the wrong reasons weston prices landmark work nutrition and physical degeneration says it all just in his title alone neither drug nor natural competitive bodybuilding are synonymous with good health the drug regimens are insane but the naturals are almost as bad in some cases the diet and supplementation regimens they are using are not even close to being natural i remember back in the s reading some of the supplement regimens when pro hormones were still legal it was such a rap sheet i thought man why not just do a round of dianabol and get it over with its cheaper it works and is probably safer dont get me wrong i take a few supplements myself and have good friends in the supplement industry but they know how to use them properly along with a decent diet in fact the honest ones will tell you themselves that supplements are not of much value if your diet sucks many of the naturals are living off totally processed diets even if they buy the bulk of their stuff out of a nutrition depot the vitality is gone its a slow degenerative process some are stronger and more resilient than others and the drug guys theyre downing cake mix to work with their insulin shots if only a percentage of the movie super size me is true then its a total indictment of our healthgoverning bodies that they should allow a nutritionally abysmal environment to flourish is a testimony of their total ineptness how did this happen was it plain stupid or corrupt or both take your pick either way billions have been made because of this direction every bad decision regarding our food supply always seems to have resulted in a coincidental enormous cash flow for some aspect of industry click on your favorite restaurant to learn the truth â â â â â â â â â  q  who in bodybuilding do you admire and why a well you have to admire guys like jack la lane and armand tanny they are going strong at  and  respectively i believe im kind of partial to tanny since he is a raw meat eater there are a lot of guys whom i admire what they do even if its not my thing i admire anyone who is still plugging away in the industry in an honest way and believes in what they do i have all sorts of friends representing all facets i speak often with jim bryan who was close to arthur jones way back fred fornicola who runs the online high performance newsletter and tyler hobson of pendulum who may even be better than arthur jones with strength curve technology ron kosloff of nsp nutrition who is a huge gironda supporter related article my reflections on vince gironda the man the master after two years of frustrating and fruitless bodybuilding i was contemplating quitting the sport then i was introduced to vince learn more as i reflect  click here to learn more  don howorth has a story that should be told bob gajda and terry strand in chicagoland have been great supporters gajda is hilarious to talk with and the guy is still sharp and thinking at  even good old dan lurie i told him i thought he was dead i respect all these guys and several more i probably forgot to mention  q  what do you think of the physiques of today compared with those  years ago a pretty well the same as everyone else  not much i have nothing against the guys just dont like their physiques their look and how they attained it represents a gross departure from any essence that bodybuilding or physical culture ever possessed theres even an enormous change from as late as  look at the  mr o and then anything after youll see exactly when the gh igf and insulin erupted almost no one likes this look even the homosexual audience is dwindling i hear now that alone should be a flag everyone liked the aesthetics and individuality of the older days its amazing how they just threw stuff like symmetry right out the window  q  what are your views on drug use in bodybuilding should it continue to ensure the freakier physiques continue to populate the stage or would a return to a more realistic look be better a well ill continue from the previous question top pro bodybuilding isnt really bodybuilding anymore its something else call it what you want its dying avenues necessary to attain such a look are outrageous and most wont go there those who do are real chemical pioneers as far as what the body can withstand in fact genetics may not even be the dominant factor anymore its more like who is the bravest who is the best chemist and who can sculpt with synthol most effectively i hear the magazine sales are falling attendance is dropping off and the sport is losing young talent because of the reduced number of teenagers entering the amateur ranks as wayne demilia told me who would want their kid in the sport at this stage anyway there will always be a small faction who just like to do the crazy thing or get the crazy look but the sport is better than this contrary to what many think there are a lot of good people in the industry the sport is always hungry for money and media attention it will follow the money and attention we just need people to take it in a new direction and we may be at that time demilia is giving it his best shot with pro division inc which was just announced recently no one can say he cant run a bodybuilding show but we can certainly say that ami and the ifbb sure as hell cant that last mr o was terribly produced i piped it in with some friends i couldnt believe what i was hearing and they couldnt believe what they were seeing i have spoken for several hours with demilia i dont know him personally but he strikes me as a man who truly wants to reel the sport back to a reasonable path he has the experience and more loyalty than most people realize he should be supported i like his plan he will operate in a professional manner the ifbb has failed professional bodybuilding they have had their run talk about smoke and mirrors even sealtest dan the muscle man is donning his cape and making a comeback the old bugger is going to be  i believe and still wants to have some fun thats dan lurie for any of your readers who are younger

bodybuilding guild also never count out dan lurie hes a winner next time you talk with him ask what happened to all his muscles youll love his response anyway people are just fed up with what they are
