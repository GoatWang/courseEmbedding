since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search better buy enterprise products partners lp vs buckeye partners lp when deciding between two highyielding midstream companies with impressive distribution increase histories most investors should err on the side of safety reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer apr   at am midstream giant enterprise products partners lp nyseepd has increased its distribution for  consecutive years and yields roughly  relatively tiny buckeye partners lp nysebpl has increased its payout for  years running and has a  yield since both oil and gas midstream players offer impressive yields and solid increase histories which is the better choice in this case the lower yield might be the better choice for most investors big and diversified the thing about enterprise is that its huge in fact with a market cap of nearly  billion its one of the largest energy companies in the united states and easily one of the largest midstream names thats both good and bad for example with a market cap that large it takes big projects to move the needle on the top and bottom lines to put a number on that enterprise is working on roughly  billion worth of projects over the next year or two   image source enterprise products partners lp slow and steady growth is the most likely outcome here so if youre looking for a swiftly rising distribution youll need to look elsewhere but with scale comes diversity for example enterprise owns pipelines terminals processing facilities and even ships that gives it a broad base to support continued distribution increases and allows it to put money to work where it sees the most opportunity small focused more risk buckeye partners meanwhile is a much smaller partnership with a market cap of just under  billion its hard not to notice that buckeyes distribution yield is higher than enterprises and that it has an even better record of annual increases in fact theres a lot to like about buckeye notably including the partnerships successful efforts to diversify the business in  roughly  of buckeyes adjusted ebitda came from domestic pipelines and storage facilities after spending around  billion on acquisitions and internal growth between  and  that number is down to  with the partnerships global terminals business going from nothing to around  of adjusted ebitda meanwhile adjusted ebitda has steadily risen every year clearly there are things to like here   buckeye has been changing its business for the better image source buckeye partners lp buckeyes business is centered around marine terminals and storage facilities thats not a bad thing but it does make buckeye a far more focused operation than enterprise if the terminals business starts to falter buckeye doesnt have any other levers to pull to keep its overall business humming along its a bigpicture risk but one conservative investors should think about very carefully id ask this question is the extra yield worth the chance of sleepless nights should buckeyes terminals business come under pressure to put that into perspective buckeyes distribution coverage fell below  in  and  meaning distributable cash flow wasnt enough to pay its distribution there were legitimate concerns that buckeye would be forced to cut or at least hold off on further increases clearly it kept chugging along but it was a tough time to stick by management today buckeyes coverage ratio is a healthier  times but thats still not as high as enterprises  times   is it worth it as you look at enterprise and buckeye you really need to think about the bigger picture buckeye is a wellrun partnership with a strong history behind it but it is very focused on the terminals and storage business thats been a distribution coverage problem in the past and it could easily be a problem again in the future for most investors particularly those with a conservative bent the extra risk that brings into the picture probably isnt worth it larger and more diversified enterprise meanwhile can easily shift gears and put money to work where it sees the best opportunities because of its size growth in the business and the distribution are likely to be slow but slow and steady isnt such a bad thing when you start with a roughly  yield even though i think buckeye partners is a wellrun partnership the vast majority of investors would be better off owning enterprise reuben brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends enterprise products partners the motley fool has a

management deems not indicative of core operating performance results and business outlook adjusted ebitda is derived as follows table  figures in  millions except per unit amounts and  change source

q vs q reflects an increase in the number of units outstanding coupled with the absence of any ebitda contribution with respect to the  equity interest in vtti in q this equity interest contributed  million to adjusted ebitda the depreciation figure added by management in deriving adjusted ebitda includes  of the depreciation and amortization expense for buckeye texas although bpls ownership

million and  million q and q respectively for q bpl includes for the first time its share of vttis adjusted ebitda  million the nongaap adjustment made by management in deriving adjusted ebitda totals

applies this nongaap adjustment to vtti but not to other equity method investments for these bpl records just its equity in undistributed earnings or losses reduced by distributions received management justifies the inconsistency based on the size of the vtti investment adjusted ebitda by segment is presented in table  table  figures in  millions except per unit amounts and  change source company q k k filings and author estimates adjusted ebitda at the pipelines and terminals segment in q increased  vs q the increase was driven by a  increase in pipeline throughput a  increase in terminal throughput and a  increase in average pipeline tariffs improved performance at the global marine terminals segment in q over q primarily reflects the contribution for the first time from the acquisition of the  interest in vtti the segment reported lower processing revenue at buckeye texas lower ancillary revenues principally due to lower berthing activity and higher operating expenses capacity utilization rates remained very high overall adjusted ebitda in the ttm ended  totaled  million up  on an absolute basis and up  on a per unit basis vs the comparable prior year period to derive distributable cash flow dcf bpl deducts from adjusted ebitda cash interest payments maintenance capital expenditures and other items eg taxes table  shows dcf distributions and reported coverage ratios table  figures in  millions except per unit amounts and  change source company q k k filings and author estimates table  shows that dcf per unit has been increasing at a faster pace than distributions per unit in  of the past  quarters but that has not been the case in the two most recent quarters it will be important to see whether dcf growth in q outpaces distribution growth dcf is one of the primary measures typically used by a midstream energy master limited partnership mlp to evaluate its operating results because there is no standard definition of dcf each mlp can derive this metric as it sees fit and because the definitions used vary considerably it is exceedingly difficult to compare across entities using this metric additionally because the dcf definitions are usually complex and because some of the items they typically include are nonsustainable it is important albeit quite difficult to qualitatively assess dcf numbers reported by mlps reported dcf may differ from sustainable dcf for a variety of reasons these are reviewed in an article titled estimating sustainable dcfwhy and how applying the method described there to bpls results generates the following comparison between reported and sustainable dcf table  figures in  millions source company q k k filings and author estimates for q bpl includes for the first time its share of vttis dcf  million based on the nongaap adjustment previously described with respect to ebitda the actual amount of cash that will flow to bpl from vtti may differ from managements calculation in q vtti declared a dividend of  million to bpl i used that amount rather than the  million in deriving sustainable dcf other variances between reported and sustainable dcf result in part from differing treatments of working capital cash flows dcf numbers reported by bpl ignores all such cash flows while my sustainable dcf calculation deducts cash used for working capital because cash consumed is not available to be distributed however despite the apparent contradiction in the methodology i ignore cash generated by liquidating working capital because i do not consider it a sustainable source over reasonably lengthy measurement periods working capital is typically not a huge consumer of funds for mlps variances between reported and sustainable dcf also result from risk management activities these reflect fluctuations in the value of derivatives used to hedge exposure to commodity prices and interest rates on a quartertoquarter basis bpls results can be significantly impacted by these fluctuations on a ttm basis the impact is typically more muted some of the gains and losses related to these cash flows are not reflected in bpls statement of operations rather they increase or reduce total equity through the statement of comprehensive income i do not take these into account when calculating sustainable dcf further variances between reported and sustainable dcf result from a variety of items grouped under other these include noncash compensation expenses amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts hurricanerelated expenses acquisitionrelated expenses and other items bpls business is seasonal the second and third calendar quarters typically generate lower coverage ratios stronger performance is typical of the first and fourth calendar quarters due to the seasonal rebound in heating oil margins and butane blending opportunities it therefore makes sense to focus more on ttm coverage ratios because the seasonal fluctuations are neutralized table  figures in  millions except coverage ratios source company q k k filings and author estimates coverage ratios based on reported dcf improved markedly in the latest quarter and ttm period coverage based on sustainable dcf in that period also improved but remained under x the simplified cash flow statement in table  shows bpl has been funding a portion albeit small of its distributions by issuing debt and limited partnership units this table  figures in  millions source company q k k filings and author estimates table  shows bpl used debt and equity to fund  million of its distributions in the ttm ended  i would reduce that shortfall by the  million dividend to be received from vtti but that still leaves a shortfall even though reported dcf was greater than x this apparent contradiction is due to reported dcf being boosted by including proceeds from liquidating working capital as shown in table  absent that coverage for the period would be below x as shown by the sustainable dcf ratio distributions have been increasing at the modest rate of  per quarter since q in the conference call discussing q results management indicated distributions increases will continue at the same pace in the near term we expect to maintain our quarterly distribution growth rate at  per limited partner unit throughout the remainder of  it also indicated that disclosures regarding vtti would be limited to bpls share of adjusted ebitda bpls share of dcf and the dividend to bpl declared by vtti i think this reduces the quality of the nongaap numbers provided by management and makes bpl more difficult to evaluate management expects investments in organic growth capital projects to total between  million and  in  cash flows from new projects commencing operations and vtti should bring down the leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda from its x level as of  and bring a modest improvement in coverage ratios however management did sound a note of caution regarding lower operating income from the global marine terminals segment that segment had benefited from exceptionally high utilization levels and favorable service rates and management noted that while utilization remains high through the first quarter of  we expect changing market conditions and evolving structural flows to have some effect on both utilization and rates as we progress through the balance of year we anticipate slightly lower utilization starting in the second quarter partly as a result of being unable to reach an acceptable commercial agreement with a longterm customer bpl earnings call
