howard marks subscribe to receive an email notification when a new memo is posted  there they go againagain    watch video   memo to oaktree clients from howard marks re there they go againagain latest memo from howard marks there they go againagain some of the memos i’m happiest about having written came at times when bullish trends went too far risk aversion disappeared and bubbles inflated  the first and best example is probably “bubblecom” which raised questions about internet and ecommerce stocks on the first business day of   as i tell it after ten years without a single response that one made my memo writing an overnight success    another was “the race to the bottom” february  which talked about the mindless shouldering of risk that takes place when investors are eager to put money to work  both of those memos raised doubts about investment trends that soon turned out to have been big mistakes   those are only two of the many cautionary memos i’ve written over the years  in the last cycle they started coming two years before “the race to the bottom” and included “there they go again” the inspiration for this memo’s title “hindsight first please” “everyone knows” and “it’s all good”  when i wrote them they appeared to be wrong for a while  it took time before they were shown to have been right and just too early    the memos that have raised yellow flags in the current upcycle starting with “how quickly they forget” in  and including “on uncertain ground” “ditto” and “the race is on” also clearly were early but so far they’re not right and in fact when you’re early by six or more years it’s not clear you can ever be described as having been right  since i’ve written so many cautionary memos you might conclude that i’m just a born worrier who eventually is made to be right by the operation of the cycle as is inevitable given enough time  i absolutely cannot disprove that interpretation  but my response would be that it’s essential to take note when sentiment and thus market behavior crosses into toobullish territory even though we know rising trends may well roll on for some time and thus that such warnings are often premature  i think it’s better to turn cautious too soon and thus perhaps underperform for a while rather than too late after the downslide has begun making it hard to trim risk achieve exits and cut losses   since i’m convinced “they” are at it again – engaging in willing risktaking funding risky deals and creating risky market conditions – it’s time for yet another cautionary memo  too soon  i hope so we’d rather make money for our clients in the next year or two than see the kind of bust that gives rise to bargains  we all want there to be bargains but no one’s eager to endure the price declines that create them  since we never know when risky behavior will bring on a market correction i’m going to issue a warning today rather than wait until one is upon us   i’m in the process of writing another book going into great depth regarding one of the most important things discussed in my book the most important thing cycles their causes and what to do about them  it will be out next year but this memo will give you a preview regarding one of the most important cyclical phenomena   before starting in i want to apologize for the length of this memo almost double the norm  first the topic is wideranging – so much so that when i sat down to write i found the task daunting  second my recent vacation gave me the luxury of time for writing  believe it or not i’ve cut what i could  i think what remains is essential today’s investment environment because i don’t intend this to be a “macro memo” incorporating a thorough review of the economic and market environment i’ll merely reference what i think are the four most noteworthy components of current conditions   the uncertainties are unusual in terms of number scale and insolubility in areas including secular economic growth the impact of central banks interest rates and inflation political dysfunction geopolitical trouble spots and the longterm impact of technology   in the vast majority of asset classes prospective returns are just about the lowest they’ve ever been   asset prices are high across the board  almost nothing can be bought below its intrinsic value and there are few bargainsin general the best we can do is look for things that are less overpriced than others   prorisk behavior is commonplace as the majority of investors embrace increased risk as the route to the returns they want or need   ditto in january  i wrote a memo entitled “ditto”  its thrust was that a history tends to repeat b thus my memos often return to the same topics and c if i’ve handled them well in the past rather than reinvent the wheel i might as well borrow from what i’ve written before  ergo “ditto”   few topics are more susceptible to this treatment than the process through which a investment fundamentals fluctuate cyclically b investors overreact to the fluctuations c the level of risk aversion incorporated in investor behavior fluctuates between excessive and inadequate and thus d market conditions swing from depressed to elevated and treacherous  here’s how i summed up on this topic in “there they go again” may    given today’s paucity of prospective return at the lowrisk end of the spectrum and the solutions being ballyhooed at the highrisk end many investors are moving capital to riskier or at least less traditional investments  but a they’re making those riskier investments just when the prospective returns on those investments are the lowest they’ve ever been b they’re accepting return increments for stepping up in risk that are as slim as they’ve ever been and c they’re signing up today for things they turned down or did less of in the past when the prospective returns were much higher  this may be exactly the wrong time to add to risk in pursuit of more return  you want to take risk when others are fleeing from it not when they’re competing with you to do so   do you see any differences between then and now  is there any need to redo this description  not for me i think “ditto” will suffice  i’ll simply go on to borrow the conclusion from “the race to the bottom” february    today’s financial market conditions are easily summed up  there’s a global glut of liquidity minimal interest in traditional investments little apparent concern about risk and skimpy prospective returns everywhere  thus as the price for accessing returns that are potentially adequate but lower than those promised in the past investors are readily accepting significant risk in the form of heightened leverage untested derivatives and weak deal structures  the current cycle isn’t unusual in its form only its extent  there’s little mystery about the ultimate outcome in my opinion but at this point in the cycle it’s the optimists who look best the seeds for a boom my son andrew worked extensively with me in preparing this memo  we particularly enjoyed making a list of the elements that typically form the foundation for a bull market boom or bubble  we concluded that some or all of the following are necessary conditions  a few will give us a bull market  all of them together will deliver a boom or bubble   a benign environment – good results lull investors into complacency as they get used to having their positive expectations rewardedgains in the recent past encourage the heated pursuit of further gains in the future rather than suggest that past gains might have borrowed from future gains a grain of truth – the story supporting a boom isn’t created out of whole cloth it generally coalesces around something realthe seed usually isn’t imaginary just eventually overblown early success – the gains enjoyed by the “wise man in the beginning” – the first to seize upon the grain of truth – tends to attract “the fool in the end” who jumps in too late more money than ideas – when capital is in oversupply it is inevitable that risk aversion dries up gullibility expands and investment standards are relaxed willing suspension of disbelief – the quest for gain overcomes prudence and deference to historyeveryone concludes “this time it’s different”no story is too good to be true rejection of valuation norms – all we hear is “the asset is so great there’s no price too high”buying into a fad regardless of price is the absolute hallmark of a bubble the pursuit of the new – old timers fare worst in a boom with the gains going disproportionately to those who are untrammeled by knowledge of the past and thus able to buy into an entirely new future the virtuous circle – no one can see any end to the potential of the underlying truth or how high it can push the prices of related assetsit’s broadly accepted that trees can grow to the sky “it can only go upnothing can stop it”certainly no one can picture things taking a turn for the worse fear of missing out – when all the above becomes widespread optimism prevails and no one can imagine a glitchthat causes most people to conclude that the greatest potential error lies in failing to participate in the current market darling   certainly many of the things listed above are in play today  performance has been good – with minor exceptions quickly rectified – since the beginning of  that’s more than eight years  there’s certainly more money around these days than highreturn possibilities  “new ideas” are readily accepted and some things are viewed as representing virtuous circles    on the other hand some of the usual ingredients are missing  most people a are conscious of the uncertainties listed above b recognize that prospective returns are quite skimpy and c accept that things are unlikely to go well forever  that’s all healthy   but on the third hand most people can’t think of what might cause trouble anytime soon  but it’s precisely when people can’t see what it is that could make things turn down that risk is highest since they tend not to price in risks they can’t see  with the negative catalyst so elusive and the return on cash at punitive levels people worry more about being underinvested or bearing too little risk and thus earning too low a return in good markets than they do about losing money    this combination of elements presents today’s investors with a highly challenging environment  the result is a world in which assets have appreciated significantly risk aversion is low and propositions are accepted that would be questioned if investors were more wary     most of what remains for the meat of this memo will consist of descriptions of things afoot in the markets today  they are intended – as usual with my memos – to be anecdotal and thoughtprovoking not complete and scientific  think about how many of the things listed above you see in the examples that follow   us equities the good news is that the us economy is the envy of the world with the highest growth rate among developed nations and a slowdown unlikely in the near term  the bad news is that this status generates demand for us equities that has raised their prices to lofty levels   the sp  is selling at  times trailingtwelvemonth earnings compared to a longterm median of  the shiller cyclically adjusted pe ratio stands at almost  versus a historic median of   this multiple was exceeded only in  and  – both clearly bubbles while the “p” in pe ratios is high today the “e” has probably been inflated by cost cutting stock buybacks and merger and acquisition activity  thus today’s reported valuations while high may actually be understated relative to underlying profits the “buffett yardstick” – total us stock market capitalization as a percentage of gdp – is immune to companylevel accounting issues although it isn’t perfect either  it hit a new alltime high last month of around  as opposed to a  norm of about  and a  median of about  finally it can be argued that even the normal historic valuations aren’t merited since economic growth may be slower in the coming years than it was in the postworld war ii period when those norms were established   the thing that is clearest is that the low fedmandated shortterm interest rates make high valuations seem reasonable  when yields are low on fixed income instruments low earnings yields on equities that is low ep ratios which equate to high pe ratios seem justified  as buffett said in february “measured against interest rates stocks actually are on the cheap side compared to historic valuations”   but he went on to say “   the risk always is that interest rates go up a lot and that brings stocks down”  are you happy counting on continued low interest rates for your investment security especially at a time when the fed has embarked upon a series of rate increases  and if interest rates do remain low for several more years isn’t it likely to be as a result of a lack of vigor in the economy which would likely cause earnings growth to be sluggish   vix the value of an option contract is largely a function of the volatility of the asset under option  for example the owner of a “call” has the right – but not the obligation – to buy something at a fixed “strike price”  thus he should hope the asset will be volatile if its price rises a lot he can buy at the strike price and sell at the new higher price locking in a profit  and what if it goes down a lot  no matter he isn’t obligated to buy   thus the expected volatility of the underlying asset is a key ingredient in determining the proper price for an option  for example everything else being equal the more volatile an asset is expected to be the more the buyer of a call should be willing to pay for it since he participates in the gains but not the losses and the more the seller of a call should charge for it since he is forgoing upside potential but retaining downside risk  this is reflected through optionpricing formulas such as the blackscholes model    the formulas can also be used backwards  starting with the option price you can figure out what level of volatility the buyers and sellers are anticipating  thus ever since  the chicago board options exchange has published the cboe volatility index or “vix” showing how volatile investors in options on the sp  expect it to be over the next  days  the attention paid to the vix has increased in recent years and it has come to be called the “complacency index” or the “investor fear gauge”  when the vix is low investors are pricing in stable tranquil markets and when it’s high they’re anticipating major ups and downs   the bottom line is that last week’s vix was the lowest in its year history – matching a level seen only once before  the index was last this low when bill clinton took office in  at a time when there was peace in the world faster economic growth and a much smaller deficit  should people really be as complacent now as they were then   what’s the significance of the vix anyway  most importantly it doesn’t say what volatility will be only what investors think volatility will be  thus it’s primarily an indicator of investor sentiment  in “expert opinion” i quoted warren buffett as having said “forecasts usually tell us more of the forecaster than of the future”  in a similar way the vix tells us more about people’s mood today than it does about volatility tomorrow   all we really know is that implied volatility expectations are low today  as with most things in investing the vix can be subject to multiple interpretations  as business insider wrote on july    while alarmists may view this low level of vix as a negative — a signal that complacency has made traders vulnerable to an unforeseen shock — many investors simply see it as a byproduct of conditions ideal for stocks to continue edging higher   i would add one last thing people extrapolate  so when volatility has been low they tend to assume it will be low and build that assumption into the prices for options and assets  the two are not the same   superstocks bull markets are often marked by the anointment of a single group of stocks as “the greatest” and the attractive legend surrounding this group is among the factors that support the bull move  when taken to the extreme – as it invariably is – this phenomenon satisfies some of the elements in a boom listed on page four including   trust in a virtuous circle incapable of being interrupted conviction that given the companies’ fundamental merit there’s no price too high for their stocks and the willing suspension of disbelief that allows investors to extrapolate these positive views to infinity   in the current iteration these attributes are being applied to a small group of techbased companies which are typified by “the faangs” facebook amazon apple netflix and google now renamed alphabet  they all sport great business models and unchallenged leadership in their markets  most importantly they’re viewed as having captured the future and thus as sure to be winners in the years to come   true as far as it goes    just as it appeared to be true of the niftyfifty in the s oil stocks in the ’s disk drive companies in the ’s and techmediatelecom in the late ’s  but in each of those cases   the environment changed in unforeseen ways it turned out that the newness of the business model had hidden its flaws competition arose excellence in the concept gave rise to weaknesses in execution andor it was shown that even great fundamentals can become overpriced and thus give way to massive losses   the faangs are truly great companies growing rapidly and trouncing the competition where it exists  but some are doing so without much profitability and for others profits are growing slower than revenues  some of them doubtless will be the great companies of tomorrow  but will they all  are they invincible and is their success truly inevitable   the prices investors are paying for these stocks generally represent  or more years of the companies current earnings there are clear reasons to be excited about their growth in the near term but what about the durability of earnings over the long term where much of the value in a highmultiple stock necessarily lies  andrew points out that the iphone is just ten years old and twenty years ago the internet wasnt in widespread use  that raises the question of whether investors in technology can really see the future and thus how happy they should be paying prices that incorporate optimistic assumptions regarding longterm earnings power  of course this may just mean the best is yet to come for these fairly young companies here’s a passage from one company’s  letter to shareholders   we established longterm relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy   how many of these “important strategic partners” still exist in a meaningful way today leaving aside the question of whether they’re important or strategic  the answer is zero unless you believe yahoo satisfies the criteria in which case the answer is one  the source of the citation is amazon’s  annual report and the bottom line is that the future is unpredictable and nothing and no company is immune to glitches   the superstocks that lead a bull market inevitably become priced for perfection  and in many cases the companies’ perfection turns out eventually to be either illusory or ephemeral  some of the “can’t lose” companies of the niftyfifty were ultimately crippled by massive changes in their markets including kodak polaroid xerox sears and simplicity pattern do you see many people sewing their own clothes these days  not only did the perfection that investors had paid for evaporate but even the successful companies’ stock prices reverted to morenormal valuation multiples resulting in subpar equity returns    the powerful multiple expansion that makes a small number of stocks the leaders in a bull market is often reversed in the correction that follows saddling them with the biggest losses  but when the mood is positive and things are going well the likelihood of such a development is easily overlooked   finally a rationale often arises to the effect that thanks to market technicals investors’ powerful buying of the leading stocks is sure to continue nonstop meaning they can’t help but remain the best performers  in the tech bubble of the late ’s for example investors concluded that   stocks were doing so well that they would continue to attract capital since tech companies and tech stocks were the best performers they were sure to continue attracting a disproportionate share of the new buying the superior performance of the tech stocks would cause more of them to be added to the stock indices this would require index funds and closet indexers to direct a rising share of their buying to tech stocks in order to keep up with the returns on the indices benchmarkconscious active managers would have to respond by increasing their tech stock holdings and thus tech stocks couldn’t fail to attract an everrising share of buying and were sure to keep outperforming   you can call this a virtuous circle or a perpetual motion machine  it’s the kind of thing that fires investors’ imaginations in a bull market  but the logic that says it will work forever always collapses sometimes just under its own weight as was the case in    many of the most important considerations in investing are counterintuitive  one of those is the ability to understand that no market niche or group is likely to outperform the others forever  given human nature “the best” will always come eventually to be overpriced even for their stellar fundamentals  thus even if the fundamentals hold up the stocks’ performance from those toohigh prices will become ordinary  and if they turn out not really to have been the best – or if their business falters – the combination of fundamental decline and multiple contraction can be really painful   i’m not saying the faangs aren’t great or that they’ll suffer such a fate  just that their elevated status today is a sign of the kind of investor optimism for which we must be on the lookout passive investingetfs fifty years ago shortly after arriving at the university of chicago for graduate school i was taught that thanks to market efficiency a assets are priced to provide fair riskadjusted returns and b no one can consistently find the exceptions  in other words “you can’t beat the market”  our professors even advanced the idea of buying a little bit of each stock as a can’tfail lowcost way to outperform the stockpickers   john bogle put that suggestion into practice  having founded vanguard a year earlier he launched the first index investment trust in  the first index fund to reach commercial scale  as a vehicle designed to emulate the sp  it was later renamed the vanguard  index fund   the concept of indexation or passive investing grew gradually over the next four decades until it accounted for  of equity mutual fund assets in   given the generally lagging performance of active managers over the last dozen or so years as well as the creation of etfs or exchangetraded funds which make transacting simpler the shift from active to passive investing has accelerated  today it’s a powerful movement that has expanded to cover  of equity fund assets  in the last ten years  trillion has flowed into index mutual funds and etfs and  trillion out of actively managed mutual funds   like all investment fashions passive investing is being warmly embraced for its positives   passive portfolios have outperformed active investing over the last decade or so with passive investing you’re guaranteed not to underperform the index finally the much lower fees and expenses on passive vehicles are certain to constitute a permanent advantage relative to active management   does that mean passive investing index funds and etfs are a nolose proposition  certainly not   while passive investors protect against the risk of underperforming they also surrender the possibility of outperforming the recent underperformance on the part of active investors may well prove to be cyclical rather than permanent as a product of the last several years etfs’ promise of liquidity has yet to be tested in a major bear market particularly in lessliquid fields like high yield bonds   here are a few more things worth thinking about   remember the wisdom of passive investing stems from the belief that the efforts of active investors cause assets to be fairly priced – that’s why there are no bargains to find  but what happens when the majority of equity investment comes to be managed passively  then prices will be freer to diverge from “fair” and bargains and overpricings should become more commonplace  this won’t assure success for active managers but certainly it will satisfy a necessary condition for their efforts to be effective   one of my clients the chief investment officer of a pension fund told me the treasurer had proposed dumping all active managers and putting the whole fund into index funds and etfs  my response was simple ask him how much of the fund he’s comfortable having in assets no one is analyzing    as steven bregman of horizon kinetics puts it “basketbased mechanistic investing” is blindly moving trillions of dollars  etfs don’t have fundamental analysts and because they don’t question valuations they don’t contribute to price discovery  not only is the number of active managers’ analysts likely to decline if more money is shifted to passive investing but people should also wonder about who’s setting the rules that govern passive funds’ portfolio construction   the low fees and expenses that make passive investments attractive mean their organizers have to emphasize scale  to earn higher fees than index funds and achieve profitable scale etf sponsors have been turning to “smarter” notexactlypassive vehicles  thus etfs have been organized to meet or create demand for funds in specialized areas such as various stock categories value or growth stock characteristics low volatility or high quality types of companies or geographies  there are passive etfs for people who want growth value high quality low volatility and momentum  going to the extreme investors now can choose from funds that invest passively in companies that have genderdiverse senior management practice “biblically responsible investing” or focus on medical marijuana solutions to obesity serving millennials and whiskey and spirits    but what does “passive” mean when a vehicle’s focus is so narrowly defined  each deviation from the broad indices introduces definitional issues and nonpassive discretionary decisions  passive funds that emphasize stocks reflecting specific factors are called “smartbeta funds” but who can say the people setting their selection rules are any smarter than the active managers who are so disrespected these days  bregman calls this “semantic investing” meaning stocks are chosen on the basis of labels not quantitative analysis  there are no absolute standards for which stocks represent many of the characteristics listed above    importantly organizers wanting their “smart” products to reach commercial scale are likely to rely heavily on the largestcapitalization mostliquid stocks  for example having apple in your etf allows it to get really big  thus apple is included today in etfs emphasizing tech growth value momentum largecaps high quality low volatility dividends and leverage    here’s what barron’s had to say earlier this month   with capweighted indexes index buyers have no discretion but to load up on stocks that are already overweight and often pricey and neglect those already underweight  that’s the opposite of buy low sell high   the large positions occupied by the top recent performers – with their swollen market caps – mean that as etfs attract capital they have to buy large amounts of these stocks further fueling their rise  thus in the current upcycle overweighted liquid largecap stocks have benefitted from forced buying on the part of passive vehicles which don’t have the option to refrain from buying a stock just because its overpriced    like the tech stocks in  this seeming perpetual motion machine is unlikely to work forever  if funds ever flow out of equities and thus etfs what has been disproportionately bought will have to be disproportionately sold  it’s not clear where index funds and etfs will find buyers for their overweighted highly appreciated holdings if they have to sell in a crunch  in this way appreciation that was driven by passive buying is likely to eventually turn out to be rotational not perpetual   finally the systemic risks to the stock market have to be considered  bregman calls “the index universe a big crowded momentum trade”  a handful of stocks – the faangs and a few more – are responsible for a rising percentage of the sp’s gains meaning the stock market’s health may be overstated    all the above factors raise questions about the likely effectiveness of passive vehicles – and especially smartbeta etfs    is apple a safe stock or a stock that has performed well of late  is anyone thinking about the difference are investors who invest in a number of passive vehicles described in different ways likely to achieve the diversification liquidity and safety they expect and what should we think about the willingness of investors to turn over their capital to a process in which neither individual holdings nor portfolio construction is the subject of thoughtful analysis and decisionmaking and in which buying takes place regardless of price   credit corporate debt instruments are good candidates for spotting bullmarket behavior given that unlike equities for example we can readily determine their prospective returns  we know that as described in “the race to the bottom” in overpopulated markets providers of credit compete to make loans and investments that embody low returns weak structures and slender margins of safety    whatever the level of fundamental risk sometimes the reward for bearing it is demonstrably inadequate and sometimes it is highly excessive  it’s an oversimplification but sometimes i think we could base our strategic decisions almost exclusively on the relationship between risk in the market and investors’ willingness to bear it   it’s very helpful to know – and a lot of my new book will be about – where we stand in that swing  in that regard i’ll remind you that “the race to the bottom” was prompted by a financial times article about uk banks’ willingness to compete for mortgage business by increasing the multiple of annual income they would lend  earlier this month ironically i read the following in another london newspaper the daily mail   in a chilling echo of the subprime mortgage crisis of  car finance firms packaged and sold £ billion of risky loan debt to investors last year – twice as much as the year before   such eagerness to finance lowquality loans will always be a sign of elevated overfinanced riskoblivious credit markets  at the late trough of the financial crisis high yield bonds and leveraged loans yielded almost  basis points more than comparable treasurys meaning anyone who bought and held couldn’t really lose  then as investors recovered their equilibrium and bought prices rose and the yield spread contracted  now the spread is merely average relative to history – a few hundred basis points  the net yields on these securities are still highly likely to be well in excess of those on treasurys but any capital appreciation would have to come from further spread contraction and that certainly can’t be counted upon   the credit investors of today clearly aren’t gunshy leaving investment opportunities to languish at excessive yields and yield spreads  at best these investments are fairly priced today in relative terms and fully priced – offering low returns like everything else – in absolute terms   i’ll use an example to illustrate the acceptance being accorded lowgrade credit instruments  in early may netflix issued € billion of eurobonds the lowestcost debt it ever issued  the interest rate was  the covenants were few and the rating was singleb  netflix’s gaap earnings run about  million per quarter but according to grant’s interest rate observer in the year that ended march  netflix burned through  billion of free cash flow  it’s an exciting company but as grant’s reminded its readers bondholders can’t participate in gains just losses  given this asymmetrical proposition any bond issue should be characterized by solidity and a meaningful promised return not the sex appeal of its issuer   is it prudent to lend money to a company that goes through it at such a prodigious rate  will amazon or google be able to loosen netflix’s hold on its customers  is it wise to buy bonds based on a technology position that could be overtaken  positive investor sentiment has taken the company’s equity value to  billion what would happen to the bond price if worries about rising competition took a bite out of that one day  should you take these risks to make less than  per year  in oaktree’s view this isn’t a solid debt investment it’s an equitylinked digital content investment totally lacking in upside potential and it’s not for us  the fact that deals like this can get done easily should tell you something about today’s market climate   finally let’s consider whether risk tolerance and carefree behavior are isolated or widespread in today’s credit market  here are some quotes from a july  article by lisa abramowicz of bloomberg gadfly emphasis added   over the last eight years junkrated corporate debt has been transformed from a fringe asset to a staple for many fixedincome investors  as they’ve become more popular these risky bonds and loans have increasingly lost a feature that made them so attractive and lucrative – the investor protections known as covenants written into the documents that govern the debt  these are aimed at ensuring investors can recover their money if the company fails   last month the  billion of junk bonds sold had the highest proportion of deals on record with weak investor protections moody’s investor service reported this week  about  percent of the risky us corporate bonds sold had few protections written into their deal documents moody’s said  in the leveragedloan market nearly three quarters of the debt is “covenant lite” after three years of record issuance       investors have grown so confident about the seemingly interminable corporatedebt rally that many are dismissing the likelihood of large swaths of risky companies going bankrupt  after all these covenants usually don’t matter until there’s a problem   it’s a standard cycle cautious investing produces good performance in a salutary environment    which leads to a reduction of caution    which leads to bad performance when the environment turns less favorable  this is part of the race to the bottom i wrote about in    emerging market debt the emerging markets are another place where investor opinion fluctuates wildly and visibly  “everyone knows” the emerging markets have more growth potential than the developed world but attitudes regarding the realizability of that potential – and thus the price one should pay for it – gyrate wildly over time   i described the phenomenon in “the role of confidence” august   when confidence is running high the emerging markets are viewed as being just like developed markets only fastergrowing meaning it’s reasonable for their securities to sell at yields and pe ratios like those in the developed world  but when confidence declines it becomes clear that there are risks that don’t exist in the developed world – like coups institutionalized corruption maxidevaluation and debt repudiation – and thus significant valuation discounts are in order  again as with corporate credit which is this  are investors appropriately sensitive to the risks and imposing reasonable discounts or are they ignoring the risks and happily paying up  that’s a lot of what you have to know   to answer the question i’ll make reference to  billion of bonds that were issued by argentina in midjune  the maturity was  years – “century bonds” – and the interest rate was     you might have thought this would be a hard thing to sell  after all argentina had defaulted on its debts eight times in its year history with no fewer than five defaults in the past century alone most recently in  amid a legal dispute with the elliott hedge fund      but investors do not seem to care there were bn of bids  and argentina is not the only peculiar event in bond markets this month  take a look for example at ivory coast  in recent weeks this west african nation underwent yet another military uprising  but this month it sold year bonds with a  per cent yield – and these were also heavily oversubscribed  places such as senegal and egypt have also seen hot demand for their debt  financial times june    to conclude on this subject i can’t resist citing but am too polite to name the head of research and strategy for a likewiseunnamed brokerinvestment bank   “it’s just shocking that they exit default and their bond issue is a century bond” said ms x    nevertheless she is advising her clients to buy the bonds as at least a short term trade    let me get this straight it’s incredible that argentina is able to issue this thing but it’s a good buy for a moment  it’s a sign of the times “something may go wrong but probably not soon”  i much prefer warren buffett’s view “if you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes”   for only the third time in history emerging market debt is selling at yields below those on us high yield bonds  is argentina a country that defaulted five times in the last hundred years and once in the last five likely to get through the next hundred without a rerun      the essential bottom line in all investing is simple is the risk premium at least adequate  can we answer in the affirmative with regard to emerging market debt today   private equity in today’s lowreturn world it’s clear that institutional investors needing  a year aren’t likely to get it from treasurys yielding  high grades at  or mainstream stocks that most people expect to return   heck you can’t even get it from ivory coast bonds  where is one to turn   the good news for firms like oaktree is that the answer is felt to most likely lie in what have come to be called “alternative investments” there was no collective term for them when my partners and i started off  years ago  since essentially no public “beta” markets offer the returns institutions need many have turned instead to socalled “alpha strategies” where skillful active management has the potential to augment market returns producing what’s needed   but one of the biggest alternatives categories – hedge funds – has been largely discredited as a result of the meager average return over the last dozen years  and some of the others like venture capital are hard to access and too small to absorb much capital  that brings investors mainly to real estate distressed debt and especially private equity   private equity firms market doubledigit return track records and even their topofthecycle  funds now sport respectable gains  as a result they’re attracting capital at alltimehigh rates   private equity is experiencing the best fundraising climate in years – perhaps ever in the first half of the year  north americafocused funds closed raising  billion while globally there have been  private equity funds closed which raised a combined  billion surpassing slightly the record  billion raised in  according to preqin  mergers  acquisitions newsletter   private equity funds have been raising total capital in the hundreds of billions for the last few years and even before the latest spate of megafunds they already had several hundred billion of “dry powder”  importantly since private equity managers mostly engage in leveraged buyouts these amounts have to be viewed in terms of the leveredup total capital they’ll produce  thus the pe firms will probably add more than a trillion dollars to their buying power this year  where will it be invested at a time when few assets can be bought at bargain prices  sellers of private companies too tend to set asking prices for their firms based on what cash flows are worth in this lowreturn world   i’m not saying private equity isn’t a solution or even that it’s not the best solution  it’s just that its record fundraising is yet one more sign of the willingness of investors to trust in the future   softbank vision fund perhaps the ultimate demonstration of faith in fund managers is softbank’s recent raising of  billion for its vision fund for technology investments – presumably on the way to  billion  softbank is a japanese telecom company showing an year annual return of  on investments that have included chipmakers ridehailing and telecom  but i see issues with the fund    first softbank’s record of investment success has relied heavily on one phenomenal investment  the  million softbank invested in alibaba in  has grown in value to more than  billion  skill or luck  and extrapolatable   second size matters  in  the venture capital industry got into trouble because it followed massively successful mids funds of hundreds of millions with funds of  billion  the vision fund isn’t for startups but still can you wisely invest  billion in technology   third here’s an organization that has never managed money for third parties starting the biggest fund in history to do just that  is their experience transferrable  in all these regards i think the fund indicates a high level of enthusiasm and a low level of skepticism   fourth and perhaps more importantly for my purposes here i want to spend some time on the fund’s structure  for each  cents they put into the fund’s equity outside investors are required to put  cents into preferred units of the fund  on the other hand softbank itself invested  billion in equity but nothing in preferred    that means when the fund reaches  billion softbank will have put up only  of the capital but will own  of the equity  adding in management fees and carried interest its  of the capital may give it  of the gains even the private equity industry – with its willingness to take risk – has traditionally shied away from piling debt on technology companies although less so lately  softbank doesn’t hesitate to lever its tech investments the preferred units will pay a  annual couponlending money to a tech fund at that modest rate apparently is part of the price demanded of the lps for an opportunity to invest in the fund’s equity  i can imagine the sales pitch about how lucky the lps are to get a chance to provide leverage for their own investment but i doubt i’d be convinced finally as the financial times wrote on june    while the preferred unit holders will eventually receive their principal back plus  per year they will only receive an equity return for the equity portion of their investment in the fund   all outside backers of the fund are receiving  per cent in preferred units and the rest in equity allowing them to reduce their downside risk while still generating a good return   sounds good on the surface  but how much does this diversion of the investors’ capital into preferred units really reduce their downside risk  the ft says investors in the preferred units “will eventually receive their principal back”  should that really be “will” or perhaps “may” or “hopefully will”  does a  million investment in the fund put only the  million of equity at risk or is there risk associated with the preferred too  i guess i don’t consider the preferred units as rocksolid as the ft suggests  aren’t they more like the netflix bonds techlinked downside with no upside  would an arm’slength lender give an lp money at  to lever his equity in this fund  times   the willingness of investors to invest in a shockingly large fund for levered tech investing with a questionable structure is a further indication of an exuberant unquestioning market   digital currencies the discussion of innovative investments brings me to bitcoin ether and other digital currencies  i’d guess these things have arisen from the intersection of a doubts about financial security – including the value of national currencies – that grew out of the financial crisis and b the comfort felt by millennials regarding all things virtual  but they’re not real   some businesses accept bitcoin as payment  some buyers want to own ether because it can be used to pay for computing power on the ethereum network  some people are eager to speculate on digital currency for profit  others want to put a little money into these todateprofitable phenomena rather than run the risk of missing out  but they’re not real   people tell me these currencies are solid because a they’re secure against hacking and counterfeiting and b the software used to generate them strictly limits the amount that can be created  but they’re not real  nobody has been able to make sense to me of these currencies  here are a few paragraphs on ether from the new york times of june    the sudden rise of ethereum highlights how volatile the bewildering world of virtual currency remains where lines of code can be spun into billions of dollars in a matter of months      ethereum was launched in the middle of  by a yearold college dropout vitalik buterin     mr buterin was inspired by bitcoin and the software he built shares some of the same basic qualities  both are hosted and maintained by the computers of volunteers around the world who are rewarded for their participation with new digital tokens that are released into the network every day    because the virtual currencies are tracked and maintained by a network of computers no government or company is in charge  the prices of both bitcoin and ether are established on private exchanges where people can sell the tokens they own at the going market price      many new currency applications being built on ethereum are also raising money using the ether currency in what are known as initial coin offerings a play on initial public offerings   startups that have followed this path have generally collected ether from investors and exchanged them for units of their own specialized virtual currency leaving the entrepreneurs with the ether to convert into dollars and spend on operational expenses   these coin offerings which have proliferated in recent months have created a surge of demand for the ether currency  just last week investors sent  million worth of ether to a startup bancor that wants to make it easier to launch virtual currencies    bottom line you can use the imaginary currency ether to buy other new imaginary currencies or to invest in new companies that will create other new currencies  in “bubblecom” i highlighted some illogical aspects of ecommerce by including some of my father’s old jokes regarding how to make money  here’s another that seems  appropriate for the digital currency movement   two guys meet in the street  joe tells bob about the hamster he has for sale pedigreed and highly intelligent  bob says he’d like to buy a hamster for his kid “how much is it”  joe answers “half a million” and bob tells him he’s crazy   they meet again the next day  “how’d you do with that hamster”  bob asks  “sold it” says joe  “did you get ” bob asks  “sure” says joe  “cash”  “no” joe answers “i took two  canaries”   one of my very favorite quotes concerning the market’s foibles from john kenneth galbraith says that in euphoric times “past experience to the extent that it is part of memory at all is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present”   maybe i’m just a dinosaur too technologically backward to appreciate the greatness of digital currency  but it is my firm view that the ability of these things to gain acceptance is just one more proof of the prevalence today of financial naiveté willing risktaking and wishful thinking    in my view digital currencies are nothing but an unfounded fad or perhaps even a pyramid scheme based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it  but this isn’t the first time  the same description can be applied to the tulip mania that peaked in  the south sea bubble  and the internet bubble      serious investing consists of buying things because the price is attractive relative to intrinsic value  speculation on the other hand occurs when people buy something without any consideration of its underlying value or the appropriateness of its price solely because they think others will pay more for it in the future     it isn’t unreasonable for someone to use bitcoin to pay for something – or for a seller to accept bitcoin in payment – based on an agreement between the parties barter takes place all the time  but does that make it “currency”    the price of bitcoin has more than doubled since the start of the year  can something that does that seriously be considered a “medium of exchange” or “store of value” rather than the subject of a speculative mania  maybe not but bitcoin looks staid in comparison to ether which has appreciated  so far this year  the outstanding ether is now worth  as much as all the bitcoin in the world up from  at the beginning of the year      the new york times notes that together the outstanding bitcoin and ether are worth more than paypal and almost as much as goldman sachs  would you rather own all of the two digital currencies or one of those companies  in other words are these currencies’ values real  they’re likely to keep working as long as optimism is present but their performance in bad times is far from dependable  what will happen to bitcoin’s price and liquidity in a crisis if people decide they’d rather hold dollars or gold   we agree but    andrew told me about a conversation he had recently with some fund managers in which he went over a lot of what i’m discussing here  given today’s conditions their response started predictably “we agree but   ”                                              we hear a lot of that these days   we agree but the things we’re doing offer higher returns than the rest we agree but cash isn’t an option when it returns nearly nothing we agree but we can’t take the risk of being out of the market we agree but there’s no alternative   investors should choose their risk posture based on an assessment of what’s being offered in terms of absolute return absolute risk and thus absolute riskadjusted return  but today – on that famous other hand – investors generally don’t have the luxury of holding out for absolute returns and safety like they enjoyed in the past   many of the things i’ve highlighted above offer good returns and risk premiums relative to the returns on treasurys and high grade debt  but a low rates may be – generally are expected to be – a temporary condition and b it might be wiser to gauge reward in absolute terms  the bottom line is that while the prices and prospective returns on many things are justifiable today relative to other things you can’t eat or spend relative returns    everyone’s investing on the basis of relatives these days they see no alternative  but that reminds me of former citigroup ceo chuck prince who gained fame in the months leading up to the global financial crisis for saying of the bank’s leveraged lending practices “when the music stops in terms of liquidity things will be complicated  but as long as the music is playing you’ve got to get up and dance  we’re still dancing”  today i think most investors know the good times will end someday as prince did but for now they feel they too have no choice but to dance   and there’s one other thing we hear a lot these days   we agree things can’t go well forever – we agree the cycle is extended prices are elevated and uncertainty is high – but we don’t see anything that’s likely to bring the bull market to a close anytime soon   in other words there’ll be a time for caution just not today  in that connection andrew reminds me about saint augustine who said “give me chastity and continence but not yet”  is there something other than the punitive returns on safe assets that keeps this from being a time for caution observations and implications as i said most of the phenomena described above seem reasonable given the rest of what’s going on in today’s economic and financial world  but step back for perspective and put them together and what do we see   some of the highest equity valuations in history the socalled vix index of fear at an alltime low the elevation of a can’tlose group of stocks the movement of more than a trillion dollars into valueagnostic investing the lowest yields in history on lowrated bonds and loans yields on emerging market debt that are lower still the most fundraising in history for private equity the biggest fund of all time raised for levered tech investing billions in digital currencies whose value has multiplied dramatically   i absolutely am not saying stocks are too high the faangs will falter credit investing is risky digital currencies are sure to end up worthless or private equity commitments won’t pay off  all i’m saying is that for all the things listed above to simultaneously be gaining in popularity and attracting so much capital credulousness has to be high and risk aversion has to be low  it’s not that these things are doomed just that their returns may not fully justify their risk  and more importantly that they show the temperature of today’s market to be elevated  not a nonsensical bubble – just high and therefore risky   try to think of the things that could knock today’s market off kilter like a surprising spike in inflation a significant slowdown in growth central banks losing control or the big tech stocks running into trouble  the good news is that they all seem unlikely  the bad news is that their unlikelihood causes all these concerns to be dismissed leaving the markets susceptible should any of them actually occur  that means this is a market in which riskiness is being tolerated and perhaps ignored and one in which most investors are happy to bear risk  thus it’s not one in which we should do so   what else   my observations are always indicative not predictive  the usual consequences of the conditions i describe – like an eventual increase in risk aversion – should happen but they don’t have to happen and they certainly don’t have to happen soon  no one knows anything about timingcertain consequences are implied but even if they’re going to happen we have no way of knowing whenit feels like we’re in the eighth inning but i have no idea how long the game will go on i’m never sure of my market observations  as you’ll see in my new book i believe strongly that where we are in a cycle says a lot about the market’s likely tendencies but i never state opinions on this subject with high confidence as a natural worrier i tend to be early with warnings as described on page one  nuff said finally while my observations are uncertain and should be taken with a grain of salt what i am sure of is that valuations and markets are elevated and the easy money in this cycle has been made   what to do to me the four components of the current environment listed on pages  and  – high uncertainty low prospective returns high prices and prorisk behavior – are indisputable  the question is whether you agree  if so i trust you’ll grant that they make for a troubling combination  markets normally respond to elevated uncertainty with lower asset prices and compensatorily higher returns  but not today  thus we’re living in a lowreturn highrisk world  period    for that reason this might seem like an attractive time to refrain from investing or at least from bearing risk  however organizations for which investing is an essential part of the business model – like pension funds insurance companies endowments and sovereign wealth funds – generally don’t have the option to not invest  that’s especially true when the return on cash is as low as it is today    further the case for cash that can be built today from all the above could have been made years ago and doing so would have resulted in huge penalties  oaktree’s investment philosophy generally causes us to eschew the raising and lowering of cash  we might make an exception in extraordinary circumstances but today doesn’t seem to warrant doing so  instead oaktree will continue to follow its  mantra “move forward but with caution” – and given today’s conditions with even more caution than in the recent past  if one is going to invest at times like this investment professionalism – knowing how to bear risk intelligently striving for return while keeping an eagleeye on the potential adverse consequences – is the absolute sine qua non    environments like today’s call to mind the applicability of something i was told more than  years ago by sid cottle editor of the later editions of graham and dodd’s security analysis “investment is the discipline of relative selection”  i interpret that to mean we have no alternative but to choose from among the available options based on their relative merit   “there they go again” was written in may  at the front end of a string of cautionary memos leading up to the last cyclical peak  it was the first time i explicitly raised the question – too early as usual – of how one should invest in a lowreturn world  i went on to list a few possibilities none of which was sure to work but i concluded with the one thing i was convinced of      there’s no easy answer for investors faced with skimpy prospective returns and risk premiums  but there is one course of action – one classic mistake – that i most strongly feel is wrong reaching for return   the events of  and  showed this observation to have been prudent and appropriate  and given today’s similarities to the last cycle i think it’s applicable again   here’s a great observation on the subject from berkshirehathaway’s  letter to shareholders    we agree with investment writer ray devoe’s observation “more money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun” or as peter bernstein put it “the market is not an accommodating machine it won’t give you high returns just because you need them”   the key strategic decision for anyone shaping investment strategy is whether to apply aggressiveness or defensiveness at a given point in time  in other words should we worry more today about losing money or about missing opportunity  the answer at all times depends on what’s available in the investment environment   i have no doubt that the ascent to the apex from which the global financial crisis took place was powered by the willing acceptance of risk in the lowreturn world of   in other words excessive risk tolerance and the resulting incautious behavior provided the foundation for the vast losses experienced in the move from peak to trough   and in the trough of late early ’ i likewise have no doubt that most investors were saying “i don’t care if i ever make another penny in the market i just don’t want to lose any moreget me out”  their excessive risk aversion created the opportunity for the huge returns enjoyed in the recovery   where are we today  as i said earlier risk is high and prospective return is low and the low prospective returns on safe investments are pushing people into taking risk – which they’re willing to do – at a time when the reward for doing so is low    given my view of the environment the only reason to be aggressive today is because defensive investing implies low prospective returns  but the question is whether pursuing high expected returns through aggressiveness can be counted on to be rewarded  if the answer is no as i believe then this is a time for caution    that doesn’t mean you have to be content with a lowreturn portfolio  if you need returns higher than those available in the beta markets at the lowrisk end of the spectrum it is reasonable to move into riskier asset classes  but for every asset class there are highrisk and lowrisk approaches  when the market is rational lowrisk investments will always appear to offer prospective returns lower than those on highrisk ones  but in tough times the former are less likely to bring losses than the latter  in my opinion that makes them right for today                                 perhaps the best way to understand investment cycles is through that great statement attributed to mark twain “history doesn’t repeat but it does rhyme”  the duration pace amplitude and details of each investment cycle are different from those of its predecessors but the basic themes and essential ingredients are usually vaguely familiar  what twain calls rhyming history i describe as “common threads”   the themes or threads that repeatedly characterize toobullish markets are the ones listed on page   while they don’t all have to be present for a top bull market or boom to form a usually many are present when one does and b it’s hard for a fullthroated bubble to come into existence without them  they truly are the raw materials for market excesses on the upside    on the other hand the keys to avoiding the classic mistakes also recur and i listed them in “there they go again”   awareness of history belief in cycles rather than unabated unidirectional trends skepticism regarding the free lunch and insistence on low purchase prices that provide lots of room for error   adherence to these things – all parts of the canon of defensive investing – invariably will cause you to miss the most exciting part of bull markets when trends reach irrational extremes and prices go from fair to excessive  but they’ll also make you a longterm survivor  i can’t help thinking that’s a prerequisite for investment success   the checklist for market sanity and safety is simple and the answers will tell you what to do   are prospective returns adequate are investors appropriately riskaverse are they applying skepticism and discipline are they demanding sufficient risk premiums are valuations reasonable relative to historic standards are deal structures fair to investors are investors declining any of the new deals are there limits on faith in the future   the basic proposition is simple investors make the most and the safest money when they do things other people don’t want to do  but when investors are unworried and glad to make risky investments or worried but investing anyway because the lowrisk alternatives are unappealing asset prices will be high risk premiums will be low and markets will be risky  that’s what happens when there’s too much money and too little fear   i’ll close with a final “ditto” from “the race to the bottom” of just over ten years ago   if you refuse to fall into line in carefree markets like today’s it’s likely that for a while you’ll a lag in terms of return and b look like an old fogey  but neither of those is much of a price to pay if it means keeping your head and capital when others eventually lose theirs  in my experience times of laxness have always been followed eventually by corrections in which penalties are imposed  it may not happen this time but i’ll take that risk  in the meantime oaktree and its
