remember though that a common theme among american frackers is that operations have become exceedingly more efficient than ever before when oil prices collapsed more than two years ago and rigs were mothballed output remained strong so it’s possible that even with fewer rigs actively pumping crude and less capital going into mining structures we could still see domestic production reach  million barrels a day by next year opec compliance at sixmonth low obstructing price appreciation right now is news that a number of opec countries are not complying with production guidance laid out earlier in the year the compliance rate fell from  percent in may to a sixmonth low of  percent in june with monthly output from algeria ecuador gabon iraq the united arab emirates and venezuela totaling more

france and the united kingdom recently said gas and diesel cars would be banned by  india the fastest growing automobile market set a similar target for  even when oil demand peaks—whether in  or —it won’t “go out of fashion overnight” van beurden said planes ships and heavy trucks will continue using fossil fuels all around the globe and smaller emerging markets will not be able to make the transition to renewables so easily as larger economies such as western europe china and india “supply will shrink faster than demand can shrink” he explained “and therefore working on oil and gas
