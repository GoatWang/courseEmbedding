customer service will “be our best product” really by ashlee kielerakieler january   comcast ceo neil smit told a panel at the international ces conference that customer service would soon be the company’s best product comcast is reigning worst company in america champion for a reason we’ve seen story after story after story where consumers have struggled just to get basic service from the company but comcast cable head neil smit was confident or delusional when he told a panel at the international ces that customer service would soon be the best product to come from the company smit told the audience at a “fast innovation” panel wednesday afternoon that comcast is on the way to a complete customer service turnaround “we do need to transform our customer experience and i think we have a lot of work to do” smit said in what might be the understatement of the century “it will take time but we’ll get it done” customer satisfaction surveys have consistently found comcast lagging behind pretty much everyone the most recent customer satisfaction surveys released at the end of december found comcast scoring well below average in “overall satisfaction” in every area in the  american customer satisfaction index comcast doesn’t just score in the bottom for paytv and broadband companies but lowest among all companies beaten only by their acquisition target time warner cable to address customer satisfaction issues smit said the company has already been hard at work by moving their “top product person” and putting him in charge of customer service he was referring to senior vice president of customer experience charlie herrin who the company promised in september would be on hand to fix customers’ cable experiences “we expect that customer service will soon be one of our best products” smit concluded optimistically while we all rolled our eyes tell a friendshare on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on twitter opens in new windowclick to share on

facts you need to know  shares  comments by tucker cummings miller published feb   at pm getty neil smit comcast’s ceo is in the headlines after the hollywood reporter pegged him to “become the most powerful and scrutinized executive in pay television” here’s what you should know about this comcast exec  neil smit isn’t comcast’s only ceo the corporate chain of command at a company like comcast can be a bit confusing the comcast executive biographies page lists neil smit as “president and chief executive officer comcast cable” as well as “executive vice president comcast corporation” brian l roberts another comcast bigwig is listed on the same page as “chairman and chief executive officer comcast corporation”  neil smit makes over  million annually pretty smart of neil smit head of merged

email  neil smit was a navy seal comcast cable president and ceo neil smit on mso’s ongoing metered broadband tests “nothing conclusive there yet” — jeff baumgartner thebauminator february   the los angeles times has reported that smit served as a navy seal for nearly six years at the time of his retirement from the navy smit was a lieutenant commander the la times adds that this former seal is positioned to oversee comcast as it moves forward “neil smit comcast cable chief executive and a former navy seal this week was named comcast’s goto guy the executive who would closely oversee the integration of at least  million time warner cable customers into comcast which already has nearly  million video subscribers that means smit also would be the point man overseeing upgrades to time warner cable’s systems in new york and los angeles where  million homes have time warner cable service”  smit loves new technology in the hollywood reporter‘s analysis of smit they cite a source who refers to smit at “a handson technophile” that seems like a fair assessment given the fact that comcast has launched  products in just the past two years  neil smit is cool under pressure comcasts neil smit says getting nflx on set top box is not high priority but still open to putting apps on x set top box — shalini ramachandran shaliniwsj october   back when he was working for charter communications smit gave an interview with st louis commerce magazine in the interview smit talked about one of his early jobs working for a crisis management firm “their primary business was kidnapping negotiations” smit says “you know as a navy seal when you parachute into a situation you’ve got to figure it out pretty fast this was no different i had to make a quick assessment of a situation plan action and communicate it to everyone involved i did this until we had our first child then my wife said i needed to find a new career” whatever smit is asked to do for comcast in the future it is likely that he will be able to keep his cool even in the most pressurefilled of business situations read more from heavy apple tv with time warner cable content due in april  fast facts

greater depth regarding netflix and ducked questions about what apple and comcast are working on together discussing cordcutting and customers sharing their passwords smit touted comcast’s new packages and college partnerships as ways to win over millennials while he said he believes multiple approaches from over the top to more traditional cable will win in the space he referred to the cost of content multiple times during his talk “we pay  billion a year for content” smit said “one of the things that i question in the aereo solution is are they paying for content the spend for that

news articles oct    am et neil smit president  ceo comcast cable communications • executive vp comcastby jon lafayette   jlafayette even in a tough business like cable not many executives have had navy seal training like comcast cable ceo neil smit has smit’s unit seal team six is the one that took down osama bin laden on may  smit doesn’t talk much about his own service with the secretive seals simply confirming that he saw combat “he doesn’t wear it on his sleeve” says matt bond who was in charge of programming at comcast before moving to nbcuniversal as executive vp of content distribution “i’ve got to believe he’s got a lot to brag about that he’s not bragging about”nevertheless smit’s military background is part of his reputation “i know i would not want to get into a knife fight with him in an alley” says bill goodwyn presidentceo of strategic distribution and discovery education at discovery communications “the good thing about neil is he doesn’t need to go there because intellectually he’s as sound as he is physically that’s good news for people on the other side of the table”abbe raven chairman of ae networks has worked closely with smit on national cable and telecommunications association committees “i have enormous respect for him” raven says “he was a navy seal and he’s been very supportive of the industry’s efforts surrounding hiring veterans in the industry everyone knows he was a hostage negotiator”raven says she has negotiated with smit and “what’s interesting is he does like to win but he really does have an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re winning too and i think that’s something that comes from his background”smit grew up on a farm in suffield conn where he woke early to feed the animals but knew he didn’t want to be a farmer or construction worker like his dad he went to duke on a navy scholarship and signed up for seal training upon graduation after retiring as a lieutenant commander smit earned a master’s degree from tufts’ fletcher school of law and diplomacy he took a job with a company in the business of negotiating with kidnappers but with a growing family decided to pursue a different professionhe joined pillsbury and was assigned to fix ailing operations he became head of pillsbury mexico and moved to argentina when pillsbury made a big acquisition there nabisco hired him away from pillsbury and put him in charge of its latin american business then aol called and he wound up running its subscription business “it was exciting because we were bringing the internet to people” smit sayspaul allen came calling next asking smit to join charter which he ran for four years before comcast chairman and ceo brian roberts recruited him to the nation’s biggest cable operatorroberts says he had admired smit’s unique set of experiences but “you never know someone really well till you’re working together in the pressure cooker” now after four years he says “i can’t imagine anyone doing a better job taking comcast to the next phase of where we want it to go deploying new products nurturing people and setting a tone from the top of ethics hard work and yet humility”in addition to his experience in marketing and technology smit says his seal training has in fact helped him in his civilian career “the first thing you learn in seal team training is it’s all about the team it’s not about the individual” smit says “you learn that you play to win there’s no alternative you make decisions in the situation you make a call you go left or you go right you can adjust later but get out of the line of fire you’ve always got to be developing your skills and your team capabilities you’ve got to be better”he says he also learned lessons about communications “everybody’s got to know what the plan is there’s no room for miscommunications”the theory works in practice despite the natural tension between programmers and operators there’s been none between smit and his predecessor stephen burke who now runs nbcuniversal for comcast roberts says “neil has a point of view of getting problems solved and i think he’s used to being on a team” roberts explains “neil is comfortable as just one of the guys but he can lead i’ve never seen anybody rev up a company and a business with the intensity and the success that neil has had with the xfinity product”things were already running pretty well when he arrived at comcast smit notes “brian and stephen had done a lot of the heavy lifting in getting the platforms in place” he says “i was able to leverage that and innovate at a faster rate we put out almost  new products in the last two years” one of those is the cloudbased entertainment platform x designed to help customers access more content more easilyat a time when containing programming costs is imperative for distributors smit says it’s also important to acquire broader rights to content some of comcast’s products like vod can help drive ratings and one of the benefits of having nbcu under the comcast umbrella is an ability to experiment “i think we work pretty collaboratively with our network partners to bring consumers what i would describe as the future of entertainment” smit says“the definition of a true leader is one who is willing to take risks by searching for solutions that serve the entire industry not just their individual business” says chase carey president and coo of st century fox “this is the compass by which neil operates and what has made comcast a true driving force for bringing consumers better television experiences”that makes cable an exciting place to smit “it’s an especially dynamic time in the industry and i look forward to applying the functionality of the internet to the television and advertising and overall entertainment viewing for the customers” he says see alsobroadcasting  cable hall of fame class of  tagsyou may also like herzog i was the sarah palin of broadcast bc beyond january   next article
