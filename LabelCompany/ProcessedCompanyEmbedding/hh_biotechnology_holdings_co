management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates fair value measurements   the company applies the provisions of asc subtopic  “fair value measurements” for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements  asc  also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements     fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability   asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value   there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a

purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes   the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and

evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules a promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended “exchange act’ as of the end of the period covered by this interim period report  disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our certifying officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based upon that evaluation our certifying officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec due to a weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company  internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis  because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected   management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  based on this evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of september   a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected  at september   the company had only one executive officer performing the functions of chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as a result the company’s internal controls were deficient for the following reasons            ● there were no entity level controls because there was only one person serving in the dual capacity of chief executive officer and chief financial officer ● there was no segregation of duties as that same person was responsible for the process of approving and paying the company’s bills and recording the other financial transactions of the company and ● there was no separate audit committee as a result of management’s evaluation described above it concluded on that the company had significant control deficiencies as of september   that constituted a material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting  notwithstanding these control deficiencies our certifying officer believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the respective periods presented the company proposes to remediate the material weakness as its business develops by engaging accounting support that will effectively segregate different accounting functions and incorporate control processes for managing the accounting and financial affairs of the company  as the company’s business develops it will recruit additional directors who are independent and can otherwise serve on an audit committee that fulfills the traditional oversight functions with respect to our internal system of controls and financial reporting there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the threemonth period ended september   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   part ii  other information   item   exhibits   copies of the following documents are included or furnished as exhibits to this report
