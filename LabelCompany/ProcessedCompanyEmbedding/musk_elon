product  business insider finance bi intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × elon musk has discovered a new passion in life — and it could be teslas best product yet matthew debord may    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print musk introducing solar roof in october of tesla see also the model  arrives friday — heres a look at how teslas cars have evolved over the years elon musk is testing part of a futuristic transport system that could rocket cars through tunnels at  mph heres everything tesla wants to accomplish by  tesla ceo elon is the best car salesman in history and as ceo of spacex hes declared his intention to retire on mars but what are supercarfast electric vehicles and lowearth orbits in the face of  roofing against all odds musk has become perhaps the biggest booster in the history of the roofing business thanks to a new tesla product the solar roof that officially went on sale wednesday its the first postsolar cityacquisition product that tesla is selling and it sounds as if its been occupying at least as much of musks attention as the forthcoming launch of teslas model  car i can honestly say that ive never heard anyone express such enthusiasm about the top of house as someone who has owned a few houses my general reaction to discussions of roofs has been dread they have to be replaced periodically and thats expensive also they have to be repaired and they leak  musk doesnt share this dread just as he has a vision for teslas vehicles and for spacexs marscolonizing ambitions as well as trafficbeating tunnels and artificial intelligence so he has a vision for roofs and its actually rather exciting big on solar a conceptual illustration of an installed solar rooftesla musk has always been big on solar power prior to tesla buying solarcity for over  billion musk was the companys chairman his cousin was the ceo he likes to point out that humanity has a compelling alternative to fossilfuel energy the giant fusion reactor in the sky that bathes the planet every day with free power solar also fits into his master plan which involves eliminating greenhousegas emissions by electrifying transportation backing up the biosphere with spacex which would make humanity a multiplanetary species and powering it all with solar energy solarcity has long been able to sell or lease a homeowner solar panels but the solar roof offers a different value proposition if you have to replace your roof anyway why not replace it with a roof that generates power and saves you money over the long haul  with a yearmortgage if you stay in the house youll replace your roof at least once at a cost of about  you maintain the value of the home but you dont necessarily add much to it the solar roof should last twice as long as a traditional roof and maybe much longer and it will both mitigate your electricity costs and paired with a tesla powerpack battery provide you with backup energy  the upfront costs are high but the overall economics are compelling and in sunny states where electricity is costly such as california a solar roof could net a homeowner tens of thousands of dollar over  years but theres something else that thrills musk even more than the money part its the aesthetics looks are everything such beautytesla tesla will have four different tile choices for the solar roof by  and musk made it clear in a call with reporters wednesday that the company tried really hard to redefine the way we look at the top of our houses  were talking roof envy here something that musk sought to stoke when the solar roof was revealed in los angeles last october check out the sweet roof he joked at the time speculating on previously unheardof dialogue in suburban enclaves that will be early adopters of the tesla design last week he said that tesla had struggled to find sufficiently beautiful roofs upon which to base its designs for the solar roof  we had a hard time finding goodlooking roofs try it use google search this solar roof is the opposite it will look better and last longer than a normal roof in fact musk seemed almost giddy about the solar roof joyfully embracing this bane of many a homeowners existence and arguing that for far too long weve been deprived of rooftop beauty as a species  and its not hard to see why hes so thrilled on paper solar roof is an enticing product — and something new for tesla the companys vehicles are remarkable but they do currently cost  on average and like all cars are depreciating assets even a tesla is invariably worth less the day after you buy it an appreciating asset i love these damn solar roofstesla the powerwall and the other tesla energy products are potentially a solid line of business but a slab of battery on your garage wall no matter how cool doesnt stir the spirit and like a stove or refrigerator a powerwall will lose value over time the solar roof on the other hand could be financed through a homeowners mortgage adding for the sake of argument  for an effectively year net savings of around  making the roof effectively free if the homes value rises in line with the rate of inflation and the solar roof remains in working order it will become part of an appreciating asset further enhancing the homeowners bottom line and net worth its certainly worth noting that almost no other tech company is in the appreciating asset business apple iphones are from the moment of purchase on a swift path to worthlessness facebooks product is ephemeral google facilitates finding things offering a service rather than something that you can buy that will be worth more later microsoft grew large on software that has to be updated every few years in fact if you look around outside of financial instruments there are really arent that many ways to buy stuff that will actually be worth more tomorrow than today  of course there will be some depreciation with a solar roof and maintenance costs could be a factor but all in when the realestate value of the property is taken into account a homeowner should come out well ahead and the homeowner would have an awesome roof to look at musk is so utterly into the solar roof that he didnt want to let the reporters he spoke with last week go back to work without a message of gorgeous rooftops and free power whats is the future we want he asked we want to look around and see roofs that are beautiful and that draw energy from the sun im

ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and

which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in

investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also previously owned an aero l a czechmade jet trainer aircraft  the  model dassault falcon

over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused

actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also

throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then beat him until he lost consciousness musk was initially educated at private schools attending the englishspeaking waterkloof house preparatory school musk later graduated from pretoria boys high school and moved to canada in june  just before his th birthday after obtaining canadian citizenship through his canadianborn mother education at the age of  musk was accepted into queens university in kingston ontario for undergraduate study in  after spending two years at queens university musk transferred to the university of pennsylvania where in may  he received a bachelor of science degree in physics from its college of arts and sciences and a bachelor of science degree in economics from its wharton school of business musk extended his studies for one year to finish the second bachelors degree while at the university of pennsylvania musk and fellow penn student adeo ressi rented a bedroom fraternity house using it as an unofficial nightclub in  at age  musk moved to california to begin a phd in applied physics and materials science at stanford university but left the program after two days to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the internet renewable energy and outer space in  he became a us citizen career zip main article zip in  musk and his brother kimbal started zip a web software company with us of their fathers money the company developed and marketed an internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry musk obtained contracts with the new york times and the chicago tribune and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with citysearch while at zip musk wanted to become ceo however none of the board members would allow it compaq acquired zip for us million in cash and us million in stock options in february  musk received us million for his  share from the sale xcom and paypal main article paypal in march  musk cofounded xcom an online financial services and email payment company with us million from the sale of zip one year later the company merged with confinity which had a money transfer service called paypal the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in  paypals early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service musk was ousted in october  from his role as ceo although he remained on the board due to disagreements with other company leadership notably over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also previously owned an aero l a czechmade jet trainer aircraft  the  model dassault falcon  aircraft used in the  film thank you for smoking is registered to musk nsx and musk had a cameo as the pilot of his plane opening the door for robert duvall and escorting aaron eckhart aboard musk owns wet nellie the lotus esprit from the james bond film the spy who loved me he plans to convert it into the functional carsubmarine from the film musk attended the burning man festival in  and has said he first thought up the idea for solarcity at the festival tosca musk elons sister is a filmmaker she is the founder of musk entertainment and has produced various movies musk stated that he wants to die on mars just not on impact philanthropy musk is chairman of the musk foundation which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solarpower energy systems in disaster areas in  the musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a kw solar power system to the south bay community alliances sbca hurricane response center in coden alabama in july  the musk foundation donated us towards a solar power project in sōma japan a city that had been recently devastated by tsunami in july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately

over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also previously owned an aero l a czechmade jet trainer aircraft  the  model dassault falcon  aircraft used in the  film thank you for smoking is registered to musk nsx and musk had a cameo as the pilot of

functional carsubmarine from the film musk attended the burning man festival in  and has said he first thought up the idea for solarcity at the festival tosca musk elons sister is a filmmaker she is the founder of musk entertainment and has produced various movies musk stated that he wants to die on mars just not on impact philanthropy musk is chairman of the musk foundation which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solarpower energy systems in disaster areas in  the musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a kw solar power system to the south bay community alliances sbca hurricane response center in coden alabama in july  the musk foundation donated us towards a solar power project in sōma japan a city that had been recently devastated by tsunami in july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity as of  musk is a trustee of the x prize foundation and a signatory of the giving pledge family musk met his first wife canadian author justine wilson while both were students at ontarios queens university they married in  and separated in  their first son nevada alexander musk died of sudden infant death syndrome sids at the age of ten weeks they later had five sons through in vitro fertilization – twins in  followed by triplets in  – all of whom they share custody in  musk began dating english

food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also

philanthropic efforts on providing solarpower energy systems in disaster areas in  the musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a kw solar power system to the south bay community alliances sbca hurricane response center in coden alabama in july  the musk foundation donated us towards a solar power project in sōma japan a city that had been recently devastated by tsunami in july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to

transfer service called paypal the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in  paypals early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service musk was ousted in october  from his role as ceo although he remained on the board due to disagreements with other company leadership notably

food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years

electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also

july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to

transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also

july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to

a battery morgan brennan  morganlbrennan tuesday  mar    pm etcnbccom shares on monday tesla chief executive elon musk took to twitter to tease a new product announcement major new tesla product line—not a car—will be unveiled at our hawthorne design studio on thursday at  pm april  getty images elon musk the tweet fueled a tidal wave of speculation from wall street and news outlets that the mystery product would be a stationary battery storage system for residential customers theres still no firm indication that what musk will debut will be a battery system or anything related to energy for that matter but theres reason to guess that it could be tweet this tesla has confirmed nothing ahead of next months announcement but heres what musk himself said on the electric carmakers february earnings conference call were going to unveil the tesla home battery or the sort of consumer battery that will be for use in peoples houses or businesses fairly soon we have the design done and it should start going to production probably in about six months or so were trying to figure out a date to have the product unveiling but its probably in the next month or two months read moreanalyst keep calm and buy tesla the companys been testing residential stationary batteries in roughly  to  california households according to a global equities research analyst note from monday and it already supplies lithiumion batteries which it also uses in its electric cars to sister company solarcity also founded by musk presumably once teslas  billion lithiumion battery plant—dubbed the gigafactory—gets up and running largescale production could be done from there as well show chapters teslas musk new product coming not a car    monday  mar    pm et   if some sort of battery is indeed the product on tap at aprils event—and with the caveat that the world outside teslas palo alto california headquarters has few details in the meantime—it could become part of a much bigger discussion not only for the future of tesla but for power generation for years now costcompetitive energy storage has persisted as the missing link for renewable energy the main roadblock to more widespread adoption of technologies such as solar photovoltaic panels costeffective storage has been the holy grail of renewable energy for some time said jeffrey osborne a senior research analyst at cowen and co covering alternative energy via email the problem with wind and solar is that it is not dispatchable power to use when you need it and you have to hope the wind is blowing or the sun is shining residential commercial and utilities want storage combined with solar it is just very expensive historically gtm research a market analysis firm that focuses on solar power estimates that the combined market of solarplusstorage could grow to  billion in  up from  million in  its highly likely that tesla intends to play a role in that market morgan stanley published a report last july asserting that from our analysis of the economics of energy storage products we conclude that tesla will likely have the most economic energy storage solution by a significant margin solarcity of which musk is also chairman currently controls  to  percent of the us residential solar market according to cowens osborne and storage represents an opportunity to crosssell more products to customers read moresolar energys unexpected conservative backers that said tesla isnt the company racing to get an attractively priced product onto the storage market earlier this month sunedison announced that it purchased solar grid storage in december sunpower unveiled a partnership with privately held sunverge energy for both residential customers and utilities enphase energy and ideal power are also targeting this space as are startups primus power and enervault mit professor donald sadoway has been developing another kind of stationary storage technology called liquid metal batteries rolling out pilot programs for largerscale use within the grid through ambri a company he started with several former students last fall sadoway told cnbc that widespread deployment of batteries could

is at it again in a classically cryptic tweet to his more than  million followers earlier this week musk teased that a new product announcement was coming on october  what made the tweet even more intriguing is the fact that musk said the new tesla tsla product was unexpected by most musk hinted that the news wont have to do with teslas controversial merger plan with solarcity scty the alternative energy company run by two of musks cousins a separate teslasolarcity event was happening on october  its also unlikely that musk will be talking about his rocket company spacex since he clearly indicated that it was tesla that would have a new product tesla product unveiling on the th unexpected by most followed by teslasolarcity on the th— elon musk elonmusk october   so what does musk have up his sleeve musk is a showman who has been known to oversell his teasing announcements and cnnmoneys auto guru peter valdesdapena doesnt think the news will be all that exciting he told me that its unlikely to be a new vehicle he thinks it could be an updated version of one of teslas existing products or a more detailed look at the upcoming model   the affordable tesla thats due out at the end of  related elon musk wants to sell you an entire solar roof there are rumors that it could be a reworked version of teslas model x suv  a vehicle many are referring to as the model y but twitter users and auto and tech bloggers are hoping it will be much more than that after all musk already has indicated in his new master plan for tesla that a pickup truck heavyduty cargo trucks for freight shipping and some sort of mass transit vehicle could be in the works so maybe a tesla semi or a tesla bus will be the product announcement musk also hinted that tesla will one day let its customers share their cars with other people  ifwhen autonomous driving vehicles get the green light from regulators across the country in other words people could turn their teslas into miniubers and rent them out to people who need a lift or lyft it seems unlikely that tesla will launch a true ridesharing service next week though its probably too soon but one rumor that kept resurfacing this week is that tesla may launch a motorcycle known as the model m the auto blog silodrome even has a mockup of what it could look like it originally posted it last year though not in response to musks latest tweet luckily we only have to wait a few more days to find out just exactly what musk is unveiling some have even joked that it could be a tony starkstyled iron man suit fitting since robert downey jr has said hes modeled his version of the avengers character partly on musk what is certain though is that none of the wacky but hilarious ideas created by the parody bored elon musk twitter account

materials is said to be less than the cost of traditional materials plus electricity major announcement the public first heard of tesla’s intent to acquire solarcity earlier this year despite the fact that the deal hasn’t officially closed both companies are keen to demonstrate the potential of this collaboration this made the most recent announcement which happened yesterday evening something that everyone was really looking forward to image credit tesla motors elon musk has already talked about what could be expected leading up to this big reveal he spoke about creating a new roofing system that could redefine how we use solar power it turns out this will be directly integrated with the powerwall  which will serve as the home energy storage solution this was discussed on the solarcity blog now is the right time to bring our two companies together tesla is getting ready to scale our powerwall and powerpack stationary storage products and solarcity is getting ready to offer nextgeneration differentiated solar solutions by joining forces we can operate more efficiently and fully integrate our products while providing customers with an aesthetically beautiful and simple onestop solar  storage experience one installation one service contract one phone app just this week during tesla’s third quarter earnings call musk shared additional information about the new product describing it as “impressive” and noting that it has exceeded his expectations the goal to replace  million rooftops with tesla’s more sustainable solar alternative tesla roofing system at the event musk was surrounded by houses of many styles all newly fitted with the solar technology the roofing material has been designed to aesthetically match a few different roofing structures such as french slate flat modern and even tuscan style curved roof tiles from the ground the tiles look like the tiles they are mimicking but as they are viewed at a more extreme angle such as that of the sun they become more transparent musk stated “the goal is… to have solar roofs that look better than a normal roof generate electricity last longer have better insulation and actually have an installed cost that is less than a normal roof plus the cost of electricity” photo credit tesla during the unveiling musk also discussed an upgrade to the tesla’s powerwall the powerwall  will cost  and will have double the capacity kwh of the first generation product majority of american homes use asphalt shingles for roofs while cheap its affordability does come at a price they absorb heat and aren’t very durable and in terms of sustainability they are fossil fuel based and are difficult to dispose an affordable environmentally friendly option would indeed be a welcome alternative still the availability of these alternatives including tesla’s new roofing system isn’t an all encompassing solution as musk explained prior to the launch of his latest product the system isn’t designed to be a retrofitted into existing homes it’s designed for anyone constructing new homes or those planning to replace an aging roof other concerns such as the need to install it at “latitudeappropirate angles” or its durability when exposed to harsh elements have also been raised references techcrunch tree hugger solar city written by editor patrick caughill october   editor june javelosa october   share

transfer service called paypal the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in  paypals early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service musk was ousted in october  from his role as ceo although he remained on the board due to disagreements with other company leadership notably over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of

englishspeaking waterkloof house preparatory school musk later graduated from pretoria boys high school and moved to canada in june  just before his th birthday after obtaining canadian citizenship through his canadianborn mother education at the age of  musk was accepted into queens university in kingston ontario for undergraduate study in  after spending two years at queens university musk transferred to the university of pennsylvania where in may  he received a bachelor of science degree in physics from its college of arts and sciences and a bachelor of science degree in economics from its wharton school of business musk extended his studies for one year to finish the second bachelors degree while at the university of pennsylvania musk and fellow penn student adeo ressi rented a bedroom fraternity house using it as an unofficial nightclub in  at age  musk moved to california to begin a phd in applied physics and materials science at stanford university but left the program after two days to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the internet renewable energy and outer space in  he became a us citizen career zip main article zip in  musk and his brother kimbal started zip a web software company with us of their fathers money the company developed and marketed an internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry musk obtained contracts with the new york times and the chicago tribune and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with citysearch while at zip musk wanted to become ceo however none of the board members

march  musk cofounded xcom an online financial services and email payment company with us million from the sale of zip one year later the company merged with confinity which had a money transfer service called paypal the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in  paypals early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service musk was ousted in october  from his role as ceo although he remained on the board due to disagreements with other company leadership notably over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused

nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and

round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
