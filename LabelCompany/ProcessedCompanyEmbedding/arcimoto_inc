public – not just accredited investors – will be able to own equity in arcimoto arcimoto srk fun utility vehicle we set out to create an insanely efficient affordable everyday electric vehicle but it turns out that achieving a black belt in efficiency made the arcimoto srk a ninja in the fun department the critics rave we’ve had journalists from a bevy of littleknown momandpop publications such as forbes bloomberg and wired get behind the handlebars they all agree on at least one thing the srk is a blast to drive more press  arcimoto srk snow day a rare snow day in eugene afforded us the opportunity to take the vehicle out in icy conditions as expected the dual motor front wheel drive and low center of gravity provided great traction arcimoto srk suspension mechanical designer jim jordan has been dialing in the suspension for the signature series here he is to tell you about it while industrial designer collin lafayette gets some testing in the alpha build the only oil we burn around the shop sparingly is the metaphorical midnight variety the team put it in long and focused hours over the first couple weeks of november to get the first alpha prototypes on the road we did a

we finetuned the mule’s electronic and mechanical systems as we assembled the first two generation  alpha product prototypes the arcimoto story arcimoto has been working for  years to redefine the basic pattern of urban mobility this video tells the company story why we exist where we’ve been and the road ahead the big vision in  arcimoto founder mark frohnmayer placed the arcimoto story in the

and the srk eugene’s register guard got a sneak peek at the srk project in advance of our launch founder and president mark frohnmayer answered questions about the company and product and then took reporter kelly lyon for a spin in the arcimoto generation  engineering test mule driving digital trends an odd mixture of utility style and good oldfashioned common sense the gen  model is unlike any car on the road today the vehicle’s small size makes it easy to maneuver — it’s just short enough to park nosein to the curb — and its base range of  miles is more than sufficient for the daily commute of most folks on the verge arcimoto is a company that’s based in eugene oregon where they’ve been making such threewheeled electric vehicles for years each iteration brings improvements better battery life better range and lower weight the company’s newest model known simply as the srk exemplifies that progress ars technica review the srk is an electric trike it’s a twoseater in a tandem configuration with the driver up front steering via handlebars earlier prototypes used a steering wheel—something arcimoto chose to change since it now classifies the srk as a motorbike which have much easier homologation regulations than cars bloomberg means business the future of electric vehicles doesn’t have to look like tesla sedans and faraday future race cars it can be something much simpler and cityfriendly at least that’s what the people behind arcimoto are betting on an electric love child of a commuter’s bicycle and a multiton car—just don’t call it a golf cart kelley blue

invest faq videos press newsletter about events careers contact press kit history since  we’ve designed and built eight generations of vehicle prototypes as part of an iterative vehicle development program aimed at finding a more sustainable more affordable and radically more enjoyable way of getting around on daily trips we recently completed building our first alpha product prototypes and are now touring them on the west coast our mission is simple and you can you see it by standing on any busy street corner and watching the cars go by over and over  lbs of vehicle steel rolls past carrying just one person maybe two ask those folks where they’re going and it could be a mile trip to the store or a mile morning commute tack on fuel and maintenance costs and the expense of wasted resources and energy adds up quickly for the individual and multiplies across the whole of society why haul around thousands of extra pounds of steel and cubic yards of unneeded space for daily commutes a trip to the grocery store or on a movie date it’s time to rightsize our footprint generation  the vision arcimoto’s first prototype an open air model with a configurable rear section generation  is fun to drive and incredibly efficient with space and materials a lack of any protection from the elements and other objects limited the appeal and utility of this concept this was just the beginning of this amazing journey to build the arcimoto srk “the everyday electric” generation  the footprint this prototype generation established a stable and efficient footprint on the road the single occupant is balanced between the three wheels and the vehicle is zippy and fun to drive yet still a significant improvement in environmental efficiency compared to the standard automotive form this second prototype also features a primitive enclosure frame and partial protection from the elements generation  the pulse with a reasonable footprint established the development team began to define the essential characteristics of the first product two seats in tandem a variety of enclosure options established environmentally efficient footprint at the same time the team began building the pulse arcimoto’s rd generation of product development built on the third generation arcimoto platform and constructed with custom bodywork and parts from a recycled yaris the pulse was to highlight using very familiar materials and methods the unique arcimoto platform and company story  arcimoto launched the pulse september rd  generation  the platform for the vast majority of drivers out there – statistically something like  of them the pulse concept actually fit with how they use cars now driving alone to the grocery store for a gallon of milk commuting to school work or the gym going golfing on the weekend after the launch of the pulse arcimoto began the engineering process to turn the concept into an actual marketready product generation  codenamed “darkwing” established and validated a unique new electric vehicle platform prototype  sports a front wheel drive system comfortable ergonomics for two passengers and a very low center of gravity generation  the first srk the team then took all the ideas from the first  generations and brought them together in a single product prototype called the srk launched in spring  generation  was the first blueprint for a market capable vehicle topology but still far from a production ready vehicle the market let us know that the generation  was a couple of key steps closer to the electric vehicle they needed which was affordable allelectric and a blast to drive generation  the first mule after the launch of the first srk the development team began the process of optimizing every aspect of the vehicle architecture we built an improved lower cost drive train made significant reductions in vehicle mass and center of gravity position and built our first lithium chemistry power pack design the team built the generation  prototype mule to validate the enhancements in the design generation  the first pilot generation  was the final arc of the platform development that began after the launch of the pulse what was just a concept vehicle had evolved into a productionintent design arcimoto developed significant technology improvements in the battery packaging system and drive train at the same time the mechanical and industrial design of the platform saw continued refinement this is the vehicle design arcimoto intended to deliver to its first customers generation  full circle late in the generation  build process we conceived a fundamental breakthrough to radically improve yet again the arcimoto product offering lighter weight lower cost better acceleration longer range better ergonomics generation  occupies nearly the same footprint as our very first prototype at the same time it eclipses the capabilities of anything we’ve built before we’re now going full throttle to prove generation  on the road and move expeditiously towards the marketplace preorder   arcimoto inc privacy policy arcimoto world headquarters  blair blvd eugene or  infoarcimotocom    newsletter invest
