knew in  just as reagan was beginning his first term in office the heritage foundation developed a  page detailed policy manual on everything from taxes and regulation to trade and national defense this “mandate for leadership” as it was so titled was described by united press international back then as “a blueprint for grabbing the government by its frayed new deal lapels and shaking out  years of liberal policy” president reagan used “mandate” to help realize his vision of a world free of communism an economy that didn’t crush people’s dreams with high taxes and regulations and an america the world could admire once again he gave copies to every member of his cabinet the result nearly twothirds of “mandate’s”  recommendations were adopted or attempted by the reagan administration now is a time for a new mandate for leadership we have come a long way since reagan—and not in a good way the liberal policies of the obama administration have put a stranglehold on free enterprise new
