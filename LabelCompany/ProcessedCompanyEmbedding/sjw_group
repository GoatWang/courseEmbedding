by nicholas mccullum on june   dividend history is one of the most straightforward and useful ways to determine whether a company has shareholderfriendly management there is remarkable consistency among companies with long histories of steadily rising dividends  meaning that a long dividend increase suggests more increases are yet to come thats why the dividend aristocrats are one of the best places to find highquality dividend growth stocks to be a dividend aristocrat a company must be in the sp  and increase its dividend for  consecutive years you can see the full list of all  dividend aristocrats here the dividend aristocrats have meaningfully outperformed the sp  over long periods of time dividend history matters thus when a company announces its th consecutive annual dividend increase investors ought to take notice sjw group nysesjw recently did just that the companys dividend increase last january qualified it to be a member of the dividend kings  an elite group of stocks with  years of consecutive dividend increases you can see the full list of all  dividend kings analyzed in detail here sjws long streak of dividend increases indicates that it has a defensible competitive advantage and that it is a very shareholderfriendly company this article will analyze the investment prospects of sjw group in detail business overview the sjw group is a water utility company based in san jose california it was founded in  and has a remarkably long corporate history of  years the company has a current market capitalization of  billion more details about sjws investment highlights can be seen below source sjw group investor presentation slide  the sjw group acts as a holding company for its four operating subsidiaries san jose water company sjwtx inc sjw land company texas water alliance limited both the san jose water company and sjwtx inc are water utilities in the traditional sense and deliver water to more than  million customers in aggregate the other subsidiaries operate in unrelated but complimentary industries the sjw land company owns and operates commercial real estate investments conversely the texas water alliance is an entity dedicating to pursuing the development of a regional water supply project in central texas two of these subsidiaries  the san jose water company and sjwtx  are regulated utilities while the other two are nonregulated source sjw group investor presentation slide  moving on the next section will discuss sjws growth prospects in detail growth prospects the sjw groups biggest growth factor is the longterm deprivatization of water infrastructure assets water utilities have traditionally been owned by governmental entities preventing public investors from participating in the upside of this growing industry however government balance sheets are highly leveraged right now and these entities are looking for ways to shed assets and pay down debt this often occurs by selling private assets to publicly traded companies cue the sjw group this company has a tremendous opportunity to acquire highquality assets as governments work to deprivatize their water utility assets more details about the water sector investment thesis can be seen below source sjw group investor presentation slide  sjw is working aggressively to take advantage of this trend financially this can be seen in its capital expenditures the company has grown its capex by an annual rate of  over the past  years indicating that it is well positioned to take advantage of the deprivatization of the water infrastructure industry source sjw group investor presentation slide  competitive advantage and recession resilience the main competitive advantage of the sjw group is the companys ownership of highquality water infrastructure assets this can be seen mostly in its two water utility subsidiaries the san jose water company and sjwtx looking at the first subsidiary it operates  production wells  storage facilities  miles of mains and more than  acres of watershed property the subsidiary also has a diverse customer base with  connections divided into  residential and  commercial customers source sjw group investor presentation slide  the companys sjwtx subsidiary is smaller but has an equally impressive asset base  wells  storage facilities and  miles of mains in addition sjwtx operates  water connections  wastewater connections and is responsible for a  square mile service area source sjw group investor presentation slide  as a water utility the sjw group delivers a product that is critical for human life this suggests the companys performance would be relatively stable in most economic environments we can test this theory by examining its performance during the last recession the companys adjusted earnings per share history during the global financial crisis of  can be seen below  adjusted earnings per share   adjusted earnings per share  a  increase  adjusted earnings per share  a  decrease  adjusted earnings per share  a  increase  adjusted earnings per share  a  increase sjw saw a peaktotrough earnings per share decline of  during the last recession the company managed to remain profitable during the recession but is not as recession resistant as some other healthcare or consumer staples stocks valuation dividends and expected total returns expected total returns for shareholders of the sjw group will come from valuation changes earnings per share growth and the companys current dividend yield after reporting a total shareholder return of  in  and nearly doubling its stock price investors are right to worry about the current valuation of the sjw group fortunately the companys earnings grew significantly during fiscal  while valuation expansion certainly played a large role in the companys returns last year its current pricetoearnings ratio is actually quite reasonable thanks to its proportionate earnings growth source sjw group investor presentation slide  the sjw group reported adjusted earnings per share of  in fiscal  the current stock price of  is trading at a pricetoearnings ratio of  for context the sp  is trading at a pricetoearnings ratio of  right now sjw group is trading at a discount to the rest of the stock market as measured by the sp  index but how does it compare to the typical valuation of this stock the companys current valuation is compared to its longterm historical averages below source value line sjws current valuation is slightly lower than its longterm historical average the company appears to be slightly undervalued especially considering that low interest rates are inflating valuation across the broader stock market thus valuation expansion will likely have a positive effect on the future returns for sjw shareholders turning to earnings per share growth the company has compounded its adjusted earnings per share at an annual rate of  since  its longterm earnings per share trend can be seen below source value line however  annual earnings per share growth for a water utility seems a bit high this number is likely inflated by the strong earnings generated by the company in  s number is expected to be slightly lower i believe a longterm expectation of  earnings per share growth is reasonable for this company the remainder of sjws future shareholder returns will come from its current dividend payments the sjw group currently pays a quarterly dividend of  which yields  at the companys current stock price of  sjws dividend yield is below the sp s average dividend yield of  but will still have a modest positive effect on this stocks longterm total returns also the companys shareholders are all but assured that it will continue raising dividends for many years to come the lindy effect suggests that the sjw group is likely to continue raising its dividend for about another  years to sum up sjws total returns will be composed of  annual earnings per share growth  dividend yield  for expected total returns of  before the likely positive effect of valuation expansion final thoughts the sjw group has many of the characteristics of an appealing dividend invest shareholderfriendly management a lowrisk business model and a very long history of steadily increasing dividend payments and the stock is trading below its longterm average pricetoearnings ratio this is rare in todays market the sjw group merits investment for those looking to secure lowrisk dividend income from a stock that is unlikely to deliver doubledigit total returnsabout this
