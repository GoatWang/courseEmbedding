ahead timothy ring thanks kary i would like to welcome everybody to bard’s fourth quarter of  earnings call and thank all of you for taking the time to join us today i’d expect the presentation portion of the call will last about  minutes we’ve also placed a few slides on the investor relations page of our website to help you understand some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance the agenda today will go as follows i will begin with an overview of the results for the fourth quarter of  john weiland our president and coo will review fourth quarter product line revenues john deford our senior vice presidentscience technology and clinical affairs will give you an update on our product development pipeline and then chris holland our senior vp and cfo will review the forth quarter income statement balance sheet and provide our financial guidance for  and then finally we’ll close with qa so looking at the fourth quarter net sales totaled  million that’s up a  on an as reported basis and up  on a constant currency basis over the fourth quarter of last year which exceeded the guidance we gave you heading into the quarter the currency impact for the quarter versus the prior year was unfavorable by a  basis points on an organic basis we grew  in q we again have provided a summary of these quarterly revenue results in slide  of the deck provided on the website net sales for the fullyear  was  billion that’s up  as reported and up  on a constant currency basis compared to our original guidance last january of  to  constant currency growth for the fullyear when we look at each of the businesses on a constant currency revenue growth basis one business performed near the top of our guidance for the year and the other three all performed above the range we provided with two of those well above the range this brought strength across portfolio contributed to  organic growth for the fullyear compared to our original guidance of  to   was an outstanding year of sales execution for us and we continue to see good momentum and strength across the entire portfolio net income for the fourth quarter was  million and diluted earnings per share were  that’s up  and  respectively excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affected comparability results between periods which chris will cover later fourth quarter  net income and diluted cash earnings per share were  million and  that’s up  and  respectively fullyear  net income was  million diluted earnings per share were  on an adjusted basis fullyear  net income was  million and diluted cash eps were  that’s up  and  respectively as was the case on the revenue line these results significantly exceeded our original guidance for the year despite increasing investments in targeted sales force expansions rd projects in clinical trials throughout the year in advance of our original timelines so we continue to invest significantly for future revenue growth while continuing to provide profitability at very attractive levels looking at q revenue growth geographically compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis net sales in the us grew  and internationally we grew  with europe up  japan up  and our other international geographies up  the performance in japan is due to the sales in q at end customer pricing compared to the prior year when we just acquired our joint venture partner and we were working down inventories that was on the last part of the acquisition as anticipated in our strategic investment plan our emerging market sales continue to improve nicely and represented a  of our total revenue in q this mix is higher by about a  basis points from the prior year even though we saw better than expected growth in the us this year we continue to increase investments in these markets and we believe we are positioning ourselves to provide future returns that will benefit the top and bottom line results of our global portfolio going forward so from our perspective our investments are paying off our organic growth rate is in the top tier of the sector and we continue to invest in a manner that we believe makes that growth sustainable we’ve been able to achieve our objectives while continuing to invest in future growth and absorbing various headwinds along the way so while we are pleased with the execution over the last few years our focus remains solidly on the future we remain in investment mode our intention is to make a strong organic engine that can help us navigate through the coming years with attractive revenue growth margin profile and profitability now with that as a summary let me turn you over to john weiland for a review of our fourth quarter product line revenues john weiland good evening everyone before i start as usual i’ll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted also there are three product lines that we have been discussing historically that now each represent too small of a percentage of our business to warrant calling out here so this will be the last quarter that we discuss growth rates in vena cava filters brachytherapy and performance irrigation so let’s start with vascular total net sales in this category for the quarter were  million that’s up  on a reported basis and  on a constant currency basis over the fourth quarter of  excluding the ep divestiture core royalty and japan sales global vascular sales were still up  with the united states business up  for the quarter and international up  sales in our vascular graft category were down  in the fourth quarter driven by lumpiness in oem orders q  saw a spike in oem orders while this quarter saw the opposite we don’t believe there is anything behind this other than the sporadic nature of orders from these customers excluding the gore royalty our endovascular business grew  in the fourth quarter within endovascular our biopsy line was up  the seven straight doubledigit quarter globally driven by strength in emerging markets our peripheral pga products were up  this quarter driven by very strong growth from our lutonix drugcoated balloon our stent business was up  in the fourth quarter we benefited from the launch of lifestent in japan and doubledigit growth in the rest of international and also saw a growth above the recent trend in the united states and to complete the category sales in our vena cava filter line were up  in q compared to the prior year when we had a supplier component issue now let’s move to urology total net sales were  million which is up  versus the fourth quarter of last year on an as reported basis and up  on a constant currency basis excluding japan and liberator global growth was  with the united states up  and international up  fairly consistent with recent quarters the targeted temperature management products grew  this quarter returning to doubledigit growth both domestically and internationally as we predicted last quarter our basic drainage business was up  in q globally excluding liberator and japan basic drainage was up  in the united states with ic pulleys down  globally and down  in the united states due to an exceptionally high comp in the prior year we continue to see relative stability in the underlying volume trend for this product line our incontinence business was up  virtually all driven from liberator and japan sales in urological specialties were up  with our brachytherapy product down  and sales from our statlock catheter stabilization line were flat this quarter now let’s move to oncology total net sales in this category were  million up  to q last year on an as reported basis and  on a constant currency basis excluding japan global sales were up  with the united states being up  and international sales up  our port line was up  versus q of last year you may remember that we had timing issues timing issues and emerging market orders of ports between q of  and the first quarter of  so this quarter is up against a very easy comp and next quarter will be the opposite ports also represent the majority of our oncology business in japan so this product line is benefiting from moving to end customer pricing picc revenue growth was  in the fourth quarter with continued strength outside of the united states our vascular access ultrasound product line was up  this quarter and our dialysis catheter business was up  in the fourth quarter and we’ll finish with surgical specialties net sales in this category were  million in the fourth quarter up  on an as reported basis and  on a constant currency basis excluding japan global sales were up  with the us up  and international sales up  our biosurgical product portfolio grew  in the fourth quarter our soft tissue repairing business grew  overall in the fourth quarter within that subtotal our total synthetic hernia products were up  this quarter while our natural tissue products decreased  consistent with recent trends our fixation business grew  in the fourth quarter demonstrating continued strength from new products introduced a year ago in closing out the surgical category our performance irrigation business was down  this quarter this concludes our product line revenue discussion i will now turn you over to john deford john deford thank you john and good afternoon everyone i’ll jump right into a brief discussion of a few of our highlighted pipeline products i’ll start with our drugcoated balloons first our long lesion and instent restenosis supplements are under reviewed at fda and we’re hopeful for approval of both of these expanded indications in the nearterm month results from our randomized isr and international long lesion studies were presented at linc this week and both studies confirmed the lutonix dcb as an important therapeutic option for these additional patient populations with complex sfa and popliteal disease in our below the knee ide we continue to enroll and believe the recently approved protocol change to support the primary endpoint analysis at six months could put our pma approval in late  an initial look at our global btk registry results were presented this week at linc showing  freedom from tlr at six months the av access dcb ide study reached the sixmonth followup on all enrolled patients today at linc dr scott trerotola presented the first look at the primary results the largescale multicenter trial is the first study designed to evaluate target lesion primary patency in av fistula the number of interventions required to maintain target lesion patency and safety endpoints over time dr trerotola presented results through eight months but demonstrates sustained clinical benefit of the lutonix dcb over pta in multiple locations in the av access circuit the presentation is on the ir section of our website for your convenience the last module of the av pma was submitted to fda this week on january  at this time we anticipate approval around year end in japan our indiscernible submission for the lutonix sfa indication remains under review while in china we continue to enroll in our levant china study that began about a year ago also in vascular our lifestream balloon expandable coverage stent pma is under review at fda and we continue to anticipate approval and launch about midyear our covera nextgeneration av access circuit stent graft studies continue to enroll on schedule we’re evaluating this technology in both fistula only and graft only studies both studies began enrollment in q of  and we expect enrollment will continue into q of this year our venovo vena stent ide study is an active recruitment and we continue to receive positive feedback from europe where the product is commercially available and was featured in several presentations and a live case at linc we anticipate enrollment will be completed in the firsthalf of this year with followup in pma submission in  our lifestent  french platform is on track to launch in the eu midyear with a clinical study to support us approval expected to start around the same time now moving to urology we expect our first patient to be enrolled any day now in the new ide study of our targeted temperature management technology and the prevention and control of neurogenic fever this study will evaluate the use of the arctic sun system in this new potential indication and we plan to enroll more than a  patients moving to oncology we received  k clearance and began the rollout of our new provena family of powerpiccs that were developed based on nursing guidelines and clinical literature supporting the use of smaller diameter catheters to reduce the risk of thrombosis and other complication we’ve begun the launch of our  french duallumen and  french singlelumen powerpiccs to round out our size offering and complement our recently launched  french triplelumen version our solo valve family of provena powerpiccs will be a quick followup to these launches expected around midyear the new provena family provides the same flow rates and performance of our standard powerpiccs but are a full french size smaller we’re also preparing for the launch of new configurations of our popular power midline and powerglide pro families of intermediate dual catheters including a dual lumen version of the power midline we expect full launch by the end of the first quarter we’re also launching the nextgeneration nautilus delta system with specific indications for tip confirmation for the pediatric patient for piccs ports and central lines here in the us training of our sales team just took place and the rollout has started in tandem we’re launching a new picc tray with small components to provide venous access for this important patient population i’ll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery first in biosurgery we expect to launch the new tridyne aortic sealant in q of this year and our progel emerald lung sealant launch is also expected to take place in q progel emerald is designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery in hernia repair we launched an additional  sizes and configurations of our phasix resorbable mesh in late q these new sizes were well received at the latest american college of surgeons meeting in october the unique phasix design is now available in the broadest range of sizes and configurations in the industry phasix  and month clinical data will be presented at the upcoming american hernia society and sages meetings in march expansion of our xenmatrix ab platform with multiple new sizes is also on track for launch later this quarter we’ve received  k clearance in late december and we’re building inventory to support demand after launch bard will offer the largest biologically derived graft in the market similarly clinical data on xen ab in complex hernia repair was published in october of  that showed both low recurrence and low infection rates in this difficult patient population and finally in mesh fixation we’re continuing the rollout of our new  count version of the optifix resorbable fixation device with further launches in this category expected in the firsthalf of the year this completes the pipeline update i appreciate your attention as we covered a lot of ground let me turn you over to chris christopher holland thank you john and good afternoon everyone let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods we had a benefit from acquisitionrelated items of  million pretax a  million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives and a  million pretax charge for product liability these items are all detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our q earnings press release now let’s go to the statement of income for the fourth quarter gross profit was  million in q or  of sales on an adjusted basis gross profit was  million or  of sales that’s down  basis points from the prior year with fx about a  basis point headwind in the quarter pricing pressure was about  basis of – points of headwind on the revenue line and about  basis points in gp in q mix was flat in the quarter due to the anniversary of the medicon acquisition and cost improvements and other items drove about  basis points of favorability for the quarter for the fullyear  that brings adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales to  that’s up a  basis points from  which exceeded our original guidance for the year sga expenses were  million for the quarter or  of sales on an adjusted basis sga was  million or  of sales that’s down  basis points from the prior year driven by the anniversary of the medicon acquisition as well as the suspension of the medical device excise tax for the fullyear  adjusted sga as a percentage of sales was  an increase of  basis points over the prior year this was consistent with our original guidance for the year despite accelerating some additional investment spending in the backhalf of the year because of our strong operating performance rd expenditures totaled  million for the fourth quarter or  of sales on an adjusted basis rd expense was  million or  of sales an increase of  basis points from the prior year period as we had projected a higher level of spend due to investments for both the quarter and the fullyear for the fullyear  on an adjusted basis rd expense was  of sales an increase of  basis points over  interest expense was  million for the fourth quarter and  million for the fullyear other income and expense was  million of expense for the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis it was  million of income for the quarter and  million of income for the year the effective tax rate for the quarter was  on an adjusted basis it was  taken us to  for the fullyear which was about  basis points below the bottom end of our guidance range that we provided at the beginning in  that all adds up to eps of  for q excluding amortization of intangibles and items affecting comparability bringing us in at  for the fullyear on that same basis that’s  above the highend of our original guidance for the year despite having increased investments during the course of the year indicative of the strong operating performance we saw throughout  we repurchased about  shares of the company’s stock in q taking the total buybacks in  to approximately  million shares at an average price of  the balance sheet as of december  reflects cash restricted cash and shortterm investments of  billion versus  billion at september  also compared to q our ar days were up  days and our inventory days were down  days capital expenditures totaled  million for the quarter and  million for the year on the liability side total debt was  billion as of december  that’s no change from september  and debt to total capital at the end of the fourth quarter was about  and total shareholder investment was  billion at december   so with the strong  now on the books let’s turn to financial guidance for  excluding amortization of intangibles and the impact of items that affect the comparability the revenue we project  constant currency and organic revenue growth in the  to  range as always our expectations assume no change in the market growth rates from where they have been and we don’t ever include future acquisitions in our financial guidance we estimate that our current rates we’re looking at a revenue headwind related to currency of between  and  which would put our reported revenue growth guidance for  between  and  as far as constant currency revenue growth in our four disease state categories in  we expect vascular revenue growth to be between  and  urology to be between  and  oncology to grow between  and  and our surgical specialties business to grow between  and  we expect our overall gross margin percent to be between  and  in  which would be up  to  basis points compared to  we had strong gp tailwinds from mix in  due to the movements and customer pricing in japan that becomes a tough comp for us in  but we still expect the mix to be favorable by  to  basis points this year we expect fx to be between  and  basis points of negative pressure based on current rates we’re prepared for continued pricing pressure in the range of  to  basis points on the revenue line and between  and  basis points to gross margin our cost improvement programs continue to help offset the negative pressures from price and fx and are projected to contribute about  basis points of benefit to gps in  we expect sga as a percentage of sales to be between  and  in  representing a decrease of  to  basis points despite significant investments in selling resources in fact we’re adding more than  customerfacing reps and clinical specialists across the globe in  with about half of those in emerging markets so while we increase resources in the areas of strong growth opportunity we are seeing the leverage from higher sales and from the continued integration of our recent acquisitions we expect rd as a percentage of sales to be in the mid range or even a bit higher this year as a side note here we will put – that will put our rd expense at about  million on an adjusted basis for  compared to less than  million in  just prior to our investment plan we project our operating margin in  to be between  and  which is an improvement of  to  basis points compared to  despite our planned increased investment in selling resources and rd investments discussed earlier we expect interest expense in  to be in the low  million range reflecting the fullyear impact of our bond offering that we completed in may of  we expect the effective tax rate to be between  and  in  the change from  being driven by the new accounting treatment for excess tax benefit from stock plans just to be clear apart from the accounting change we have assumed no change in us tax policy for our  guidance all of that adds up to adjusted cash eps for  excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affect comparability between  and  representing  to  growth over  this guidance includes a projected negative currency impact of about  based on today’s rates it also includes a projected benefit of  to  from the new accounting treatment for excess tax benefits from stock plans that range is wide intentionally because we do not control the key variables that drive that calculation we will certainly be transparent with you on the impact of this item as we move through the course of the year as for capital expenditures we expect  to be in a  million range and we expect operating cash flow to be in the  million range excluding the impact of product liability payments as we enter  we continue to be in investment mode we are as focused on the revenue growth and profitability of the company in  as we are on  we believe that our continued investments will sustain a strong organic engine as we move forward providing a differentiated growth profile from the sector at large and driving attractive returns for our shareholders for q we expect constant currency sales growth between  and  and reported revenue growth between  and  we expect adjusted cash eps in q to be between  and  as you may remember we called out several onetime positive benefits on the sales line last year in q and the new acquisitions provided a big tailwind to gross margins a year ago those items now become headwinds in q in  but we have a tailwind from some remaining benefit from japan that partially offset the sales headwind and with divesting of our benefit plans heavily weighted in q we estimate that the excess tax benefit could contribute as much as  or even a little more to eps in q so these tailwinds help offset the income headwinds in the quarter and allow us to guide adjusted cash eps growth of a  to  for q finally as we begin  we remain confident in our plans and intensely focused on execution the objectives of our efforts are clear creating sustained value for patients our customers our employees and our shareholders thank you for your attention and with that i’ll turn the call back to tim timothy ring thank you chris while we’re pleased with our performance in  we remain extremely focused on the growth opportunities in front of us and are executing against them we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the coming quarters and that does concludes the formal part of the presentation i’ll now turn the call back to the moderator to facilitate qa questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we’ll now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from david lewis from morgan stanley please go ahead david lewis good afternoon a few quick questions maybe two so congratulations on the quarter and obviously the guide but tim maybe just start off i think this is a much more bullish guide that i think investors are used to seeing out of bard and i’m wondering if you could sort of comment generally on some of the factors that are providing that level of confidence as you head into  timothy ring yes i don’t know about the first part of your comment so i won’t respond to that but relative to the guidance we did give we feel good about the momentum in the business we continue to achieve or by business almost beat sales objectives that we set last year when that overachievement happened as you know we controlled expenses pretty tightly here that allows us to continue to invest in the business in the growth areas and that’s a model we’ve been running for long time and with good execution we’re able to invest even more so we’ve got a lot of momentum right now david lewis okay maybe just two quick followups one for john deford av access stated this morning i wonder just given the clinical value that the pi talked about this morning as well as the system label extension i wonder if the av access approval could come earlier and maybe you could update us on your commercial strategies specifically as it relates to reimbursement and maybe just one more for tim and i’ll jump back in queue just tim on balance sheet activity i think in    it hasn’t been as robust as  through  and i just wondered if you could comment on whether that’s asset quality numbers valuation thank you timothy ring i’ll take the last one first then turn it over to john so nothing changed basically in the landscape environment acquisitions they are opportunistic we don’t control the timing all the time i wouldn’t say there’s anything notably different relative to valuations or anything else from what has been around over the last couple of years john deford okay and then just jumping in on the av access data it was a pretty exciting day for us as far as timing of the pma and approval as i said we’ve submitted our final module i just went in this week however we don’t really control the timing this is really in fda’s hands and so while the submission is under review we think the timeline is probably with a typical of roughly day review cycle so that’s why we put it in the backhalf of the year and later in the year obviously we would love to see it come sooner but we don’t really have much control over that on the reimbursement side the inpatient and hospital patient there is additional reimbursement in the officebased lab there is not specific reimbursement for drugcoated balloon since there’s not a product that’s been out there for that indication so we’ve got a plan to work on that there’s a – it’s a little bit different in that it’s not the same kind of open public process that you see for hospital inpatient or outpatient for that matter so our reimbursement team is working on that we think we’ve got a plan to get that in place as soon as possible but obviously we’ll hit the market without that for the opl operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen due to the large number of investors expected on the call management request that you limit your number of questions to one with a brief followup if you have additional questions you may reenter the queue and now to line of larry biegelsen from wells fargo please go ahead larry biegelsen good afternoon thanks for taking the question just wanted to start with the strength in vascular with the exception of surgical graft everything was above recent trend so can you talk about the sustainability there and then just for my followup you are forecasting a deceleration in surgical in  versus  could you comment a little bit on that thanks for taking the questions timothy ring i’ll take the first part and then we’ll comment on the second it was an excellent quarter for us in vascular and i think the strength of it was based on biopsy in general up  really great execution in emerging markets with our biopsy products continued great penetration with drugcoated balloons around the globe vena cava filters up  that was a comp issue more than anything else as we were having component problems last year getting supply that finally cleared up in the first quarter and then we had a very good stent quarter up  and that was driven by some new product launches that we had around the globe as it relates to surgical specialties we think that the difference in what were forecasted in surgical specialties is just purely based on the concept we’re up against in that business our new product launches have been significant they continue to take a very large number of share points in that category versus competitors but we are up against tougher comps in  than we were in  operator thank you and now to the line of mike weinstein from jpmorgan please go ahead michael weinstein thank you i may try and sneak a couple in it sounds like we have an aggressive operator so i may try and be a little bit sneaky guys so my first question is chris just on the eps guidance is the way we should think about it is basically you guided to  to  eps growth ex the accounting change for the stock benefits that’s kind of one and then two the cash flow guidance was a little bit lower than i was modeling and it may just be our model but could you give us the  cash flow numbers and if you have any insights there that would be great christopher holland sure yes the operational number is  to  mike and there’s a couple of kind of nonoperational items negatively impacting that amortization is not growing at all just given the level of ma in  and interest expense and headwind as well so that we feel really good about the number and it reflects the investments that we spoke about that were continuing to put into the organization globally cash flow again  million or so when you exclude the product liability payments that roll through there that’s compared to on a likeforlike basis in  up about  million so we can talk afterwards offline but we’re generating very strong free cash flow and obviously and what i really like about the model is we exit  and go into  with a ton of optionality still reflected in the balance sheet as well with all of this growth and operating performance coming organically at this point so it’s a good place to be and again continue to grow free cash flow at healthy rates and we expect to do so in  michael weinstein okay can i speak in a followup christopher holland go ahead mike michael weinstein okay thanks so john deford does the – i understand that the sixmonth primary patency endpoint this morning wasn’t met but that obviously became statistically significant at eight months do you think that matters at all to the fda i totally don’t think it will matter to the marketing of the product but a do you think that matters to the fda and then just the b there was lots of puts and takes for the  outlook versus what we were expecting i think the one business that where you are more optimistic or more aggressive in the forecast than us was vascular i was hoping you could shed some insight is that lutonix is that something else any insight there would be appreciated thanks john deford all right thanks mike for the question after some inquiries late in the day sparked by a call from what we’ve been told maybe a competitor i was hoping for the opportunity to address the question so i appreciate bring it up as i stated in the prepared remarks this is the first study in history with levelone evidence to show a significant improvement in stenosis treatment for the av fistula patient it’s a very valuable and very vulnerable patient population whose very lives depend on the ability to gain high flow access for hemodialysis and though the study didn’t achieve statistical significance at this arbitrary time point of  days the results reached statistical significance at the end of the sixmonth followup window and that significance grows through all time points and data we’ve seen so far dr trerotola presented data through  days with  fewer interventions and a  improvement in patency and so the excitement we’ve already received from the clinical community that treats these patients and has had the opportunity to see the results is amazing however i think there is cause for concern if a competitor or anyone for that matter kind of stirs up noise on a technicality when the benefits to patients is so clear and as you know we’re completely focused on helping these and all the patients that bard’s products serve i frankly wish other companies in this space would keep that focus in mindset too timothy ring and mike just as it relates to vascular i think there’s momentum in a number of categories there john highlighted biopsy the biopsy business in china continues to really excite us we think we’ve got a long runway there so we’re excited about that in  and just following on john deford’s comments the the lutonix portfolio for us continues to be very exciting obviously we expect the av approval later in the year that will certainly we think be significant and helpful both to the end of  and also position us very nicely moving into  lifestent launched in japan that will continue to drive some good growth in japan in vascular as well so there’s a couple of different areas within the portfolio that make us confident with the range that we’re now providing for  operator thank you and now to the line of amit hazan from citigroup please go ahead amit hazan great thank good afternoon guys maybe i could start with oncology the – so the guidance of  to  for the year i don’t know if you’re just being conservative there it’s a bit lower than your trend obviously for last year which was very good maybe just give us a little bit of thoughts on what’s kind of behind that guidance for the year timothy ring yes amit i think that that franchise continues to be globally our most significant opportunity we’re continuing to see terrific growth in many markets around the world obviously we’re continuing to maintain and take share in the us market that’s obviously much more mature on the picc side and we’re seeing very significant growth within our mid line franchise that maybe to a certain degree is cannibalizing picc utilization in certain instances so we feel good about the franchise we think we’ve still got a long runway of growth globally and in general we never get ahead of ourselves and we’re not going to do that going into  but feel good about some of the new product launches the provena family of new piccs we think is significant and we’re continuing to lead in innovation and continuing to frankly distance ourselves from our competitive set across the board amit hazan great and let me just come back maybe to the dcb market for my followup so your competitor talks about this market recently as kind of a mid growing market which seemed to me to be actually a little bit low just given where we are in that market set i wondered if you could just comment on whether you agreed on that growth for the market and what you would expect for the coming year if you could accelerate or decelerate from here and any market share thoughts that you usually kind of give us on these calls would be great timothy ring yes i think we would probably see it at least listen we know what we’re doing and we see growth higher than that frankly as we sit here today and look at our results for q so again we know the data we get and we know our results and we’re continuing to see very strong momentum and obviously what we love about our positioning from here forward is we’ve got leadership and the followon indications that are going to be critical to continue to expand that market obviously av later this year and we’re the only one with the btk trial that’s enrolling and we’re continuing to make significant progress there as well so the franchise that bard in dcbs we think is unique and positions us we think in a way that makes us very exciting from growth in    and  and the teams are focused on executing against all of those followon indications operator all right thank you and now to the line of larry keusch from raymond james please go ahead larry keusch thanks good evening i guess for tim and john weiland so it wasn’t lost on me that emerging markets are – were  of sales in the fourth quarter despite some very strong us growth so very impressive i’m wondering if you can sort of help us understand perhaps what regions is really driving the growth i guess weaved into this question is latin america had seen a recovery in the third quarter if that’s – how that’s doing and then any thoughts around china and the productivity of the sales force and i guess the followon quickly is ex – for chris exasu  sort of what’s the underlying tax rate that you’re using in your guidance timothy ring yes let me answer the first part i think you’re seeing excellent execution in all the emerging markets right now china latin america solid growth in the european emerging markets and in the rest of asia where we’re making significant investments in terms of sales footprints you may know that we’ve increased our sales forces worldwide by over  in the last three years and i think that our comments on adding an  more people in sales and clinical specialists in  shows you we’ll continue to run the same playbook in terms of expansion of our footprint excellent training of clinicians and the resulting sales force growth i think that you’ll see that continued focus on  and in the future we like what our productivity is in these markets we like the uptake of our sales team and we’re optimistic that we will continue to drive excellent growth for us in those spaces christopher holland and larry on the tax rate the lower rate that we’re guiding in  the reductions virtually all from the adoption of the accounting standard so absent that we would be roughly flat to  that we reported for the fullyear  larry keusch okay great thank you christopher holland you’re welcome operator thank you and now to line of brooks west from piper jaffray please go ahead sir brooks west thank you and thanks for taking the questions tim i want to start big picture with you on the political discussion around the aca repeal and also the import – potential import tax i’m wondering how you are seeing potential impacts on your business and then also as you talk to hospital ceos i just wondered if you are seeing any hesitancy whether it’s on spending or volumes any comments there would be appreciated timothy ring sure i don’t have any more of a crystal ball into what’s going on than anybody else so i think the way i would characterize any aca change for us coming out of an end of an aca wind down it’s kind of the same way we thought about it going in we were told there were  million uninsured people in the us and the device industry was going to get a wind fall and as a result we were forced to pay a  tax to pay for that well that didn’t happen we didn’t get the wind fall and the other assumption was we would be able to pass down to our customers and that didn’t happen so we didn’t notice a big increase at all really in our volumes on the way in i don’t think we’re going to see one on the way up in fact we’ve got data we discussed before we think healthcare spending correlates much tighter on unemployment rates and the economy than necessarily to this kind of policy change so maybe more importantly than that insight is what our customers feel and think and depending we’ve talked to the various level of concern but i would say to their credit almost everyone i’ve seen focuses first and foremost on improving patient care quality and their efficiencies and the other policy decisions will fall off and they’ll manage around those just like we will on our sector of business so that that’s my take on the aca not very insightful frankly i’m sure but… brooks west okay timothy ring i’ll let chris answer the border tax question christopher holland yes sure larry i mean the border adjustment concept is one that we’re going to need a lot more detail as i think everybody will to really dial that down we certainly had a higher level think it’s neutral to positive for us given our footprint but there’s a bunch of complexities within our supply chain and others that the details really are going to drive the impact i like to use the example of lutonix since we manufacture those balloons in ireland and then coat them at one of our plants in the us and then sterilize and export them from the us as well so we need to get more specifics around that policy but at a high level certainly from a rate standpoint and based on the modeling we can do on a border adjustment component of a new tax plan we think it’s a win for bard but it’s hard for me to say more than that without having some details that we can be a little bit more specific with brooks west thanks and then one quick followup for me chris it is brooks not larry christopher holland sorry brooks west don’t call me larry yes just on the size of the dcb market i’m wondering if you could update us just on your thoughts on the potential size and then just any framework you can get us around the size as some of these incremental market you’re talking about av fistula or long lesion or isr any updated thoughts that would be helpful thanks christopher holland yes i think on the sfa side which includes – it certainly includes isr and the long lesion as well which as john said we’re hopeful for very nearterm approvals there we continue to – as we look out to the  timeframe see that globally at about  million or so in total the av access when we talked about this over the last number of quarters the deeper we get into that opportunity the more and more excited we are and to john deford’s comment the clinical community’s reaction to this data really is validating that just in terms of how difficult this patient population is and how desperate they are for some better alternatives so we’ve talked about that being in a  million to  million opportunity for us and then obviously the below the knee opportunity we’ve talked about that in the  million range or so when we look out a few years as well so i don’t think other than continuing to get more bullish on av i don’t think we have changed our view to how we see those markets develop and what the ultimate sizes of the market brooks west thanks so much christopher holland i’m sorry for calling you larry brooks operator all right thank you and now to the line of vijay kumar from evercore please go ahead vijay kumar hey guys congrats on a nice quarter so maybe i will start with the previous question on the av access would it i’m just curious would it matter to the fda or from a clinical perspective whether significance was reached at  or  days and as a followup i think you mentioned about how there were fewer interventions excuse me in the dcb arm have you done any sort of economic studies or economic analysis i mean it seems to be meaningful a third less of your interventions in the dcb arm john deford yes john deford here so let me try to jump in again the study design was selected and although no study like this has ever been done before so it’s a bit of a picking out of the air what we thought was the right timing and the great thing that we saw was this continued separation that starts at about  to  days and then just gets wider over time it’s actually kind of statistically interesting to see the day mark where it does look like a little bit of a blip that then begins to separate further fda’s view of that they’ve got this now in their hands to take a look at i’m not certainly not going to speak on their behalf but based on what we’ve seen and the importance of this to patients and then the continued benefit over time and then the other thing we still got mountains of data to pour through here but so far the look is this is a really clean study so i think some questions that have been raised in some of our previous pivotal study things like subgroups and that kind of stuff we don’t believe are issues in this study which support what we’ve always believed about the technology so i think in total this is really pretty compelling information and compelling data as they share today dr trerotola shared our most recent look at the data  days but technically we reached statistical significance at the end of the sixmonth followup so  days after the day followup when all those patients that were day followup patients were viewed we reached some significance at that point so again we think a little bit interesting the way that the study came out we think the results are pretty compelling and we’re excited about it and the clinical community is too now let me just jump quickly to the question about the health economics or the economic value of this we haven’t completed that analysis although just as you pointed out there’s such a clear difference in intervention rates and those interventions are at significant expensive and not only expensive in dollars or euros or any other currency but they’re really expensive and human quality alive and so we think as we pull that together there’s going to be a pretty compelling story there too on health economics or the economic value of this improvement vijay kumar gotcha that was helpful and maybe one quick one for chris it looks like the guidance implies sort of flattish gross margins if you will i mean you literally had six straight years of nice gross margin and now progression so maybe could you just talk about some moving parts in the gross margin line chris thank you christopher holland yes sure and we’re guiding  to  basis points of improvement vijay so we do expect to continue to grind the gross margins high certainly again  benefited from the acquisition in japan in a very significant way as we moved to end customer pricing plus got the benefit as we sold down inventory and effectively got dollars without any additional cost as well and so we feel good about approaching  gross margins that’s the highend of our guidance for  our operations team is continuing to deliver while making sure that we’ll continue to make the right investments there to make that sustainable fx and price continue to be headwinds and we’re being a little bit cautious on price in  we obviously did better than we thought in  and that up about  basis points of gross margin headwind in  and we’re guiding  to  in  so  to  basis points of improvement we feel good about and it’s a critical component of the operating model and that helps us again commit to  to  basis points of operating margin improvement in  so i wouldn’t take anything from the fact that it’s somewhat below recent trend which was really driven by japan vijay kumar thanks guys i’ll step back in the queue christopher holland sure hey kary we are at the top of the hour we’re going to take two more analysts and then we’ll have to cut it up after that i apologize to those that were not going to get to and i’ll be around this evening to catch up with any questions you have operator all right and now we go to line of bob hopkins from bank of america please go ahead bob hopkins well thanks and good afternoon can you hear me okay timothy ring yes hey bob bob hopkins great good afternoon congrats on a great  i just wanted to followup with one other question on av access and i will be direct i just what i’m curious about is at the time that you expect approval kind of what potential – at what percentage of the potential customer base do you think will have adequate reimbursement john weiland yes i think bob we don’t have perfect data on that but it’s probably in the  to  range is some of the data that i’ve seen bob hopkins okay and then how long do you think it will take either for chris or john to the process of gaining incremental reimbursement for the – for those that won’t have it initially how long would you think that will take christopher holland that’s a little hard to be specific as john deford mentioned that it’s not a prescriptive process there so we’re working with the clinical community which really takes the lead in driving ovlrelated decisions so we’d rather not predict the time but the team is working diligently to make sure that it’s close to approval as possible i do think to john’s point the economic proposition to the system and the proposition to the patient are really compelling and so with the full hearing of all the benefits here we’re optimistic that this moves as quickly as it practically can but unfortunately there’s not a prescriptive timeline we can… john weiland right and to chris’s point one of the positives though is that we were able to get the data out today that was a real milestone for us to be able to then get this into the hands of societies and key opinion leaders and members of the rock and other – some of the other stakeholders that interact with cms so rest assured we’re working that process the best we can but as chris said it’s just not a very prescriptive process and certainly not one that we can interject ourselves directly into but certainly can we – we can provide as much data as we can timothy ring and bob i would just point out that when we launched sfa in october of  we didn’t have any reimbursement anywhere we got outpatient in april right so that much later and then we didn’t get hospital inpatient until a fullyear after and as you know there was a lot of usage during those months so – and so we had a better starting point with av than we were with sfa and there’s a lot of demand for it bob hopkins those are great points thank you tim just one real quickly for you decelerating growth as you saw pretty much all year long and in the fourth quarter obviously a lot of that is due to your rd investments in bard but could you just comment on what you are seeing more broadly in the market do you think there is also just some broader market acceleration in surgical procedure volumes going on here or is this primarily bard timothy ring well i mean we’re picking up share we’re growing faster than the market i mean we don’t obviously have fourth quarter market growth projection yet but our i think our third quarter sector market growth rate was like  something like that so that’s one data point referencing the earlier comment i made about environment change we do think there’s a very strong correlation between unemployment rates and healthcare spend so there’s a study not only in the us but a study done i think at the end of  that looked at  oecb countries regardless of healthcare spending they are all spending kind of dipped during the recession and starting in the last year it has come back up so i think that’s what we’re seeing but we kind of saw the market through third quarter  percentageish we’ll see what the fourth quarter tell us bob hopkins fair enough thanks guys timothy ring you’re welcome thanks bob operator thank you and our final question today comes from dave turkaly from jmp securities please go ahead david turkaly thanks and on the dcp market side as we have had some conversations with folks have actually indicated that they think that av access is going to turn out to be larger than btk but that  million i think estimate that you have put out there i’m just curious if you’ve commented at all and sort of how many balloons you think could be used in those procedures again we’ve had some conversations where people have brought up that it could be significantly higher than what you’re seeing today so any color there would be great christopher holland sure so i’ll try to take that question in the study we typically only – well we only treated one lesion and so and the balloons are sized such that that they’ll do that however we did see a significant number of patients that had more than one lesion and if you remember from some of the discussion on the inclusion and exclusion criteria the inclusion criteria allow that as long as they were successfully treated in those other lesions so we agree we think that if you kind of look at our study i think we ended up somewhere around  to  lesions per patient when you include those others and so if you kind of extrapolate that you could maybe argue that maybe you’d use  balloons per patient sort of on average but it’s a little bit hard to say as you said i think there’s a certainly a big need here and in the whole av access circuit there’s the opportunity for treatment into a number of areas as these patients don’t always just get the stenosis at the anastomosis but also downstream in the venous system so we’ll be looking to quantify that a little bit better over time david turkaly great and as a followup not that this would be a bad thing given the momentum and the solid results but i guess for tim is it kind of fair to say that investment mode is sort of the new goforward mode for bard timothy ring well it is not new frankly we – actually the process we used to turn on incremental investment side of the pl is more over and above what we put in the budgets we’ve been running that quite literally for  years so the amounts vary based on how well we perform and when we execute well we are able to invest more and that process also allows us to have a standing queue of kind of ready investments so it’s not like we have to ring the bell and tell everybody to go get ideas we have idea flow constantly through this place david turkaly thank you thank you and that does conclude our qa session i’d now like to turn the call back over to bard’s management for closing or additional comments timothy ring great thank you and i’d like to thank everybody for joining us today i’d also like to take this opportunity to thank bard’s employees around the world for another very strong year of execution for their dedication and commitment to the company so
