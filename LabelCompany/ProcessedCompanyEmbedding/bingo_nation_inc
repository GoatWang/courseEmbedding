customers in the united states address  east sunset roadsuite las vegas nv united states phone  website wwwbingonationtv bingo nation otcblto  the worlds first and only publicly traded indian gaming company new supergrowth company bingo nation otc blto set to deliver  gains by years end the worlds first and only publicly traded indian gaming company shares of bingo nation otcblto could rise  this year as it installs  bingo kiosks across tribal lands  generating  million per week in revenue if you want to profit you need to take a look at this stock right now  before it announces its next quarterly earnings statement bingo nation inc otc blto the house always wins thats why gambling companies are such safe bets the gambling industry is projected to grow  a year through  – to reach  billion to put that in perspective if you created a country named casinoland that got all of its gdp from gambling and absolutely nothing else… it would be the st richest country in the world  billion is approximately the gdp of saudi arabia and well north of argentina sweden norway or austria but as impressive as that is overall indian gaming growth in particular puts that to shame its growing twice as fast as the industry as a whole… and indian gaming is now larger than las vegas and atlantic city combined this isnt your grandfathers reservation casino today indian gaming is big big business to the tune of  billion in  and rising fast until recently though there wasnt much you could do about it unless you were the elder of a native american tribe you were completely locked out of this rapidly expanding wildly profitable industry until recently  being the key today there is one company  bingo nation otc blto in existence for less than a year  that gives you a direct in to the native american gambling industry in fact its the only pure play in the market today there is simply put nowhere else you can directly invest purely in native american casinos that fact alone makes bingo nation one of the most promising young companies in the world when theres only one way to invest in a massive fastgrowing industry that play will eventually attract attention but what takes bingo nation from unique solid choice to one of the hottest properties on the market are all the other advantages the company possesses like the fact that bingo nation is revolutionizing the way gambling works… making it possible to entirely legally gamble on your phone or in the comfort of your easychair in front of the tv or that bingo nation is the first company thats bridging different casinos and tribes tapping into the gambling action across dozens of sites and with exponentiallyincreasing takes bingo nation is able to produce eyepopping jackpots like no other game or that bingo nation has figured out a way to combine two games into one play  doubling its opportunities to capture attention and not coincidentally capturing a large and growing share of the younger gambling population its little surprise then that bingo nation is projected to generate revenue thats  above its current market cap that means if the price of the stock just kept up with revenue growth it would increase  by the end of the year of course thats not how stock prices actually work in actuality market caps are almost always much larger than a years revenue  usually by orders of magnitude in other words  growth in almost certainly too conservative an estimate true growth will likely be multiples higher and its all thanks to the revolutionary new platform and business model that bingo nation has invented  which youll learn more about in a moment but perhaps even more impressive is how incredibly safe this business model is if you had bought gambling stocks in  you would have beaten the market by  and made an easy  return in just  months but with special tax breaks and management projecting  a week in revenue bingo nation could put other gambling stocks to shame bingo nation inc otc blto the houses house the house always wins of course except when it doesnt because the truth of the matter is every game in a casino is guaranteed to make money… but the whole casino isnt because casinos have all sorts of extra expenses they have to run hotels and restaurants at the same time  often at steep discounts  which are far from safe bets they also provide entertainment  from magic acts like penn and teller to music acts like wayne newton to hosting fight nights none of that is cheap and of course casinos are constantly competing against each other as soon as a new one opens an older one loses business thats why casinos arent sure things they shut down they go bankrupt just ask the current resident of the white house but the companies that supply the games to casinos… thats another story because the casino games themselves always win just take a look at scientific gaming industries nasdaq sgms  one of the stalwarts of the industry that manufactures slot machines from its early stages  when it was young like bingo nation is today  it returned  in a short stretch or galaxy gaming inc otc glxz up  in the past five years or aristocrat leisure otc arluf rallied over  since  the examples are endless if you make the actual machines that casinos use well you basically have a license to print money heck – you even get to decide what frequency machines pay out at – meaning you get to decide ahead of time just how much money you make but  and this is key  bingo nation otc blto is different its got an even rosier outlook and thats because  unlike all the gaming manufacturers above  bingo nation isnt competing in an alreadyestablished field its introducing an entirely new type of action into indian casinos one that should prove even more lucrative than whats come before gambling stocks have delivered massive profits recently scientific games corp sgms up  in one year galaxy gaming inc glxz up  in just  months boyd gaming corporation byd up a smoking hot  could blto be bingo nation inc otc blto the gambling stock to finally make you rich the simplest way to describe bingo nations product is its like a lottery only its so much more its true  the base game works similar to a state lottery it takes in money gives out tickets  in the form of bingo sheets  and hands out a variety of prizes of varying size bingo nation machines can print out up to  million unique tickets each week think about that thats up to  million in revenue every week  just on the main game half the proceeds are handed out as winnings the other half gets split between the casino and bingo nation in other words if bingo nation sold  million tickets in a week it would get to keep  million every week as pure profit and thats for a company that at least at the time of writing only has a  million market cap youre starting to see why bingo nation has the potential to blast  higher in short order but  and this is key  what youve heard about so far is only the beginning like powerball but better you know when the nation starts paying attention to lottery jackpots right when a powerball jackpot starts getting huge usually once it passes  million people take notice and you get news stories of gas stations with lines out the door with everyone and their mother lining up for a chance at that juicy jackpot the way powerball jackpots get so large is by combining multiple states you cant get that much money lined up only collecting in new jersey… but if you add all of new england and the midatlantic states down to georgia  now youve got a powerball jackpot and huge jackpots work because they grab everyones attention powerball jackpots have been a huge boon for state lotteries theyve increased interest increased revenue what powerball has never done is increase casino profits until today thats because bingo nation finally figured out how to create a powerballlike system for casinos all of their machines  across every casino  are linked together for certain drawings their powerball drawings if someone wins the first one great  they get a huge payday but if a jackpot rolls over once… and then twice… well it works just like it does in state lotteries you get a feeding frenzy only this frenzy isnt made up of hopeful citizens youre dealing with folks who have come out specifically to gamble i have been following the progress of bingo nation for years it creates the win win opportunity for tribal enterprise our investors and players alike just like powerball did for its multistate run lotteries but if you think this is the end of the story… just wait it gets better armchair casino get this bingo nations users dont even have to be inside the casino to play once they have their ticket they can watch online or on tv for the weekly drawings thats right  bingo nation has brought legal gambling to your living room in fact you dont even have to go into the casino at any point you can just give your players card to someone else who can place your bet for you this is to put it succinctly a gamechanger it might be the most revolutionary innovation to hit casinos since there have been casinos this marks a potentially drastic increase in players… and gaming revenue but if you think bingo nation is resting on its laurels think yet again bingo nation inc otc blto drawing in the next generation the biggest problem casinos face is demographics millennials the people who frequent casinos get older and older… but in order to make a good business game makers need to captivate the next generation so far no one has figured it out except bingo nation in addition to its bingo lottery games  which appeal to an older generation  bingo nation has a second hybrid way to play think of it as a lottery with an instant payoff like a scratch ticket and this form of gambling has proven very popular with younger players in addition bingo nation is developing mobile app games for later this year theyll be available on both android and iphone and theyre free to play these apps are going to get more players familiar with the games  an important barrier to lots of potential customers if they can get to know the game safely for free in private theyre much more likely to give it a shot in public but  perhaps even more importantly  these apps will work as a cheap accurate form of research and development bingo nation can try out tweaks  or entirely new games  with no risk and see if the public has an appetite for them if so they can put them on casino floors and if a game is a flop the company didnt have to spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars developing it free apps like this are the wave of the future its easy to imagine an upcoming time of looser restrictions and regulations when brickandmortar casinos go away and apps like these take over all gambling thats a faroff vision for now but bingo nation is already thinking ahead and with the incredible powerful market research these apps can provide today theyre a nobrainer the only surprising thing is that more companies havent done this already bingo for the hitech generation why bingo nation is the future of gaming bingo nation is much more than a stock that promises massive returns for early investors its also a high tech company set to disrupt the entire gaming industry bingo nation has developed a series of patentpending gaming technologies including selfserve kiosks player cards and a mobile app that lets players check their stats on their phone all of bingo nations patents have been inspected and approved by gaming laboratories international the world’s leading electronic games testing organization what does that mean for investors that all of bingo nations gaming technologies are ready to go to market and start pumping out profits investors snapshot bingo nation inc otc blto rating strong buy confidence high first profit target  gainfirst half let the rest ride second profit target  gainsecond half the only game in town dont forget bingo nation is exclusively catering to indian casinos for good reason  they make up the largest gambling segment in america yet there is almost no way to invest in them you cant own parts of the casinos and the very few publiclytraded companies that supply indian casinos do so as a small part of a larger business the only way to get a piece of this  billion industry is through bingo nation otc blto its got all the tools in place and the right people running the company and theres no better time to get in than right now this is your moment why now simple  bingo nation has only been around a short while – so its still cheap in january  bingo nation received its certification from gaming laboratories international gli thats the governing body that decides what companies can install gambling hardware and software on casino floors in other words only this january the key went in the ignition and the motor started running already machines are being installed across the nation and as more and more casinos see the potent combination of powerball style jackpots playathome potential along with hybrid lottery and instant games the steady drumbeat of orders will turn into an avalanche and all of this is before the apps are released this summer introducing an entirely new audience  and generation  to bingo nation games in other words the stock is cheap today because there isnt even a single quarters worth of profits to talk about yet but that wont be true in three months and it certainly wont be true in six months bingo nation is planning a kiosk rollout in  and up to an average of  million in ticket sales every week thats equal to  million in ticket profits every week to bingo nation some of that will be eaten up by initial outlays for the kiosks and development – but theres no doubt thats serious money for a company with a tiny  million market cap simply put the cap cant stay this low for long as  witnesses the burgeoning success of bingo nation investors are going to come rolling in a company that can bring in  million in revenue in its first full year can easily justify a market cap of over  billion with the astonishing growth such a situation implies  billion is probably too cheap a price but theres no need to be greedy we can build in some unforeseen bumps… a misfortune or two… and say that a mere  increase is enough to hope for that would just mean a  million market cap that would just equal revenue that would still be an insanely cheap stock but it would be an insanely great investment at todays valuations before bingo nation becomes buzzworthy throughout the  billion indian casino industry you want to get in this is still a groundfloor opportunity by the second half of  the big money will likely already have been made if youre looking for meaningful profit in your investment portfolio you need to research bing nation otc blto today if youre looking for a opportunity to earn a  return this is your time to act right now the native american gaming industry generates  billion taxfree income every year it has been nearly impossible for investors to access until now bingo nation inc otc blto the gambling industry is on fire with  delivering absolutely explosive returns annual gambling revenue has skyrocketed to  billion  approaching the  billion mark for the first time ever the dow jones us gambling industry index rose  in   easily beating the overall stock markets return of  if you had invested  in the gambling index on january   you would made made a cool  in just  months and if you had invested the same amount in the biggest gainers in the industry youd have made a mindblowing  that destroys the  youd have earned investing in the dow but there is one stock that promises to deliver even bigger returns than these a stock that could blow the dow out of the water by x a stock that that inject a quick  or even  into your brokerage account if you get in early a stock with so much upside potential it could easily be the biggest gainer of  bingo nation inc otc blto opportunities like this do not last long bingo nation is has the potential to grow into one of the biggest gaming companies in the nation its platform has been tested and certified by gli the leading electronic gaming testing and inspection company it is set to roll out over  bingo card kiosks across the country projected to bring in up to  million in weekly revenue its income is largely tax exempt being a native american tribal enterprise it is part of a sector that had an average return of  last year and the topperformers in the same industry like galaxy gaming delivered  or last year alone …and thats without the huge tax advantages that bingo nation enjoys stocks like this have given investors   even  returns if youve been wanting a quick injection of cash into your investment portfolio if want to profit you need to take a look at this stock right now  before it announces
