in las vegas as hundreds of friends colleagues and family assembled in the hard rock hotel to celebrate dwight miller and his fifty years as a beauty professional dozens of his former colleagues took to the stage to roast miller and share stories the few that could be shared of how he touched and impacted each and the industry in general miller has touched so many throughout his journey in the industry he regularly found the most talented hairdressers and guided them in their own journeys more than  people were in attendance including  robert passage johnny plant nadeen koepky albie mulcahy margo leduc vocalist from san francisco and phillip sutton long time friend and associate carl bloat was there to coproduce the special event modern was honored to work with miller throughout his career working with him on covers or editorial spreads we were there to learn more about him at the celebration as he was roasted by such luminaries as eden sassoon eric fisher luis alvarez and john donato grabbing a comment from dwight at the event was a bit difficult he was mobbed all the time so we tracked him down the following day not surprisingly he was already back working with clients at his salon sante fe inc in sante fe new mexico a city miller describes as “paradise” but the celebration really did impact him “having so many of the industries finest the most recognizable names one after the other…wow once in a lifetime  what a way to celebrate this moment” the event all orchestrated by charlet pelissier miller’s “better half” was truly special a reunion of top artists and industry leaders when asked for a highlight miller said it was impossible “there were so many” he said “but the film from angus mitchell  the presentation from vidal’s daughter eden comments from sponsors like zotos matrix pivot point int’l aquage atar gold and then past members of my teams coming to the stage was great luis alvarez gets the most heads up for impersonating me during the roast having charlet’s and my families at naha and the celebration including nieces nephews and my godson’s family these are all highlights” for the few of you who don’t know him dwight miller is a widely acclaimed world master hairdesigner and industry leader a true industry authority he has traveled the world sharing his knowledge and developing new talent in a nutshell miller was destined to be a salon professional born in johnstown pa from ancestry of amish english and scottish he eventually moved to california and graduated from the comer  doran beauty school in san diego his expertise was noted early and he eventually became a benchmark player with such names as marinellocomer lapin’s redken pivot point zotos matrix american crew anasazi john frieda amos john sahag and v l v t he was the first us born stylist to be invited by vidal sassoon to come train in london with his team appearances at the world congress and alternative in london to italy’s cosmoprof to the world  european championships were as important to miller as his appearances on stage for hundreds of salons schools distributors and universities his work has appeared in trade and fashion magazines and he has appeared on radio and television internationally not surprisingly he has been invited to judge hair competitions around the world from naha to the norwegian master and australian national championships for fifty years miller has been at the root of major changes in hair fashion and technique from the sculpture pin curl of marinellocomer in hollywood to sassoon’s strongest period of cutting in london systems produced by miller like pivot point’s sculptic cutting program ’ are the basis for training students around the world he was instrumental in refining pivot point’s original systems in the late s as the author of the cutting system in the milady standard ii ’ master cutting system ’ his influence will be felt long into the future prismatics ‘ haircutting system one of the best examples of his ability  knowledge one of the best books on the subject  sold in the first two months of it’s release  now in reprint makes him one of the strongest underlying influences in the

artists institute  registry and founder  president of anasazi salon systems santa fe nm s he is now a consultant for educational companies product manufactures professional retail domestic  int’l but
