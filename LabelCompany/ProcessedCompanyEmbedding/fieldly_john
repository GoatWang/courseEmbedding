experience to search a positive consumer and trade feedback has the new package debut on store shelves early january in mature retailers the yearoveryear reorders appear to show doubledigit growth and retailers stand data indicate the same momentum the most significant aspect of the rebrand is the move to solidify celsius disposition as a fitness train and arm trend lifestyle brand with mass appeal for consumption at any time of day for those who wish to live an active healthy lifestyle versus a quick calorie burning diet drink the classification of diet or calorie burner or just healthy energy alone did not communicate the unique clinically proven attributes and brand benefits celsius’ proprietary formula provides just as tagline live fit cause consumers to take action to invest in

category has a clear advantage of retail as the traders recognize in the consumers desires to move beyond traditional sugary or hscs drinks in all categories retailers are seeking new ways to bring cutting edge function to their shelf directionally yearoveryear sales growth and mature direct ship retail chain ecommerce and fitness channel drove the growth first quarter last year however in

well as the launch of the second product line in our portfolio  now celsius heat also a dietary supplement heat include the celsius proprietary thermogenic formula metaplus blend which when combined with exercise is proven to accelerate metabolism burn body fat in calories and provide energy heat however also offers added caffeine and lcitruline which is a vasodialator the new heat line is available in three flavors in inferno punch blueberry pomegranate and cherry lime we are excited with the initial orders and customer response from our national fitness channel distribution partners major club chains and local studios celsius heat was developed for athletic trainer body builders military personnel and endurance athletes it is sold outside of fitness channel in the vitamin shop retail locations and their website as well in preparation for the feeding and selling of the two new product introduction the team expanded with two new hires director of the fitness channel bryan alesiano formerly of glanbia performance nutrition and a director of the national channel paula burke formerly of the kind snack company they will speed up the launches of the new products in their

underway to work with our swedish partner func foods on involving the can in the nordic market to include the global brand market other distinctive features and future packaging these changes will bring together a cohesive branded appearance and positioning of a fitness strength staging celsius as brand for global expansion i will now turn the call back to john to provide details on our financial results john john fieldly thank you vanessa total revenues for the first quarter of  were  million compared to  million for the corresponding period in  this  increase was driven primarily by an  growth in domestic sales which was driven by blended growth rates of  growth in retailer accounts  growth in health and fitness accounts where the product continues to resonate well in addition we saw an  growth in internet retailer account in addition our international sales grew at a healthy  yearoveryear gross profit for the quarter was  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenues for the corresponding period last year the increase in gross profit are in dollar basis is primarily due to increases in revenue and reduction in cost of raw materials the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is the result of a onetime charge of  associated with the writedown the old packaging and fees associated with our new label changes excluding this onetime charges gross profit increased  basis points or  percentage points to  compared to the prior year period operating expenses in the first quarter of  increased  million to  million up from  million in the prior year period this increase was driven in part by an increase of  in sales and marketing and investment in human resources warehousing costs and certain marketing programs the increase in operating expense was also driven by an increase in general and administrative expenses which included extraordinary level of nonrecurring items during the first quarter of  ga expense for the first quarter of  were  million compared to  in the first quarter of  the increase in the first quarter of  was driven by an increase of options expense  investments in human resources professional fees and increases in research and development costs compared to the first quarter  in addition the first quarter included  first quarter of  included onetime charges of  for ceo retirement and transition costs and  stockbased compensation for directors the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by reduction in travel expense total other expense was  for the first quarter of  compared to  for the quarter in  this march decrease was a result of lower interest expense on a lower outstanding balance net loss to common shareholders for the first quarter of  was  million or a loss  per share compared to a net loss of  million or  per share basic and diluted for the corresponding period last year net loss attributable to common shareholders is inclusive of preferred dividends for the three months ending march   and  the net losses include preferred dividend of  and  respectively operating expenses for the quarter included noncash expense include appreciation amortization and stockbased compensation totaling approximately  compared to  last year adjusted ebitda for the quarter excluding onetime charges was  compared to a negative adjusted ebitda of  for the corresponding period in  adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  excluded nonrecurring items as discussed earlier the  for ceo retirement and transition costs and  for writedown of old packaging and fees associated with the new label changes we believe information concerning adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure enhances over our understanding in our financial performance a reconciliation of our gaap results to this nongaap measure was included in our earnings press release turning to the balance sheet as of march   company had cash and cash equivalents of  million and working capital of  million at this time we believe our current cash balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash need over the next  months cash used in operations for the first three months of  totaled  compared to  in the first three months of  before i turn the call over for questions i would like thank tim leissner one of our board members for his service to the board and company tim’s last day on the board was may th on behalf of the board management shareholders we thank tim leissner for his service over the last several years in the interim to our next annual shareholder meeting i was appointed to his vacancy on another note we will be presented at the upcoming th annual b riley  co investor conference in santa monica on wednesday may th i encourage you all to attend we look forward this meeting  meeting many of you that concludes our prepared remarks operator you may now open the call for questions thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ph paul johnson  private investor please state your question paul you may be on mute unidentified analyst i am sorry can you hear me now john fieldly yes hi paul good afternoon thank you unidentified analyst yeah so maybe if you can just help investors understand why weve had fairly sudden departures lately of key people first it was gerry and now tim leissner already these few were been with the company for long time tim i think he has invested a lot of money in the company and while i appreciate your thanking for his help that the offset in the room is why were he suddenly so quickly and i think you kind of need to answer those questions the second question maybe related or maybe not it has to do with the expansion in china i think i had asked in the last call why it’s going to take so incredibly long to go to mainland china when you have watson as a partner because distribution is everything and we already have it and the third thing related to that is why do we need all this cash if we are not going to be expanding in the china and other areas the sales are up big yearoveryear but sequentially they have been flat for the last three quarters it’s been sort of  million  million  million so i  anyway yeah i know those are unrelated questions but if you want to take one at a time that would be great john fieldly sure thank you paul on the departures question just starting off with gerry i think gerry came to the company nearly on a th birthday we all knew that this might be his last turnaround during that time i am not sure his retirement it was a surprise to some folks over the last five years he really built the first foundation for the company we do have a solid infrastructure in place and the company couldn’t be better positioned right now for the future so that was a unfortunately it was felt like it was his time that’s all i can really comment on that again for the recent board of director change with tim he stepped down for personal reasons we do have chris lai who is taking his cochair role from horizons so we still have a great horizons presence on board as well so and  that his personal reasons unfortunately so we will continue to move forward with that solid with the management team that we have in place and our current of board of directors in regard to your comment in china in regards to china we continue to as i have mentioned on prior calls we will continue to leverage the interest  the networks of our investors as we mentioned earlier we are preparing for a launch in hong kong with as watson as that is our starting point and we’ll look at extending at that point i not going to provide forwardlooking information at this point as we continue to move forward but at this time we are focused on a successful launch in the third quarter in hong kong with as watson and then well take it from there at that point in regards to deploy private placement which took place we are going to  we are using that to fund our global expansion as well as product innovation as well as our working capital needs so partial portion of that  those funds that are arranged to the private placement will be utilize for the expansion initiated in singapore as well as hong kong and also allocated to some of the product innovation that we just most recently came out with celsius heat at our national alliance and also future innovation does that answer… unidentified analyst okay yeah i know you did answer the questions thank you i guess the only other question was just why does  given how well things seem to be doing in all the various retail channels particularly domestically why have the sales i know there is some seasonality but why are the sales been sort of flat for the last three quarters john fieldly yeah we continued to show great growth domestically if you look at our domestic front and you look at the numbers we reported domestically we continue to show great results domestically over doubledigit growth rates and i might add that domestically when you look at some quarteroverquarter growth which was mentioned last time on our prior call domestically we grown our quarteroverquarter basis  when you look at fourth quarter domestically first quarter results so we are growing domestically what impacting the numbers is our  is mainly our international revenues which is coming mainly from our swedish distribution partner over the last several quarters as we reported they have had  we have some contraction on their inventory levels we are seeing good results there we  and expect consistent working patterns going forward but that has really impacted our over topline revenue number as we look at our quarterly growth over the last several quarters so when you look at exclusively the domestic revenues i think you get a broader picture a much better results on a quartertoquarter basis and yearoveryear basis unidentified analyst good enough thank you just one more question about any news on possible nasdaq uplifting john fieldly not at this time except when we disclose before we continue to pursue we have integral application as has been closed prior and we will continue to move through the process at this point in time that’s all i have unidentified analyst very good thank you john fieldly thank you paul operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of ph david benson  private investor please state your question unidentified analyst hello vanessa and john it’s david vanessa walker hi david john fieldly hi david unidentified analyst so you have taken some significant time to prepare the hong kong launch and i am assuming a portion of that has gone into a sales and marketing strategy in particular digital strategy do you feel like you have the digital piece and the advertising piece in place and is that different from the united states could you describe that a little vanessa walker sure i will fill that question unidentified analyst sure vanessa walker with regard to hong kong i happen to be landing there on saturday morning  in the morning wheels up on my way to hong kong we do have agencies in hong kong and we have people on the ground in hong kong who are looking after the launch as well we are partnering with on our connection of horizon who are helping us with press  public relation and other trade and marketing events on a localized level but we speak more towards specifically the hong kong trade in press so we do have a plan placed we have a hong kong launch plan we have an agency in place we are localizing those events and we are creating digital awareness next week when i arrive will be confirming and solidifying some those plans which will be than play into motion as a key during the fact but the lunch itself should be forthcoming in the beginning of the third quarter so we still have a better ways to go however we have created plans and we do have excellent partners and we feel confident that we will have a nice lunch unidentified analyst great and a followup question assuming the launch in hong kong goes well would you then launch in china in total or would you do something like launch in and i am going to mispronounce this guangdong which is just north of hong kong which of course is highly populated how  have you laid any groundwork for how you would proceed in china proper based on what happens in hong kong vanessa walker china as a whole is an interesting place in terms of launch as you know they got the business province by province unidentified analyst yeah vanessa walker however we have not made plans of it yet to discuss launch plans or timing for china i will turn that over to john john fieldly yeah thank you and thank you david for your question at this point in time we are really just focused on executing hong kong at this point we have to pace ourselves as we continue to move forward we are looking forward to following as i mentioned before our investors networks but at this point in time the team is extremely focused on this hong kong launch which we are very excited about unidentified analyst great thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of drew justman with madison asset management please state your question drew justman hello thanks for taking my call i guess i would like to followup on some of the china questions i haven’t heard much of an update about madam wang and her distribution within china over the past of conference calls is there an update there or has something changed john fieldly yeah no we continue as i mentioned before on the last call i mean we are really focusing on hong kong at this point and we are going to continue to move through the networks as we move forward our main focus at this point is really focusing on our net loss and hong kong with our launch we are still working on continue to move forward with singapore as well so at this point in time we don’t  i am not going to provide any forward looking information at this point in time as information comes readily available we will put that up to the public but at this point in time we are really focusing on hong kong drew justman okay i guess i am confused why it was mentioned on prior conference calls then or in the wall street transcript madam wang and the huge distribution opportunity in china was highlighted so but now the company is not going to doesn’t want to discuss that john fieldly we have to double check those transcripts we are working we have talks with madam wang and we still continue to move forward but i don’t have any tangible information to disclose at this time we continue to leverage the networks but there is  i don’t have an update at this time drew justman okay understood the placement in the  really did a nice job of kind of taking sales to another level higher and without getting into specifics is there expectation on the part of management that the hong kong launch can do another similar wang hire vanessa walker i think with regard to hong kong i believe that we will have a fantastic positive effect for the overall region and the sales of the company and the international sales of the company and i believe with our contacts as john mentioned your distribution partner as watson will be able to access the many key retail chains through their relationship so we are anticipating that we will have a successful and but the product will  i believe your question was are we anticipating that it will sees us with  inaudible  in united states we don’t know the answer of that but we are planning for success drew justman understood i just have a few more questions if you don’t mind john fieldly okay drew justman i am a little surprise to hear sweden mentioned being a little bit weak again i thought maybe that was in the review here but sounds they have kind of brought down some of their inventories are their plans to put under restock or are this kind of they are going run rate now for sweden john fieldly thank you it’s really a timing of orders we continue to maintain a number two position in energy and number one in fitness inaudible  they actually  they  based on the last report they increase their market share and continue to perform very well in the region so we expect them to continue to move towards normalized ordering pattern they have  they came a little bit below our expectations in q but we anticipate that to continue on as it has in prior years drew justman okay two quick questions for me any update on whole foods and i think the product was changed so to get placed in there is that still on track vanessa walker whole foods has been a target retail account for us and obviously it’s wholly grill of the natural channel being a key anchor as we said our sites in creating a natural line extension we hope that we will deliver the ability to access new consumers future consumers through the national channel and anchor the whole foods chain nation why that we are teaching them and we will continue to set our sites on the buyer and the selling cycle and try to sell that in as part of our overall strategy to tackle the national channel with the new natural expansion drew justman okay thank you last question for me you  any general timeline on when permanent ceo might be named john fieldly thank you drew just to give an update on that the board is currently reviewing the candidates they are coming towards the more the late rounds i don’t have exact timing on that but i know its most likely be in the near future drew justman okay great thank you for taking my questions i appreciate it have a nice day john fieldly okay thank you drew vanessa walker thank you operator thank you there are no further questions that does conclude our questionandanswer session at this time i will now turn it back to mr john fieldly for closing comments john
