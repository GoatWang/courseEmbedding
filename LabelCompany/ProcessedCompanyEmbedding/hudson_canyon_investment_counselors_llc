in person interview questions to ask advisors as you begin to talk with advisors you’ll want to evaluate them objectively asking each advisor a consistent set of questions will help ensure that you have the information you need to make a good comparison what are your credentials an advisor’s professional designations can tell you a great deal about his or her education and areas of expertise cfp® certified financial planner™ cfp professionals have completed universitylevel financial planning coursework and passed a hour exam covering nearly  topics from group medical insurance to derivatives more information  cfa® chartered financial analyst® cfas must pass three exams each of which demands a minimum of  hours of study and includes corporate finance and financial statements more information  pfs personal financial specialist personal financial specialists are certified public accountants who specialize in personal financial planning the credential requires a detailed exam and significant financial planning expertise more information  cima® certified investment management analyst® cimas focus on asset allocation and typically complete final coursework at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley or at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school of business more information  suggestion  visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification common credentials  this is not a complete list of certifications there is no implied endorsement of one certification over another professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values do you offer the services i need investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide in general they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below money managers if you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing consider money managers they design investment portfolios generally consisting of stocks bonds and other individual securities often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you may not offer general financial planning services financial planners if you need someone to review your situation and help with bigpicture planning consider financial planners they help you look to the future and do longterm financial planning in the areas of retirement college funding wealth transfer tax planning and insurance may not offer investing and portfolio management services wealth managers if you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs consider wealth managers they provide highly personalized comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for highnetworth clients coordinate with other professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants to serve more complex financial needs which may include tax minimization trust management wealth transfers real estate management and portfolio performance analytics how are you compensated knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive independent advisors generally work on a feeonly or feepluscommissions basis types of compensation and what they mean to you fee only assetbased hourly or flat fees many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you typically – this compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific onetime service eg developing a financial plan the fee may vary by account size and service in addition to these fees you may pay commissions andor other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets fee plus commissions along with an advisory or financial planning fee some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends such as insurance policies or annuities commissions only advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you wrap fees sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee which is typically a single assetbased fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make how will we work together good communication between you and your advisor is essential asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect what to ask with whom will i work in some cases the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it if personal rapport is important to you ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with how often will we communicate regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals risk tolerance and investment strategy typically your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email how will you report performance at a minimum you should expect to receive account statements from the advisor or custodianbrokerage firm where your assets are held quarterly summaries of yeartodate investment performance a comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor what is the size of your firm a firm’s size – including the number of employees the assets under management and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services small firms may offer more personalized attention the average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm how do you approach investing for people like me things to consider performance ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks such as the sp ® index during the same time period an advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark investment style advisors may specialize in certain types of investments such as mutual funds stocks or bonds and styles such as growth or value you can assess whether the advisors methodology or style aligns with your objectives asking about an advisors investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand decisionmaking advisors who have a disciplined approach to decisionmaking may be more likely to stay focused on your longterm goals many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time your strategy should be based on your goals time horizon and comfort with risk knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic longterm approach or invests in shortterm trends past performance does not guarantee future results the sp ® index is an index of widely traded stocks indexes are unmanaged do not incur fees or expenses and cannot be invested in directly where will my assets be held independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks mutual funds and other assets why should you ask this question you want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets look for a custodian with important services such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information

                                � hudson canyon investment counselors llc  all rights reserved   hudson canyon investment counselors llc institutional equity investment process hudson canyon�s institutional equity investment style is large capitalization core the most important decision in the investment process is asset allocation we adhere to a policy of staying fully invested with minimal cash  we then follow a three step �topdown bottomup� investment process the three steps are sector weightings individual stock selection and portfolio construction sector weightingswe overweight underweight or equal weight our portfolios relative to the ten sectors that comprise the sp  index some of the factors we analyze in determining sector weightings include the rate of and trend in consumer spending interest rates energy prices business spending commodity prices industrial production and the strength or weakness of the us dollar individual stock selectionhudson canyon invests in the stocks of largecapitalization usbased companies and american depository receipts adrs that have long histories of success and are generally considered leaders in their industry we generally look to buy companies that are trading at the lowend of their historical valuation range we also typically seek companies that have a year earnings per share growth rate that exceeds the forward price earnings ratio and that have returns on equity of at least  we sell a stock when its current stock price becomes expensive relative to historical valuation when fundamentals deteriorate due to increasing competitive pressures or when there is an unexpected change in senior management portfolio constructionour clients� portfolios typically hold about  stocks annual turnover is generally in the  to  range the weightings of our holdings range from between  to  of the portfolio     � hudson canyon investment counselors llc  all rights reserved   active interest rate management active interest rate management the investment objective of our active interest rate management strategy attempts to maximize total return through us treasury note us bond or us treasury backed etfs appreciation secondarily our approaches seek income generation from us treasury note us bond holdings and or us treasury related etfs we believe that by improving the potential for wealth accumulation our strategies help address the risk of outliving one’s wealth without taking on equity market volatility our decision to utilize us treasuries is strategic and best accommodates our approach to interest rate risk management strategically the barclays us treasury index has over time produced returns competitive with those of the barclays government credit and barclays aggregate indices since their respective inceptions since issues of “callability” and prepayment are not an issue for treasury securities or treasury related etfs we can simplify the process to achieve our duration targets—the price sensitivity of our portfolios to changes in interest rates over time our duration strategy attempts to add value to the treasury benchmark our duration decisions are driven by our proprietary discipline—the interest rate scorecard the scorecard combines measures of economic growth inflationary expectations and investor sentiment to identify where we are in the interest rate cycle once the outlook for rates is determined in our monthly review the portfolio’s duration is setthere is no overriding of the scorecard’s output the scorecard has evolved from research begun in the s its first application to asset management was in the s and it was introduced as a “wrap platform” investment discipline at a major brokerdealer in the s we offer two related approaches in the active interest rate management strategy long only discipline and long short discipline the long only discipline has a typical duration range from  short maturity treasury bill to duration double that of the barclays us treasury index or roughly  years over time the approach will have an average duration and as a consequence yield roughly equal to that of the index or about  years the long short discipline has a typical duration range from  twice that of the index or roughly  to  years it thus has the potential to add value beyond preservation of capital long only in a rising rate environment it is best thought of as an alternative investment which complements existing bond holdings          � hudson canyon investment counselors llc  all rights reserved   hudson canyon investment

profiteering despite paying fines  image from sixth tonethe short get out of jail free china’s lenient antimonopoly laws   china’s national development and reform commission ndrc levied a fine of  million yuan  million on medtronic the world’s highestgrossing medical equipment company however the investigation by the ndrc into medtronic’s violations only began in  allowing for the possibility that abuses had continued for more than eight years in total in medtronic’s case the percent figure comes out to  billion yuan for the  fiscal year — much more than the company’s total fine a better response would be to confiscate illegal gains or to model the law on countries in the european union that set the maximum fine at  percent of a company’s global profits a closer look at the fine print also reveals that the ndrc did not investigate all of medtronic’s business in mainland china again because of its narrow definition of “income” instead it only accounted for around  billion yuan of the company’s total  billion yuan in sales revenue in exchange the ndrc exacted an antimonopoly fine of only  million yuan and did not pursue the investigation in other provinces similarly the medtronic case raises several questions did the ndrc use the “mercedes model” to secure medtronic’s cooperation with the antimonopoly investigation state broadcaster cctv reported that the antimonopoly investigation team had to place more than  international calls to the company’s us like mercedesbenz the company withdrew its rebuttal of the antimonopoly enforcement organizations this allows lawbreakers to continue engaging in illegal activity knowing that the maximum fine will never exceed their existing illegal gains second china’s antimonopoly law stipulates that the fine for refusing to cooperate stalling or wasting enforcement resources during the antimonopoly investigation is capped at only  million yuan this significantly lowers the base fine imposed on the company this autonomy prevails regardless of the duration of illegal activity or the extent of its damage the case clearly shows that the extensive discretion enjoyed by enforcement agencies has been coopted by lawbreakers to exploit china’s antimonopoly regulations and give lobbyists more room to pressure the law enforcement agencies a working draft of a policy document aimed at tightening fining procedures was released in june  but it was condemned for lacking detail finally the courts should protect the right of consumers affected by companies that flout antimonopoly laws to sue those

that you have the information you need to make a good comparison what are your credentials an advisor’s professional designations can tell you a great deal about his or her education and areas of expertise cfp® certified financial planner™ cfp professionals have completed universitylevel financial planning coursework and passed a hour exam covering nearly  topics from group medical insurance

school of business at the university of california berkeley or at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school of business more information  suggestion  visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification common credentials  this is not a complete list of certifications there is no implied endorsement of one certification over another professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values do you offer the services i need investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide in general they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below money managers if you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing consider money managers they design investment portfolios generally consisting of stocks bonds and other individual securities often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you may not offer general financial planning services financial planners if you need someone to review your situation and help with bigpicture planning consider financial planners they help you look to the future and do longterm financial planning in the areas of retirement college funding wealth transfer tax planning and insurance may not offer investing and portfolio management services wealth managers if you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs consider wealth managers they provide highly personalized comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for highnetworth clients coordinate with other professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants to serve more complex financial needs which may include tax minimization trust management wealth transfers real estate management and portfolio performance analytics how are you compensated knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive independent advisors generally work on a feeonly or feepluscommissions basis types of compensation and what they mean to you fee only assetbased hourly or flat fees many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you typically – this compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific onetime service eg developing a financial plan the fee may vary by account size and service in addition to these fees you may pay commissions andor other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets fee plus commissions along with an advisory or financial planning fee some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends such as insurance policies or annuities commissions only advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you wrap fees sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee which is typically a single assetbased fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make how will we work together good communication between you and your advisor is essential asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect what to ask with whom will i work in some cases the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it if personal rapport is important to you ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with how often will we communicate regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals risk tolerance and investment strategy typically your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email how will you report performance at a minimum you should expect to receive account statements from the advisor or custodianbrokerage firm where your assets are held quarterly summaries of yeartodate investment performance a comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor what is the size of your firm a firm’s size – including the number of employees the assets under management and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services small firms may offer more personalized attention the average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm how do you approach investing for people like me things to consider performance ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks such as the sp ® index during the same time period an advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark investment style advisors may specialize in certain types of investments such as mutual funds stocks or bonds and styles such as growth or value you can assess whether the advisors methodology or style aligns with your objectives asking about an advisors investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand decisionmaking advisors who have a disciplined approach to decisionmaking may be more likely to stay focused on your longterm goals many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time your strategy should be based on your goals time horizon and comfort with risk knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic longterm approach or invests in shortterm trends past performance does not guarantee future results the sp ® index is an index of widely traded stocks indexes are unmanaged do not incur fees or expenses and cannot be invested in directly where will my assets be held independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks mutual funds and other assets why should you ask this question you want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets look for a custodian with important services such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information
