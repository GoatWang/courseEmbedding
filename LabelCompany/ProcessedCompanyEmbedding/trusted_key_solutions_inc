rekey module ar automates both the generation and distribution of cryptographic keys for atms the ar is compatible with atms that use rsaenabled encrypting pin pads epps the ar implements diebold and tritons certificate based protocol cbp and ncr wincornixdorf and hyosung’s signature based protocol sbp that are based on standards as defined in the ans x standard on retail cryptographic key management the ar also is programmed to work with wincornixdorf’s signature based protocol which tss refers to as wsbp and unit testing has been successfully completed but has yet to be field testedthe diebold approach uses x certificates and pkcs message formats to transport key data ncrs method relies on digital signatures to ensure data integrity tritons remote key protocol uses a triton developed form of cbp integrated with a unique host identification which tss refers to as tcbp all remote key protocols require the atms epp to be loaded at the factory with signed public keys or certificates in addition as part of the initialization process at least one a key pair must be generated and the public key signed by a certificate authority ie diebold ncr or triton and imported back into the a before the a can successfully communicate with the public key atm a separate signed key pair or set of signed certificates are required for each atm manufacturerremote key loading of atms is considered by most networks and standards groups as being more secure than traditional methods that use paper key components and the concepts of dual control split knowledge to maintain compliancewith the ar remote key modulekey check values and the atm epp serial number is automatically logged for later retrieval and reporting rekeying events can be initiated from authorized users using their desktops or a web portal new remote key protocols can and will be added in the form of field upgrades as they become commercially availablefor more information about the ar please contact
