or einhorn but rather smith as in jeff smith the boyishlooking yearold cofounder and ceo of a previously obscure  billion activist hedge fund called starboard value in october smith accomplished something that even his more flamboyant betterknown activist peers can’t boast about he took effective control of a fortune  company—darden restaurants the owner of olive garden and longhorn steakhouse which ranked no  with some  billion in sales last year—while owning less than  of the company thanks to his success in running a highly contested proxy contest smith replaced the entire member board of directors and assumed the role of chairman along with his handpicked board he will soon choose a new ceo to run darden welcome to the new world of corporate takeoversrelatedretirementthe best ways to invest in bonds nowretirementthe best ways to invest in bonds nowsmith is well aware that his stunning victory represents a landmark moment in a longrunning debate what is the ­correct balance of control over publicly traded companies between management and shareholders after a brilliantly ­executed campaign that included both withering public criticism of darden’s dri leadership and careful courtship of the company’s other major shareholders smith now professes that his focus is on improving the performance of darden not celebrating his coup but he also knows that he has fired a shot over the bow of directors everywhere shareholders particularly noisy ones running activist hedge funds are ascendant—and managers ignore them at their peril “it was really amazing how many people reached out to me in the days following to say that they had a conversation with a ceo who said ‘the world has just changed’ ” says smiththere is little question anymore that activist investors have become a powerful force across corporate america driving changes not only in boardrooms but also in executive suites the old master of the game carl icahn  has become the richest man on wall street with an estimated fortune of some  billion by tactically applying pressure on ceos to extract say stock buybacks and a couple of seats on the board then selling his stake for a handsome profit and in the years following the financial crisis a host of agitators have followed his example since the end of  according to hedge fund research the amount of money in activist hedge funds has jumped from  billion to  billion activists such as bill ackman of ­pershing square capital greenlight capital’s david einhorn and dan loeb of third point have become adept at the art of shaking things up see “activist investors the best and worst performers of ” for more on recent activist campaigns but the scope of smith’s triumph with darden has left jaws hanging open across wall street and beyond only in a handful of times in the past few years has an activist managed to replace an entire board of directors and never at a company the size of dardenthe story of how starboard outmaneuvered darden’s leadership is a cautionary tale for managers and directors everywhere the board that smith went up against was chockfull of talent and experience among them were longtime ceos investment bankers a former us senator a business school professor and senior executives at walmart and gannett both the board and the company were advised by wall street’s best—including goldman sachs morgan stanley and wachtell lipton the powerful law firm yet they played into smith’s hands at every turn for example when smith publicly blistered darden for selling its struggling red lobster seafood chain the directors privately scoffed at his analysis but refused to hold a special meeting with shareholders—alienating other investors in the process eventually at the proxy vote on oct  frustrated darden shareholders such as capital research and management which owns around  of darden and vanguard group which owns around  handed an overwhelming victory to smith “they were blind to how their actions were going to directly lead to this result” says smith of the old board “it’s kind of surprising”no doubt the directors felt blindsided steve odland the ceo of the committee on economic development and a former ceo of office depot was nominated to be a new independent board member at darden in the months before the october shareholder vote like the other directors proposed by darden in a lastditch effort to reach a compromise with smith odland lost he empathizes with the ousted darden directors “my sense from having met the darden board members is that they’re very highly qualified people” he explains “as i look at it i say ‘gee this could happen to any board’ these people had followed everything that was good governance and done what they were supposed to do and it happened to them”starboard wasn’t the first hedge fund to spot weakness at darden the activist assault actually began in june  when barington capital group started buying shares in the company and offered its view with management that darden could increase its stock price by cutting costs to bring its expenses more in line with its peers that september barington wrote a letter to darden’s board recommending that darden form two independently managed restaurant companies one made up of the slowergrowing chains olive garden and red lobster the other comprising darden’s fastergrowing restaurants such as capital grille yard house eddie v’s prime seafood seasons  and bahama breeze barington also wanted darden to consider putting its extensive real estate holdings— properties and another  ground leases—into a publicly traded real estate investment trust or reit barington argued that those steps would increase darden’s stock to between  and  per share far above its then price of  a few weeks later barington publicly announced that its investor group had accumulated a  stake in darden and reiterated the splitup planbefore it was a public company darden was a group of restaurant brands tucked inside food giant general mills at the urging of among others then general mills board member michael rose a former ceo of harrah’s entertainment the conglomerate spun off darden in  rose joined the darden board and remained on it until after smith’s coup d’état clarence otis a former investment banker at kidder peabody became ceo of darden in november  and presided over seven years of nearly continuous growth thanks to acquisitions and internal growth revenue increased to  billion in  from  billion in  “the stock was up  in  years” says rose of his full tenure on the board “that’s really good performance over a long period of time”but by  darden’s growth was hitting a wall samestore sales at olive garden red lobster and longhorn steakhouse had begun to stall in the years after the financial crisis as the lingering recession hit the company’s middleclass customers with full force after a respectable financial performance in  and revenue gains across the board at the end of the year darden announced downward revisions to its expected fiscal year  results the stock tumbled and the following year was indeed brutal for darden although revenue at olive garden increased by  million in  to  billion its samestore sales fell  most of the increase in revenue had come from higher menu prices at red lobster yearoveryear revenue actually decreased  million to  billion the company’s smaller fastergrowing chains continued to perform fine but darden’s overall ebitda—a measure of earnings key to assessing a company’s health—fell to  billion from  billion in  that was not the financial performance that wall street expected over the three years through the end of  darden’s stock gave shareholders a total return of  vs  for the sp the darden board knew that red lobster had become a problem and management believed that it would be difficult to fix “we had a company—red lobster—that had been facing tough times” says william lewis a managing director at advisory firm lazard and a longtime darden board member “i mean we had been dealing with this in the boardroom for six or seven years” still the market and the media could smell blood “darden needs shaking up and a split could be a logical move” barron’s concluded on nov  on dec  barington unloaded on darden using what has become standard practice among activist hedge fund managers the shockandawe powerpoint presentation in its page document released publicly barington reiterated much of what it had already told darden’s leadership team the company had underperformed its peers in nearly every way from samestore sales growth to stock performance barington said its reorganization plan would now create more value for shareholders than it had outlined previously a range of value between  and  per share was in the offing “we believe darden is undervalued and has the potential to deliver materially stronger returns for its shareholders” barington arguedtwo days later darden reacted to barington’s sixmonth assault with its own plan either to sell or to spin off red lobster to cut capital expenditures by  million and to reduce costs by some  million annually darden said it would maintain its attractive quarterly dividend of ¢ a share and would continue its plan to buy back stock which along with the dividends had returned more than  billion to shareholders over three years “after thorough and extensive consideration we have decided that the actions announced today best position us to enhance value for our shareholders” otis said darden’s stock fell about  on the newsrelatedharvardharvard’s cash cow investment fund is laying off half its staffharvardharvard’s cash cow investment fund is laying off half its staffsmith smelled an opportunity his various starboard funds had been buying and selling darden stock sporadically but after darden’s announcement on dec  starboard started a major accumulation that totaled  million shares or  of the stock smith filed starboard’s d on dec  he thought darden’s plan stank and said so he said that darden was “deeply undervalued” and that “starboard believes that the plan outlined by management falls significantly short of the actions required to maximize shareholder value” he agreed with barington that darden’s real estate holdings should be put in a separate publicly traded reit “starboard may make recommendations regarding corporate strategy capital allocation financial performance and board composition” smith wrote the stock spikedbut joining the fight with darden was more than just a moneymaking opportunity for smith it was a chance to burnish his brand as an activist investor he had already earned a reputation among fellow activists as having a talent for shaking up corporate boardrooms “starboard has certainly become one of the main goto firms in activist situations” says sahm adrangi the chief investment officer at hedge fund kerrisdale capital but even some of his fans felt that smith had something to prove “i would put him in the ‘arrogant punk’ category” says one hedge fund manager who has joined smith’s activist campaigns in the pastfor smith  the campaign

also the birthplace of steven a cohen the infamous hedge fund manager smith’s mother was a real estate broker and his father was the founder of the fresh juice co  after graduating from the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania in  with a degree in economics smith worked in the fledgling ma department of the big french bank société générale from there smith headed to his father’s company as vice president of strategic development and a member of the board in  at the younger smith’s initiation the smiths sold fresh juice to saratoga ­beverage for around  million jeff smith then moved to ­ramius capital a small hedge fund and private equity firm started by peter cohen a former ceo of shearson american express at ramius smith made direct investments in small publicly traded companies and ran an internal hedge fund after the financial crisis in  ramius merged with cowen group an investmentbanking firm that was once part of société ­générale in  smith and two of his partners spun starboard out of cowenstarboard started small in activism before working its way up to the big darden fight in  starboard won board seats on surmodics a biopharmaceutical company and on regis the nation’s largest operator of haircutting salons and the owner of hair club for men in december  smith took on a bigger target when he went after online media company aol he accused ceo tim armstrong of wasting money by funding the losses at patch a network of localnews websites smith wanted seats on the aol board but lost a proxy battle in june —one of his few defeats still he won the aol war armstrong ultimately spun off patch and as smith advocated aol agreed to return to shareholders much of the more than  billion it received from the sale of its patents to microsoft in  starboard which had accumulated a  stake in aol saw the value of its aol stock soar by about smith’s next corporate target was office depot in which he eventually accumulated a  stake he wanted ceo neil austrian removed and he pushed for the completion of office depot’s already announced merger with office max smith also wanted to appoint a majority of the board in the end office depot reached a compromise with smith and awarded starboard three board seats smith has also taken activist positions in smithfield foods calgon carbon and tessera technologies according to institutional investor the

control of the board in octobergraphic source sp capital iq  analee kasudiaunlike the board of office depot darden’s directors were not in a compromising mood when smith came calling lazard’s lewis says that the idea that barington and starboard suggested anything that the darden board wasn’t already aware of was laughable “we systematically analyzed everything that they suggested and more” he says lewis points out that he along with fellow board members mike rose and charles ledsinger the founder of sunbridge capital management had years of real estate experience “their thoughts about ways to unlock value made the starboard stuff look like gradeschool work” one board member says “there was just no way to in our judgment based on all the work we did give merit to any of their arguments” darden had already engaged goldman sachs to begin the sale process for red lobster and had appointed a fourmember subcommittee of the board—comprising lewis ledsinger rose and victoria harker the cfo of gannett—to oversee the process goldman contacted more than  potential buyers of red lobster and another  potential buyers of the real estate related to the chainstarboard however was not impressed by the darden board’s actions after speaking with otis and several of the other darden senior managers on jan   smith wrote the ceo a fivepage letter two weeks later and copied the board he also released the letter publicly in it he reiterated his view that spinning off red lobster as its own publicly traded company was a terrible idea no mention was made of the option to sell red lobster to a third party and that darden needed to explore the reit option he also returned to the idea of splitting darden into two companieson jan  the management team met with starboard at darden’s flashy headquarters in orlando at the meeting darden executives said they still planned to move forward with the spinoff or sale of red lobster again smith objected in a feb  letter also released publicly he wrote he was “surprised and terribly disappointed” by the management’s willingness to move ahead with the sale which was indicative of the board’s intention to ignore the “serious concerns” voiced by darden’s shareholders about “the potential destruction of shareholder value” smith also wrote that he had been in touch with darden’s other large shareholders and they shared his negative view about the sale or spinoff of red lobster he then threatened to mount a proxy fight to replace a majority of the board members at the  annual meeting in septemberit was becoming painfully obvious that the two sides were dug into their positions on feb  starboard filed a preliminary solicitation statement seeking to get a majority of shareholders to vote to hold a special meeting to try to thwart the sale of red lobster any vote held at the special meeting would be nonbinding and as wachtell lipton no doubt made clear the darden board was well within its legal rights to sell the business without shareholder approval but the message from shareholders would be resounding whether the board would hear it was another mattera former banker at kidder peabody darden ceo otis resigned in july after agreeing to sell red lobster to a private equity firm photo by phelan ebenhack—newscomrelatedinvestors guidethis is the real reason wall street should fear the ‘fiduciary rule’investors guidethis is the real reason wall street should fear the ‘fiduciary rule’the prospect of a shareholder vote on the red lobster sale had an understandably chilling effect on the sale process goldman was running potential bidders complained to goldman according to sec filings that “the uncertainty associated with a shareholder approval closing condition would be unacceptable” the very idea that shareholders might call a special meeting to register their displeasure with the sale was having the effect starboard wanted but darden and its board continued to plow ahead on march  darden filed a registration statement with the sec to begin the process of spinning off red lobster if that proved to be the preferred alternativelater in march the darden board met for two days to hear about the status of the various options being considered for red lobster at the meeting the board also enacted changes to its bylaws that many viewed as hostile to shareholders it delayed the annual meeting and made it tougher for shareholders to make changes the board claimed the moves were in keeping with what other companies do the activists and shareholderrights organizations such as glass lewis and iss were aghast “one has to wonder why the board chose this particular time to ‘modernize’ the bylaws by granting itself powers to obstruct or otherwise raising defenses against shareholders who might wish to use the annual meeting to hold directors accountable” iss later observed iss did not respond to a request for comment and glass lewis declined to comment for this article on march  darden management shortened its quarterly earnings call to  minutes the analyst and investor meeting scheduled for march  was canceled in response on march  starboard trotted out a slide powerpoint presentation making a detailed case for the special meetingby this time darden board members suspected that smith had enlisted the support of darden’s other big shareholders particularly that of greg wendt the san ­francisco–based manager of a fund at capital research darden’s largest shareholder and not a firm known for being activist “it was very clear that they were working hand and glove with starboard” says one former darden board member a spokesman for capital research says it is the company’s policy not to comment publicly about its investments former longtime darden board member mike rose says starboard developed a symbiotic relationship with the big institutional shareholders such as capital research “if capital re is unhappy capital re is not about to call up fidelity and say ‘we are unhappy’ because first of all they are competitors and second of all because that starts to violate sec rules” he says “they start to act as a group when they do that that requires filings so capital re can talk to starboard and starboard can talk to fidelity and it’s the same thing”on april  during the active passive investor summit in new york smith appeared on cnbc he said the spinoff of red lobster could cost shareholders as much as  billion between the lower multiple that he expected an independent red lobster to trade at and his belief that  million in real estate would be “trapped” there he said red lobster was struggling with high seafood prices and low customer volumes and should be kept by darden until a comprehensive strategic plan could be enacted asked whether clarence otis should be removed as ceo smith said “is mr otis in a hot seat i think he is in a hot seat” later that day cnbc reported that starboard had won  of the vote of darden shareholders to hold a special meeting which darden was now compelled to do within  days in the end starboard won  of the votefinal bids for red lobster came in toward the end of april and the board’s special committee huddled with goldman and morgan stanley for the first few weeks of may deciding what to do it turned out there was only one serious bidder for red lobster golden gate capital a san francisco–based private equity firm with  billion under management and the owner or former owner of such diverse businesses as california pizza kitchen ann taylor eddie bauer and pacific sunwearon may  smith appeared at the salt hedge fund conference in las vegas on a panel about activist investors he made the revealing point—as darden board members were all too aware—that the current age of activist investing had solidified the bonds between activist investors and traditional institutional investors “the institutionalshareholder base actually knows us collectively as activist investors far better than any one management team” he said “and frankly trusts us more that’s a big divergence than where it was five years ago  years ago  years ago” as for darden in particular smith estimated that his real estate plan for the company would unlock another  per share and his plan to improve operating margins—which he said were  basis points below industry averages—would create another  per share in value “there’s tremendous opportunity at darden” he said what he was having trouble fathoming is why the board and company were being so intransigent he said the spinoff or sale of red lobster was an “irrational” actjust a couple of days later on may  despite starboard’s victory in the vote for a special meeting the darden board voted unanimously to sell red lobster to golden gate for  billion in cash a multiple of nine times trailing month ebitda it was “a fucking great price” one board member says mike rose says golden gate’s purchase price was “ million more than our target price” after paying a capital gains tax of about  million darden intended to use  billion of the remaining proceeds to pay down debt and the balance to buy back its stock rose says the advisers told the board that if it postponed the sale they didn’t think the buyer would be there or the price would come down significantly “so the board i think did the absolutely right thing” he says darden also said it would file a proxy statement to begin the process of holding the special shareholder meeting as required even though it was a moot point a few days later smith wrote that the move “simply adds insult to injury” analysts seemed to agree with him “who knew lobsters had middle fingers” was the title of a research report by mark kalinowski at janney capital marketssmith was incensed “the announced sale woefully undervalues red lobster and its real estate assets” he said in a statement at the time he wrote in a subsequent letter to shareholders that the red lobster sale was a mere  million more than starboard had valued red lobster’s real estate alone “implying that darden is essentially giving away the red lobster operating business an iconic brand with  billion in sales for less than x ebitda”relatedjp morgan chasejp morgan chase earnings beat expectations but just missed a milestonejp morgan chasejp morgan chase earnings beat expectations but just missed a milestonerose says the board strongly disagreed with starboard’s analysis but felt its hands were tied on the pr front “as board members we took into account the longterm best interest of our shareholders even though our shareholders really didn’t understand that it was in their best interest and we couldn’t really tell them because we couldn’t communicate how bad red lobster was performing without screwing up our sale” he says “and so we made a very difficult decision we went ahead with the sale and from that day on the handwriting was on the wall that we were going to lose the entire board” the directors were like “the folks at the alamo” says rose “we knew what was coming but we decided to fight until the bitter end rather than give up”smith readied an allout assault in a page letter to his fellow shareholders on may  smith announced that starboard would begin a proxy fight to remove the darden board he also said that starboard had increased its ownership of the company to  ultimately starboard would end up with  of darden’s shares smith wrote that the board’s claim that it had sold red lobster for nine times ebitda was yet another example of the board’s and darden management’s “fundamental lack of understanding” of red lobster’s assets and their “predilection” to “mislead” shareholders golden gate capital had gotten red lobster for a bargain price smith claimed he wanted the full board replaced and named his  board nominees including himself and one of his partnersthe fight between smith and the darden board was verging on a holy war by now wendt of capital research told the directors that the fight had gone beyond a difference of opinion on strategy recalls one board member “he said ‘the shareholders asked for a vote and you told them to go fuck off and that to us is theology’ ” but the darden board was unmoved by starboard’s plan “we were like ‘we’re the board we know more than you do we have more information we have the best advisers’ ” recalls a board member and he says the board would make the same decisions again “if there was a headline it would be ‘we were right you are wrong’ ”during the summer and fall the parrying between darden and starboard continued on july  starboard sued darden in florida seeking access to confidential documents related to the sale of red lobster four days later darden completed the sale of red lobster to golden gate and announced that otis would step down as chairman and ceo darden also announced that charles ledsinger would be the new board chairman and that the roles of chairman and ceo would be split furthermore in an effort—finally—to compromise with smith who was expected to easily win the proxy fight darden proposed a slate of only nine directors implying that starboard could appoint the other threesmith however demanded more representation on the board and the two sides went back and forth arguing over the number of seats with wendt of capital research acting as an intermediary the board’s attempts to negotiate only spurred smith on for instance after smith suggested a fiftyfifty board split the board said it would think about it recalls one board member “when we got back to him to say ‘okay that might make some sense’ he was like ‘nope that offer is gone but what about this offer’ ” later wendt told the board that smith would accept eight of the  seats the majority of the directors voted for the compromise and informed wendt it would take the deal but when wendt called back recalls this board member he said “ ‘sorry he won’t do that anymore’ and so then we realized that capital re was also getting played by jeff smith” smith for his part says the board handled the negotiations poorly “they always wanted a proposal that was proposed a month earlier under different conditions” he saysat one point the sparring became comical tucked deep inside starboard’s nearly page powerpoint presentation on sept  was a gem about olive garden’s ongoing failure to salt the water used to cook its pasta “shockingly olive garden no longer salts the water it uses to boil the pasta merely to get a longer warranty on its pots” starboard wrote “we believe this results in a mushy unappealing product that is well below competitors’ quality despite similar cost” smith also wrote that darden could save between  million and  million a year on the cost of bread sticks—olive garden serves nearly  million bread sticks a year—and that they had lost their taste smith compared them to “hot dog buns” at that point the starboard vs darden fight went viral hbo’s john oliver did a threeminute takedown of the presentation on his show last week tonight that has now been viewed nearly  times on youtubewhen darden responded to the bread stick powerpoint soon after with a page “renaissance plan” about why shareholders should stay the course it was too little too late despite the support the darden plan received from some research analysts the vast majority of darden’s longterm shareholders had had enough both iss and glass lewis urged investors to vote for smith making the actual oct  vote a foregone conclusion shareholders voted overwhelmingly for smith and his slate of  directorssmith wasted little time in taking control on oct  he cut a deal with gene lee the darden president to become the interim ceo making effective immediately otis’s previously announced departure smith also threatened not to pay the fees of goldman morgan stanley and wachtell lipton but then thought better of it since the fees were contractual obligations on nov  lee announced a plan that would save darden about  million a year in costs by eliminating a level of senior management and by cutting darden’s privatejet operations and selling its corporate jet through the end of november darden’s stock was up about  since smith took control of the companywhile unapologetic about the board’s decisions former director rose acknowledges that the directors did not communicate effectively enough with the company’s large shareholders with better counsel from their highly paid advisers he says they might not have lost out to smith so absolutely bankers across wall street are conducting a thorough postmortem of what went wrong says rose “the next time a set of circumstances like this comes around believe me all the advisers are going to say ‘this could turn out like the darden case and you need to take that into consideration’ ”for his part former director lewis acknowledges smith’s skill as an activist “i give smith a lot of credit for his tactics his ability to tell stories his ability to connect with the shareholders” he says “as an activist he was brilliant” however board members felt that smith viewed the battle for darden as less about fixing the company and more about résumé building “we all very quickly realized that this was his audition for the big stage” one says the darden directors learned lessons about the need for boards to hear directly from a company’s biggest shareholders free of management filters “it’s a war” says one member of the board “it’s a war and so you don’t stop you just keep talking what are the lessons take control of your story don’t let someone else take control of your story”the fact that smith now controls the entire darden board is disturbing to some odland the former ceo of office depot who was nominated to be a darden director sees a bad precedent “as a ceo if i had put  of my friends on the board and said ‘in order for you to come on the board you must sign up for my plan and agree to that and then we’re going to take out the management together’ i think that would have been decried as really bad corporate governance by the governance community” he says “and yet in fact that’s what happened here and it’s being lauded as good corporate governance” that’s not to say that darden can’t be better run says odland or that the board didn’t make mistakes but the pendulum could swing too far toward activists says odland “what i worry about with the state of activism is that in fact corporate governance has gone from one set of people dominating a boardroom with very little objectivity to another set and both extremes can be equally as bad”smith dismisses those criticisms as misguided gripes he says the new board is “infinitely better” than the prior one and that working with activists should be simple for a board “all you have to do is what’s right for the company and for value” he says “that’s it listen to your shareholders they likely have good ideas and they’re the owners of the business” he says that his new board is working well with management and that he is “pleased with the attitude energy and teamwork inside the company”meanwhile smith has moved on to a new challenge on sept  before the ink was dry on the darden proxy fight smith sent a letter to marissa mayer the ceo of web giant yahoo two years ago third point’s dan loeb had pressed his ideas for yahoo on the company and had come away with little to show for it—other than installing mayer as ceo and the more than  billion in profit he made on yahoo stock now it’s smith’s turn he owns less than  of yahoo but wants mayer to sell yahoo’s stakes in alibaba and yahoo japan to cut costs by as much as  million a year and to stop buying tech startups that don’t add to earnings he would also like yahoo to merge with his old nemesis aol “a company we know well” as smith wrote on nov  smith reported in an sec filing that he had bought back into aol with a  stake fasten your seat beltswilliam d cohan is a
