tractor manufactures in the post war period with a major manufacturing plant at meltham west yorkshire england the company broke new ground which others were only to follow later but being a pioneering company ultimately lead to their downfall the fergusonbrown had a lot of innovative features including the use of cast alloy for many the components which was light but prone to damage the fergusonbrown used a coventry climax engine for the first  tractors browns developed their own engine which was fitted to subsequent production total production was    built from parts in  after production finished david brown  gaf ps tractor made around  brown and ferguson disagreed over tractor design details in the late s which led david brown to design his own version the vak in secret this was launched at the  royal show ferguson split away from brown and joined up with henry ford in  after a handshake agreement to allow his ferguson system threepoint linkage to be used on the fordson n tractors that agreement was eventually terminated by fords grandson in  and ferguson again split away to form ferguson tractors in  during the second world war browns new heavier tractor the vak was produced with over  units eventually sold making brown a wealthy man it is said the david brown tractor is the only one to be built onto a sturdy cast iron chassis where other makers bolt components together to form a chassisless construction which is weaker brown also built aircraft tugs vig for the royal air force and for pulling the bomb trolleys used to rearm aircraft these tugs
