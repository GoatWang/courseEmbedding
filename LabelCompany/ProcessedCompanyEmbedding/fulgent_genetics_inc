sensei longshort equity growth newsletter provider momentumstock senseisummaryfulgent genetics listed in september  and is seeking to disrupt the global market for genetic testing research suggest the genetic testing market is set to grow at over  pa between now and  fulgent had its first profitable quarter in december  with consensus earnings suggesting growth well over  for the next four quarters near term fulgent is expected to complete a strategic arrangement to further increase sales in china theme you dont have to have a crystal ball to know that healthcare is one sector that is set for continued future growth in the us alone the proportion of the population aged over  years is set to double by  with the growth in the market will come new and innovative companies looking to provide additional products and services to the sector fulgent genetics inc fulgent flgt is what you get when you combine genetics with the power of technology fulgent aims to increase the utilization of genetic testing in the marketplace by using its platform to reduce testing costs and increase the clinical usefulness of the data produced as of march   the companys test menu included approximately  gene panels that can collectively test for approximately  genetic conditions including various cancers cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders according to grandview research the size of the genetic testing market is estimated to have been approximately  billion in  of which approximately  billion was in the united states the global market is expected to reach approximately  billion by  a compound annual growth rate of  including approximately  billion in the united states who is behind fulgent ming hseih founded fulgent genetics in  and listed the business on the nasdaq in september  by way of background ming hseih was born in china and in  emigrated to the us to study engineering at the university of southern california in  he founded his first company amax information technologies before moving on in  to cofound cogent inc cogent inc grew to become a world leader in the  billion global biometric market with products such as automated fingerprintpalmprint identification systems used in law enforcement civil governmental agencies and commercial applications worldwide cogent inc listed in  at around  but struggled to generate consistent sales growth in the project based biometric market in  m nyse mmm came knocking and acquired cogent inc for  per share valuing the company at approximately  million at the time of the takeover cogent inc was generating around  million in annual revenue and employed approximately  people unique service proposition fulgent is positioned on the belief that the use of genetic testing in healthcare and diagnosis will become widespread according to fulgent the genetic testing industry has suffered two crucial shortcomings the tests are prohibitively expensive the test results lacked clinically actionable data fulgents business model is built on their technology platform which aims provide the highest level of clinically actionable data at a low cost per test fulgent claims to have a series of proprietary gene probes and reference libraries which when combined with their software and algorithms may well deliver them a competitive advantage a study conducted by the university of southern california usc showed that fulgents tests were almost twice as successful in identifying genetic mutations than unnamed competitors tests of course we have to bear in mind that usc is the alma mater of fulgents founder ming hseih accelerating earnings fulgent has demonstrated an ability to grow revenue quickly albeit from a low base becoming profitable for the quarter ended  december  consensus estimates are for fulgent to grow revenues at  or greater over the next four quarters with earnings per share expected to come in at  cents per share in march   cents per share in june   cents per shares in september  and  cents per share in december  well in the triple digit percentages fulgent is currently trading at  times  earnings which may prove conservative if fulgent can meet growth expectations if fulgent can demonstrate a track record of earnings growth the multiple investors are willing to pay to own shares will start to build pe expansion the other important point to note is that fulgent is already providing services globally as of december  international customers accounted for  of the total revenue of which china is a key contributor fulgent is working with xi long usa inc xi long to develop a strategic commercial relationship to pursue additional customers in china which the company expects to be finalized in the first half of  key risks fulgent is still in the emerging growth phase and therefore must now invest in sales and marketing to ensure the strong growth experienced to date can continue fulgent only started offering genetic testing commercially in  hence the operating history is limited two large customers contributed  each to total revenue in  so there is some sales risk to single customers fulgent must keep pace with rapid technological advances in the industry to ensure their business can remain viable and competitive founder ming hseihs previous business cogent inc was not a great success for the ipo investors buying  breakout fulgent listed in september  with the proceeds to be used to further expand the business management is committed to the business we like to invest in companies where management eat their own cooking with founder ming hsieh retaining around  of the outstanding shares in fulgent while other company insiders own a further  and strategic partner xi long inc holds around  as at  december   mutual and hedge funds owned an estimated  as at  december  and this looks set to continue to build over the next few quarters in terms of trading fulgent listed on  september  finishing the first days trading at  a slight premium to the  ipo price fulgent has since traded through an initial  day long ipo base before breaking out volume see arrows on chart to a high of  on the  january  fulgent is currently working through a nd stage consolidation base which thus far is of similar depth  to the original ipo base as breakout investors we want to see fulgent build the right side of the base pattern and breakout on volume above the previous high of  fulgent only trades around  shares per day hence further institutional buying should be easy to spot in the chart we expect to see more positive newsflow coming from fulgent in the next few weeks and months hence now is the time to add this stock to your watchlist and wait for the breakout disclosure i amwe are long flgt i wrote this article myself and
