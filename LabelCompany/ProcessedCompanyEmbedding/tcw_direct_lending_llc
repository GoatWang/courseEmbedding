 tcw direct lending tcw direct lending alternative products division in december  tcw purchased the special situations fund group ssf from regiment capital advisors lp an independent investment manager based in boston tcw direct lending is a senior secured lender that targets middle market companies with an emphasis on proprietary deal sourcing attractive riskadjusted returns and the preservation of capital it is overseen by a dedicated investment team led by year industry veteran rick miller investment team richard t miller john s balzer cfa james s bold ryan k carroll michael l coster mark gertzof suzanne grosso kyle p oneill karen e simeone david wang james d synborski alison c weiss performance  approach approach investment team news  commentary documents strategy the tcw direct lending strategy targets middle market companies and provides debt capital for a variety of needs including lbos refinancings acquisitions general growth liquidity and recapitalizations   many middle market borrowers don’t have access to the public fixed income and broadlysyndicated loan markets and must rely on conventional middle market banks and nonconventional debt providers like tcw direct lending for debt capital others simply require timely execution or a higher degree of certainty in closing   tcw direct lending typically can close a transaction more quickly than a conventional bank and the sourcing structuring and execution expertise of the tcw direct lending investment professionals allow tcw direct lending to commit to a financing providing greater certainty for the borrower  generally tcw direct lending does not participate in broadly syndicated transactions instead tcw direct lending professionals structure highly tailored instruments to meet the needs of borrowers these investments are typically senior secured obligations which rank higher than unsecured subordinated or mezzanine debt in the capital structure providing greater capital preservation for the fund’s limited partners  overview tcw direct lending partners with senior management teams financial intermediaries business owners assetbased lenders and financial sponsors to provide customized financing solutions  the tcw direct lending strategy can make individual investments up to approximately  million with typical investments ranging in size from  million to  million investments are normally structured as first or secondlien secured financings including unitranche structures in the unitranche structure tcw direct lending typically invests in conjunction with an assetbased lender who takes a firstlien firstout position on the collateral and provides tcw direct lending with a firstlien lastout position on the same collateral this structure provides a competitive edge for the senior bank lender—who with tcw direct lendings participation can offer to meet all of a company’s financing needs beyond the typical borrowing base formula—and a competitive interest rate for the borrower by presenting one rate to the borrower but reallocating the pricing between tcw direct lending and the bank the strategy is able to provide enhanced returns to its limited partners investment team the tcw direct lending team is a group of senior investment professionals all of whom have extensive capital market experience including transaction origination structuring negotiation due diligence and portfolio management in the public and private markets across a wide spectrum of securities and industries tcw direct lending has a track record of closing
