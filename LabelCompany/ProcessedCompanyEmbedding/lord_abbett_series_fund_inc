office of insurance products division of investment management at   end further info end preamble start supplemental information supplementary information following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained for a fee from the public reference branch of the sec  fifth street nw washington dc  tel   applicants representations  the fund is a maryland corporation that is registered under the  act as an openend management investment company the fund is a series fund currently comprised of four portfolios—bonddebenture portfolio growth and income portfolio international portfolio and midcap portfolio each portfolio is a separate series of the fund with one class of shares except the growth and income portfolio which has two classes of shares—variable contract class and pension class the fund may in the future offer additional series andor classes of shares  the adviser a new york partnership is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  and serves as the investment adviser for the fund  shares of the fund will be offered to separate accounts of participating insurance companies to serve as investment vehicles for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts including single premium scheduled premium modified single premium and flexible premium contracts collectively “variable contracts” these separate accounts either will be registered as investment companies under the  act or will be exempt from such registration  the participating insurance companies will establish their own separate accounts and design their own variable contracts each participating insurance company will have the legal obligation of satisfying all applicable requirements under the federal securities laws the role of the insurance products funds so far as the federal securities laws are applicable will be limited to that of offering their shares to separate accounts of participating insurance companies and to qualified plans and fulfilling any conditions the commission may impose upon granting the order requested herein each participating insurance company will enter into a fund participation agreement with the insurance products fund in which the participating insurance company invests  applicants state that shares of the insurance products funds also may be offered directly to qualified plans outside of the separate account context including without limitation those trusts plans accounts contracts or start printed page annuities described in sections a a b a b d b k and c of the internal revenue code of  as amended “code” and any other trust plan account contract or annuity that is determined to be within the scope of treasury regulation section fiii shares of the insurance products funds sold to qualified plans will be held where applicable by the trustees of such plans as required by section a of the employee retirement income security act of  “erisa”  additionally shares of a fund may be offered to the adviser or any of its affiliates for purposes of providing necessary capital required by section a of the  act or for other investment purposes in compliance with treasury regulation fii the return on shares of a fund purchased by the adviser or its affiliates will be computed in the same manner as for shares held by a separate account any shares of a fund purchased by such persons will be automatically redeemed if and when their investment advisory agreement with a fund terminates to the extent required to comply with applicable treasury regulations  the plans may choose one or more insurance products funds as the sole investment under the plan or as one of several investments plan participants may or may not be given the right to select among insurance products funds applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order pursuant to section c of the  act providing exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act and rules eb and etb thereunder to the extent necessary to permit shares of the insurance products funds to be offered and sold to and held by  variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same life insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company “mixed funding”  separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies including both variable annuity and variable life separate accounts “shared funding”  qualified pension and retirement plans outside the separate account context and  the adviser or any of its affiliates  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a unit investment trust rule eb provides partial exemptions from section a a a and b of the  act these exemptions are available only where all of the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies which offer their shares exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company therefore the relief granted by rule eb is not available if the scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account owns shares of a management investment company that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same insurance company or an affiliated insurance company mixed funding  the relief granted by rule eb also is not available if the scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account owns shares of an underlying management investment company that also offers its shares to separate accounts funding variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies shared funding furthermore because the relief under rule eb is available only where shares of the investment company are offered exclusively to separate accounts exemptive relief is necessary if the shares of the insurance products funds also are to be sold to qualified plans  in connection with the funding of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a unit investment trust rule etb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act these exemptions are available only where all of the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies which offer their shares exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company offering either scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts or flexible premium variable life insurance contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company therefore rule etb permits mixed funding for a flexible premium variable life insurance account under certain circumstances but does not permit shared funding  in addition because the relief under rule etb is available only where shares of the investment company are offered exclusively to separate accounts additional exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the insurance products funds also are to be sold to qualified plans  applicants state that current tax law permits the insurance products funds to increase their asset base through the sale of shares to plans section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable annuity and variable life contracts held by the portfolios of the insurance products funds the code provides that such contracts shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance contract for any period and any subsequent period during which the investments are not adequately diversified in accordance with regulations prescribed by the treasury department on march   the treasury department issued regulations treas reg section  which established diversification requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable annuity and variable life contracts the regulations provide that in order to meet the diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in an investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies however the regulations also contain certain exceptions to this requirement one of which permits shares of an investment company to be held by the trustee of a “qualified pension or retirement plan” as defined by revenue ruling  without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company also to be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable annuity and variable life contracts treas reg section fiii  applicants state that the promulgation of rules e and et preceded the issuance of these treasury regulations which made it possible for shares of an investment company to be held by a qualified plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company also to be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts thus applicants assert that given the then current tax law the sale of shares of the same investment company to separate accounts and plans could not have been envisioned at the time of the adoption of rules eb and etb  section a of the  act provides that it is unlawful for any company to act as investment adviser to or principal underwriter for any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification start printed page enumerated in sections a or  rules ebi and ii and etbi and ii provide partial exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management or administration of the underlying investment company  applicants state that the relief from section a provided by rules eb and etb in effect limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  applicants assert that it is not necessary to apply the provisions of section a of the  act to the many individuals who do not directly participate in the administration or management of the insurance products funds who are employed by the various unaffiliated insurance companies or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies that may utilize the insurance products funds as the funding medium for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts applicants do not expect the participating insurance companies to play any role in the management or administration of the insurance products funds thus applicants state that applying the restrictions of section a to individuals employed by participating insurance companies serves no regulatory purpose would increase monitoring costs incurred by participating insurance companies and therefore would reduce the net rates of return realized by variable contract owners  applicants submit that the reasons underlying the commissions grant of relief from section a will not be affected in any way by the proposed sale of the insurance products funds to qualified plans applicants state that the insulation of the insurance products funds from those individuals who are disqualified under the  act remains in place applicants further submit that since qualified plans are not investment companies and will not be deemed affiliated solely by virtue of their shareholdings no additional relief is necessary  rules ebiii and etbiii provide exemptions from the passthrough voting requirement with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are satisfied  rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners in connection with the voting of shares of an underlying investment company if such instructions would require such shares to be voted to cause an underlying investment company to make or refrain from making certain investments which would result in changes in the subclassification or investment objectives of such company or to approve or disapprove any contract between an investment company and its investment adviser when an insurance regulatory authority so requires rules ebiiib and etbiiib provide that the insurance company may disregard contract owners voting instructions with regard to changes initiated by the contract owners in the investment companys investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser under the rules voting instructions with respect to a change in investment policies may be disregarded only if the insurance company makes a good faith determination that such changes would a violate state law b result in investments that were not consistent with the investment objectives of the separate account or c result in investments that would vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment techniques used by other separate accounts of the company or of an affiliated life insurance company with similar investment objectives voting instructions with respect to a change in an investment adviser may be disregarded only if the insurance company makes a good faith determination that a the advisers fee would exceed the maximum rate that may be charged against the separate accounts assets b the proposed adviser may be expected to employ investment techniques that vary from the general techniques used by the current adviser or c the proposed adviser may be expected to manage the investment companys investments in a manner that would be inconsistent with its investment objectives or in a manner that would result in investments that vary from certain standards  as indicated above shares of the insurance products funds sold to qualified plans will be held where applicable by the trustees of such plans as required by section a of erisa section a also provides that the trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of the plan with two exceptions a when the qualified plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the plan and not contrary to erisa and b when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the qualified plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa unless one of the two exceptions stated in section a applies the qualified plan trustees have exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies where a named fiduciary appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary the qualified plans may have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the qualified plans in their discretion some of the qualified plans however may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from plan participants  where a qualified plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants do not see any potential for irreconcilable material conflicts of interest between or among variable contract holders and plan participants with respect to voting of the respective insurance products funds shares accordingly applicants state that unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with respect to qualified plans since the plans are not entitled to passthrough voting privileges  applicants state that even if a qualified plan were to hold a controlling interest in an insurance products fund the applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such insurance products fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in an insurance products fund by a qualified plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding  where a plan provides participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants state that the start printed page purchase of shares by such qualified plans does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  applicants state that there is no contractual or other relationship between the participating insurance companies and any qualified plans which for example would affect the solvency of the life insurers affect the performance of the life insurers contractual obligations or would be expected to increase the risks undertaken by the life insurer accordingly applicants state that unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of resolution of irreconcilable material conflicts with respect to voting is not present with respect to any of the qualified plans  applicants state that no increased conflict of interest would be presented by the granting of the requested relief applicants submit that shared funding does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several states in this regard applicants note that when different participating insurance companies are domiciled in different states it is possible that the state insurance regulatory body in a state in which one participating insurance company is domiciled could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other insurance regulators in one or more other states in which other participating insurance companies are domiciled applicants assert however that this possibility is no different or greater than exists when a single insurer and its affiliates offer their insurance products in several states as is currently permitted  applicants state that affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators the affected insurer may be required to withdraw its separate accounts investment in the relevant insurance products funds  applicants also assert that affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to when a participating insurance company could disregard variable contract owner voting instructions the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements that disregarding voting instructions be reasonable and based on specified good faith determinations however if the participating insurance companys decision to disregard variable contract owner voting instructions represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote approving a particular change such participating insurance company may be required at the election of the relevant insurance products fund to withdraw its separate accounts investment in that insurance products fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed upon the variable contract owners as a result of such withdrawal  applicants submit that there is no reason why the investment policies of an insurance products fund with mixed funding would or should be materially different from what those policies would or should be if such insurance products fund or series thereof funded only variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts the insurance products funds will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of insurance product regardless of the types of insurance products fund shareholders a funds adviser is legally obligated to manage the fund in accordance with the funds investment objectives policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by the funds board  applicants submit that no one investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular insurance product or to a plan each pool of variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status age insurance and investment goals a fund supporting even one type of insurance product must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers applicants submit that permitting mixed and shared funding will provide economic support for the continuation of the insurance products funds in addition mixed and shared funding also will facilitate the establishment of additional series of insurance products funds serving diverse goals  as noted above section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable annuity and variable life contracts held in the portfolios of management investment companies treasury regulation section fiii which established diversification requirements for such portfolios specifically permits among other things “qualified pension or retirement plans” and insurance company separate accounts to share the same underlying investment company therefore applicants assert that neither the code nor the treasury regulations nor the revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if the qualified plans variable annuity separate accounts and variable life insurance separate accounts all invest in the same management investment company  applicants do not see any greater potential for irreconcilable material conflicts arising between the interests of plan participants under the qualified plans and owners of the variable contracts issued by the separate accounts of participating insurance companies from possible future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions are taxed for variable annuity contracts variable life insurance contracts and plans these differences do not raise any conflicts of interest when distributions are to be made and a separate account of the participating insurance company or qualified plan is unable to net purchase payments to make distributions the separate account or qualified plan will redeem shares of the insurance products funds at their respective net asset values the qualified plan then will make distributions in accordance with the terms of the plan and the participating insurance company will make distributions in accordance with the terms of the variable contract  applicants submit that the ability of the insurance products funds to sell their respective shares directly to qualified plans does not create a “senior security” as such term is defined under section g of the  act with respect to any variable contract owner as opposed to a participant under a qualified plan “senior security” is defined under the  act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends” as noted above regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under the qualified plans or variable contract owners under their variable contracts the qualified plans and the separate accounts of participating insurance companies have rights only with respect to their respective shares of the insurance products funds they only can redeem such shares at their net asset value no shareholder of any of the insurance products funds has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends start printed page   applicants submit that there are no conflicts between the variable contract owners and the plan participants with respect to state insurance commissioners veto powers over investment objectives applicants note that the basic premise of shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power to prevent among other things insurance companies indiscriminately redeeming their separate accounts out of one fund and into another timeconsuming complex transactions must be undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers on the other hand trustees of or plan participants in qualified plans can quickly redeem shares from insurance products funds and reinvest in other funding vehicles without the same regulatory impediments or as in the case with most qualified plans even hold cash or other liquid assets pending suitable alternative investment applicants maintain that even if there should arise issues where the interests of variable contract owners and the interests of participants in qualified plans conflict the issues can be almost immediately resolved because the trustees of the plans can on their own redeem shares out of the insurance products funds  applicants state that various factors have hindered insurance companies from offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts applicants submit that mixed and shared funding should provide several benefits to variable contract owners by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds participating insurance companies will benefit not only from the investment and administrative expertise of the adviser and the subadvisers but also from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a larger pool of assets mixed and shared funding also would permit a greater amount of assets available for investment by the insurance products funds thereby promoting economies of scale by permitting increased safety through greater diversification and by making the addition of new series more feasible applicants assert that therefore making the insurance products funds available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts and this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges to investors applicants further note that the sale of shares of the insurance products funds to plans also can be expected to increase the amount of assets available for investment by the insurance products funds and thus promote economies of scale and greater diversification  applicants assert that there is no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts historically have been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds which have not been affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account applicants do not believe that mixed and shared funding and sales to qualified plans will have any adverse federal income tax consequences applicants conditions applicants have consented to the following conditions  a majority of each insurance products funds board of trustees or directors each a “board” will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” thereof as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death disqualification or bona fide resignation of any board member then the operation of this condition will be suspended a for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application  each insurance products funds board will monitor their respective funds for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between and among the interests of the variable contract owners of all separate accounts and of plan participants and qualified plans investing in the insurance products funds and determine what action if any should be taken in response to such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including a an action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretive letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities c an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding d the manner in which the investments of the funds are being managed e a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners variable life insurance contract owners or trustees of the plans f a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of variable contract owners or g if applicable a decision by a qualified plan to disregard the voting instructions of plan participants  any participating insurance company and any qualified plan that executes a fund participation agreement upon becoming an owner of  of more of the assets of an insurance products fund collectively “participants” and the adviser or any other investment adviser of an insurance products fund will report any potential or existing conflicts to the board of any relevant insurance products fund the adviser or any other investment advisers of an insurance products fund and the participants will be obligated to assist the appropriate board in carrying out its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised this responsibility includes but is not limited to an obligation by each participating insurance company to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard variable contract owner voting instructions and if passthrough voting is applicable an obligation by each qualified plan to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard plan participant voting instructions the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the boards will be contractual obligations of all participating insurance companies and qualified plans investing in the insurance products funds under their respective agreements governing participation in the insurance products funds and such agreements shall provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of variable contract owners and if applicable plan participants  if a majority of an insurance products funds board members or a majority of the disinterested board members determine that a material irreconcilable conflict exists the relevant participating insurance companies and qualified plans at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested board members will take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict including a start printed page withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the separate accounts from the insurance products fund or any of its series and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium which may include another series of
