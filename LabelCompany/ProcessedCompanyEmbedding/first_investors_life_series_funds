grade target maturity  target maturity  target maturity  value annual report december   market overview first investors life series fund dear investor we are pleased to present this market overview of the annual report for the first investors life series fund for the year ended december   the economy the economy recovering from the  recession grew at a modest  pace over the past  months although the unemployment rate rose to  the consumer sector accounted for most of the economys growth assisted by an extremely positive interest rate environment the lowest mortgage rates in  years spurred record new home sales and mortgage refinancings the latter of which increased consumers discretionary income zeropercent auto financing helped boost retail sales  in  inflation was benign as the consumer price index cpi an inflation benchmark rose only  during the year in contrast to the consumer sector the business sector was weak while lower prices benefited the consumer they did not help businesses despite improved earnings due to increased productivity lack of revenue growth and geopolitical uncertainty discouraged capital investment and hiring industrial production increased only  yearoveryear and manufacturing payrolls declined by  employees the federal reserve kept monetary policy unchanged until november when it surprised the market by lowering the federal funds rate from  to  in response to continued slow economic growth the substantial republican victory in the midterm elections in november increased market expectations for a fiscal stimulus proposal from the bush administration in early  the equity market despite a fourth quarter rally the equity market posted disappointing results during  in fact the month period was the worst year for the standard  poors  index since  and the first time since before us involvement in world war ii that the stock market posted negative returns for a third consecutive year many factors converged to hold back stock performance including the sluggish rate of economic growth corporate governance and accounting scandals and tensions with iraq and north korea given the high level of uncertainty all broad market indexes were negative for the period with the standard  poors  index down  and the dow jones industrial average off  most business sectors were down for the period with the information technology telecommunications and utilities sectors among the worst performers the materials and consumer staples sectors were rare bright spots the technology benchmark the nasdaq composite lost  of its value market overview continued first investors life series fund although all market capitalization sectors were in negative territory the midcap sector did somewhat better than the smallcap and largecap sectors on the international front most developed markets posted negative returns the bond market in general the bond market posted strong results in  the primary factors that impacted the market were a substantial decline in interest rates due to the sluggish economy low inflation the weak stock market and geopolitical instability in particular terrorism and iraq the bond market experienced a substantial rally during the reporting period as interest rates declined significantly for example the twoyear treasury note yield began the period at  and ended the period at  and the year treasury note yield dropped from  to  in early october treasury yields fell to their lowest levels since the s before rising slightly later in the fourth quarter driven by this substantial decline in interest rates the lehman aggregate bond market index was up  among the sectors of the bond market us government securities had the highest return as the lehman us government index increased by  government securities benefited from their high credit quality and liquidity and were seen as a safe haven investment grade corporate bonds were the second best performing sector as the lehman corporate index increased by  the returns of corporate bonds varied substantially by issuer and credit rating higher quality bonds substantially outperformed those of lower credit quality mortgagebacked securities also posted solid performance as the lehman mortgagebacked index was up  this sector benefited from high credit ratings and relatively high yields although the record number of mortgage refinancings held returns back high yield bonds posted disappointing results as the lehman high yield index was down  the highly indebted companies in this sector were particularly vulnerable to the subpar economic recovery weak stock market and corporate governance issues looking ahead the economy remains sluggish despite substantial monetary  and likely fiscal  stimulus the probability of war with iraq appears high and north korea is a new source of tension these factors have combined to keep interest rates near historically low levels the year  began with great uncertainty but renewed economic growth or successful resolution of geopolitical issues would likely result in higher interest rates and lower bond prices for the stock market with equity valuations at more reasonable levels and the scandals of corporate malfeasance now largely passed stocks may benefit if the economy grows moderately as always investors are best served by a welldiversified portfolio and a longterm commitment because it is impossible to predict the future direction of the markets particularly over the short term there are certain basic investment principles that we encourage our clients to follow to reduce exposure to risk first we encourage clients to take a longterm view and to avoid trying to time the market attempting to time the market is extremely difficult even for professional investors second we encourage our clients to diversify their portfolios among stock funds bond funds and money market funds third we encourage our clients to follow a regular investment plan investing a specific amount of money at defined intervals this strategy is known as dollar cost averaging it may help you to avoid getting caught up in the excitement of a rising market and will reduce the risk of buying at high points of course no financial plan or program no matter how well designed is guaranteed to be successful in addition nothing eliminates the risk associated with overall market trends however utilizing these various strategies may help to minimize the risk by reducing the extent to which an investor may be affected by a decline in any one security or segment of the market its important to note that systematic investment programs like dollar cost averaging do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets these types of plans involve regular investment in securities regardless of fluctuating price levels investors should consider their financial ability to continue purchases through periods of low price levels market overview continued first investors life series

variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts issued by first investors life insurance company the reports do not reflect the additional expenses and charges that are applicable to variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts  there are a variety of risks associated with investing in all variable life and annuity subaccounts for the stock subaccounts the risks include market risk the risk that the entire stock market will decline because of an event such as a deterioration in the economy or a rise in interest rates as well as special risks associated with investing in certain types of stock subaccounts such as smallcap global and international subaccounts for bond subaccounts the risks include interest rate risk and credit risk interest rate risk is the risk that bonds will decrease in value as interest rates rise as a general matter longerterm bonds fluctuate more than shorterterm bonds in reaction to changes in interest rates credit risk is the risk that bonds will decline in value as the result of a decline in the credit rating of the bonds or the economy as a whole or that the issuer will be unable to pay the interest andor principal when due you should consult your prospectus for a precise explanation of the risks associated with your subaccounts  mr miska became the director of equities on april   portfolio managers letter first investors life blue chip fund dear investor for the year ended december   the funds return on a net asset value basis was  during the period the fund declared dividends from net investment income of  cents per share the general downturn of the stock market was particularly difficult for large capitalization stocks holdings in a number of sectors were not beneficial to the funds performance health care companies suffered from negative sentiment as well as stockspecific issues positions in pfizer and merck did not perform well due to concerns about their drug pipelines the funds holdings in tenet healthcare hurt performance significantly as the stock price fell substantially due to investigations regarding improper billing of government programs many stocks within the consumer discretionary sector were hurt by overall concerns regarding consumer debt levels these concerns were particularly acute for largecap stocks holdings in this sector such as home depot and sears hurt performance technology sectors were generally weak due to doubts regarding future growth potential holdings in these sectors were disappointing across the board with intel motorola and cisco being major underachievers shares in the financial sector performed poorly as concerns about debt loads and the financial health of customers plagued consumeroriented names such as capital one financial citigroup and mbna despite the downturn the fund was able to benefit from holdings in several sectors investments in the traditionally defensive consumer staples sector such as anheuserbusch cocacola and kroger held up fairly well the materials sector benefited from improved commodity pricing and the fund was helped by its overweight position in newmont mining in the gold sector selected holdings in the utilities sector held up well specifically defensive industries and companies without trading exposure such as consolidated edison selected stocks of firms in the telecommunications services helped performance as the fund held shares of several regional bells throughout the reporting period the funds sectorneutral stance relative to the sp  hurt performance as it was unable to fully participate in rallies in certain sectors effective december   the funds sectorneutral mandate has been lifted empowering the fund to take overweight or underweight sector positions this will give the fund greater flexibility in pursuing its objective of high total investment return consistent with preservation of capital portfolio managers letter continued first investors life blue chip fund thank

maintained a  net asset value per share throughout the year the life series cash management fund continued to pursue its objectives by investing conservatively in shortterm instruments considered to present minimal credit risk at the time of purchase shortterm interest rates remained generally stable for much of last year albeit at their lowest levels in decades though the economy improved marginally in  manufacturing remained weak equity prices continued to be depressed the unemployment rate rose and global political uncertainties increased consequently the fed was compelled to lower shortterm interest rates in november from  to  the fund invested a large portion of its assets in us government and agency securities over the last year in an effort to mitigate credit risk in the portfolio the fund also invested large portions of its assets in securities issued by domestic corporations and banks as corporate credit quality deteriorated however the fund increased its diversification of nongovernment issuers in addition to limiting exposure the fund also began to limit its investments in nongovernment issuers to those with shorter maturities the fund maintained a weighted average maturity that was longer than its peer group average through most of the last year which benefited performance though interest rates were low and stable the yield curve remained positively sloped during most of the period and offered opportunities for incremental return by investing in securities with longer maturities the fund also effectively used corporate bonds and notes for incremental return in addition to floating rate securities and various types of callable securities the fund will continue to purchase only those securities that it believes present minimal credit risk to its shareholders in addition the fund is likely to maintain a large percentage of its assets in us government and agency obligations while maintaining additional constraints on investments in corporate debt the fund is also likely to maintain a weighted average maturity that is close to that of its peers money market funds remained an integral part of the financial markets in  continuing

to financial statements portfolio managers letter first investors life discovery fund dear investor for the year ended december   the funds return on a net asset value basis was  the primary factors driving the funds performance were the sluggish economy the overall decline of the stock market and the generally disappointing performance of the smallcap growth stock sector at the start of  the fund shifted to overweight positions in the industrial and consumer cyclical sectors and underweight positions in the technology and health care sectors these moves helped the fund as industrial and consumer cyclical stocks held up fairly well while stocks in the technology and health care sectors tumbled through the first half of  starting in the summer the fund increased its holdings in the health care sector to an overweight position and boosted its holdings in the financial sector while reducing holdings in the consumer discretionary sector in the fourth quarter the fund moved closer to a market neutral position in the technology sectors and reduced holdings in the defensive health care sector a strong rally in the final months of the year did help mitigate some of the damage inflicted earlier in the year two technology holdings that hurt the fund were retek a supply chain software supplier to retailers and aeroflex a networking communications provider both firms were harmed by a cutback in technology spending in the health care arena province healthcare an operator of rural hospitals and enzon pharmaceuticals a drug discovery company were poor performers in general the funds underweight position in technology stocks for most of the year helped performance several consumer cyclical stocks posted good results such as chicos fas a specialty retailer that offers womens clothing another area that helped the fund was the financial sector where smaller regional companies posted solid returns such as doral financial a mortgage bank going forward the fund will continue to seek out highquality smaller companies that have strong active management teams solid financial fundamentals profitable product niches and aboveaverage growth potential portfolio

the year mortgage rate fell to  and rising property prices to refinance outstanding mortgages in this environment lowercoupon mortgagebacked bonds generally outperformed highercoupon mortgagebacked bonds also while mortgagebacked bonds had relatively high returns nonmortgagebacked bonds  such as us treasury securities  had higher returns at the beginning of  the funds composition was  mortgagebacked bonds  us treasury and agency notes and  in cash equivalents the fund benefited during the year from its relatively high percentage of assets in intermediate maturity us agency notes

versus a year ago and sp operating earnings rose  we expect similar growth rates in  the consumer has been the mainstay of growth but support from this sector is expected to be moderate going forward over the past few months spending has been helped by record cashouts from mortgage refinancing going forward however we expect a slow employment recovery geopolitical concerns and higher oil prices to slow spending gains a stronger job market later in  should set the stage for stronger consumption in  we are hopeful that accommodative monetary policies and the ongoing improvement in corporate balance sheets will improve the growth environment in  the funds performance for the year was driven not only by the overall equity markets but also by some negative stock selection most notably in the telecommunication services and consumer staples sectors however our sector allocation was positive for the year and served to partially offset the impact of stock selection we were appropriately underweight in the poorperforming telecommunication services sector which declined  for the year in fact this underweight position represented the largest positive sector contribution to the funds performance nevertheless one of our telecommunication services holdings was worldcom and the negative impact of this holding largely counteracted the positive effect gained by underweighting the

for the year ended december   the funds return on a net asset value basis was  during the period the fund declared dividends from net investment income of  cents per share macroeconomic factors that contributed to the funds performance during the fiscal year were the pace of economic recovery the prospect of war and a flight to quality by investors the lack of sustainability of the economic recovery cut short the corporate profit cycle and concerns about a double dip recession caused a reduction in corporate investment the prospect of war with iraq and its effect on oil prices throughout the year hurt the profitability of many industrial companies the seemingly endless stream of corporate fraud announcements and the resulting market volatility shattered investor confidence reflecting these concerns the yield spread between high yield bonds and treasuries reached its widest level since the early s recession given the bearish market environment market participants shifted their profiles based on their appetite for risk asset classes perceived as less risky ie us treasuries high quality investment grade corporate bonds and governmentbacked mortgage securities were the best performers in fiscal year  the riskiest asset classes such as equities suffered steep losses the highyield market was between these extremes in this environment the main contributor to fund performance was its defensive positioning our view entering  was that the economic recovery would be slower than the market consensus therefore the fund took overweight positions in defensive industries such as cable television diversified media and health care diversified media was one of the top performing sectors in  and health care also outperformed the market our attempt to position the fund defensively did not work perfectly however the cable television sector traditionally a defensive play was the worst performing sector in the high yield market in  nonetheless our strategy overall was successful and aided fund performance other factors that positively contributed to the funds performance were overweight positions in the energy and transportation sectors the energy sector continued to perform well due to strong oil and gas prices the transportation sector was helped by strong automotive sales an underweight position in the utilities sector helped performance as this sector suffered from the fallout from enron and overcapacity as newly constructed power plants drove down power prices by contrast underweight positions in the gamingleisure and financial services sectors hurt performance as both sectors outperformed the market given our view entering  that the economic recovery would be slower than the market consensus we were surprised that the gamingleisure sector which relies on discretionary spending by consumers outperformed the market corporate defaults were also an important factor in the performance of the fund and the high yield market in general moodys issuerweighted default rate for speculative grade bonds ended november  at  down from a peak of  in january  the good news was that the default rate fell nine out of eleven months in  on the flip side portfolio managers letter continued first investors life high yield fund the default rate was at a higher level for a longer period of time than in previous years moodys forecasting model predicts that the default rate will finish  near  moodys month forecast indicates that the default rate will continue to trend downward towards  by the end of the fourth quarter of  a  default rate though is still approximately double the historical default rate looking to  we are cautiously optimistic the us economy seems to be in a lowgrowth lowinflation environment while this will make it difficult for high yield issuers to grow out of their debts productivity gains and low interest rates do allow some room for deleveraging additionally low dollar prices on existing bonds combined with a declining default rate are bullish for our market on the negative side geopolitical uncertainty looms large the biggest risk to our outlook is on the geopolitical front where the escalation of hostilities in the middle east or elsewhere can trigger a flight of capital out of risky asset classes in addition the recent run up in oil prices due to the iraqi situation and the strike by workers at pdvsa venezuelas stateoperated energy company have hurt the profitability of industrial companies and may lower business investment in the near term in the longer run if a

dear investor for the year ended december   the funds return on a net asset value basis was  during the period the fund declared dividends from net investment income of  cents per share global equity markets declined in  for the third year in a row as investors struggled to find good news amidst an environment characterized by economic malaise geopolitical turmoil corporate scandals and continued fears over the war on terrorism the market reaction to these fears peaked at the end of september and early october with the third quarter ending as one of the worst in recent memory investors returned to the equity markets in the fourth quarter resulting in the second best quarter for global equity markets in the last three years for the year our stock selection in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors as well as the overweight position in the materials sector contributed positively to the funds performance the biggest detractors from performance were stock selection in the industrial and financial sectors and our underweight position in consumer staples we also benefited from our overweight position in japan and our decreased exposure to the us in the second half of  we modestly increased our holdings in the technology financial and materials sectors as we felt that the market had become overly pessimistic about the prospects for many of these stocks and that they had become attractively priced these changes in the portfolio had a significant impact on performance in the second half of the year and made it possible for us to recover some of the ground we lost earlier in the year our global economic outlook remains unchanged we continue to expect that economic growth over the next year will be quite modest in comparison to prior recoveries as economies around the globe recover from the excesses of the s within this environment we favor the telecommunications services sector as companies continue to cut debt reduce spending shed unnecessary assets and focus on their core businesses we continue to like selected names in the technology sector as growth expectations remain relatively modest looking into  we will look to trim our holdings in the consumer discretionary sector due to slower consumer spending and will have underweight positions in the energy and industrials sectors from a regional perspective we have become more favorably disposed towards the us over europe the us is being aggressive on both the monetary and fiscal fronts and looks likely to see improving growth before continental europe with regard to the uk we believe that the economy will face a consumer slowdown once the housing boom cools down emerging markets may be the most interesting this year particularly in asia where they have respectable domestic

declared dividends from net investment income of  cents per share the funds performance was driven mainly by the sluggish economic recovery the falling interest rate environment avoidance of the brunt of corporate scandals and decisive management when our portfolio encountered credit problems as is often the case the key issues that defined these twelve months were very different from what the world expected as the year began immediately after the terrorist attacks in  there were widespread expectations of a significant economic contraction after all economic activity had been decelerating before the cataclysmic event and much equity value had evaporated in the immediate aftermath however several policies prevented this from happening instead we saw a surprisingly steady macroeconomic picture thanks to monetary support and a rally in the treasury market with both fiscal stimulus and falling interest rates capital markets began  with some confidence however some unfinished business from the buoyant period of the late s to  had accumulated apart from usual companyspecific challenges some large and formerly favored sectors had begun to stumble even after benefiting from a very aggressive investing climate as they did so it became apparent that problems deeper than those of management strategy and execution had occurred telecommunications technology deregulated utilities and energy trading had been promising but faced some real practical problems as  unfolded enron filed for bankruptcy protection late in  the rot that was found to underlie that company created very profound implications for corporate financing governance and investor confidence throughout  in several situations the accounting profession a basic part of the infrastructure of the financial system became suspect hurting private sector capital markets confidence suffered badly as a number of incidents in close succession caused markets to become very negative which hurt valuations and the trading liquidity of corporate bonds during the year bond rating agencies became especially eager to bolster their credibility markets correctly anticipated that this defensiveness would affect vulnerable credits most severely a chain of events started as several borderline issuers were downgraded to below investment grade and lost their access to the commercial paper market as they were forced to resort to bank backup lines of credit a widespread move to extend debt maturities ensued putting further pressure on corporate bonds in general other abuses became known for example when accounting fraud at worldcom was reported that disclosure destroyed that companys finances hurt the telecom sector scarred many corporate bond investors and generally harmed the corporate bond sector positive returns for much of  were due to declining treasury yields rather than good news from the credit front despite all the negative events of the early part of  corporate bonds rallied in the fourth quarter as they became perceived as being undervalued catalysts were the federal reserves reduction of shortterm interest rates and the announcement of the acquisition of a portfolio managers letter continued first investors life investment grade fund large widely held but troubled finance issuer  household finance  by the managerially and financially strong hsbc in a year that became defined by event risk the fund did well success came from a few rather basic sources the funds diversified portfolio was distributed across many industries and companies in the aftermath of september th economically cyclical industries such as automotive retail and manufacturing surprised everyone with their resilience and their bonds outperformed for much of the year most recently as economic growth slowed some of these holdings have given back some of their earlier gains defensive industries such as consumer nondurables food and food retailing performed their missions within the fund although market competition was intense in virtually all categories and allowed for few credit upgrades real estate investment trusts many of which we bought last year have proven resilient and are widely regarded as being good investments in a slowing economy the negative performers were concentrated in a couple of deregulated industries telecommunications and diversified energy companies here the effects of difficult competition were compounded by corporate wrongdoing regulatory responses within industries companyspecific problems and a virtual stampede of sellers when bad news occurs all combined to hurt many bonds this past year we have been well served by often being among the earlier sellers when bonds held in the fund encountered difficulties looking ahead much of the outlook is colored by the uncertainty about the war on terrorism and the probability of war with iraq the range of potential outcomes is wide the drag on the economy caused by these uncertainties could persist worsen or be removed regardless of the direction in which the economy and the market move the fund will continue to seek out investment grade corporate bonds that represent solid values thank you for

income of  cents  cents and  cents per share respectively the funds investment objective is to seek a predictable compounded return for investors who hold the funds until maturity in order to meet this objective the funds are fully invested in highquality zero coupon bonds these bonds are very sensitive to changes in interest rates the primary factor affecting the performance of the funds was a large decline in interest rates during  this decline resulted in substantial total returns for the target maturity funds reflecting the fact that longer maturity bonds are more sensitive to changes in interest rates the target maturity  fund had the lowest return while the target maturity  had the highest return thank you for making the life target maturity funds part of your investment strategy as

dividends from net investment income of  cents per share effective december   the fund was changed into a general value fund that focuses on total return and does not concentrate in utilities or any other sector therefore the funds name has changed from the life utilities income fund to the life value fund the transition of its holdings began in december since the fund operated as the life utilities income fund in  it was subject to the utilities sectors harsh climate it was a difficult year as the electric gas and telecommunications industries all produced negative returns shareholders may wonder why a historically stable sector of the stock market has performed so poorly over the past couple of years headline issues such as the california energy crisis power and natural gas market manipulation and the alleged accounting fraud at companies like enron and worldcom tell only part of the tale a big reason for the increased volatility in the sector is the deregulation activity that has occurred over the last several years business risk has increased as companies in each of the three major utilities subsectors have had to adjust to a more competitive environment in recent years many utilities management teams invested capital in unregulated businesses in an effort to enhance their growth prospects several electric and gas utilities built or bought unregulated power plants and engaged in extensive power and gas trading operations subsequently the power generation market suffered from oversupply the trading business has all but evaporated due to increased credit risk a lack of a solid regulatory framework and in some cases the unethical behavior of market participants the telecommunications industry has had its own share of difficulties fierce competition has continued to take its toll on long distance and wireless companies even the regional bells have been humbled a weak economy erased earnings growth while wireless substitution and competition from highspeed cable modems have nibbled away at the bells stable local franchise going forward the new investment objective of the fund will result in reduced sector risk and increased flexibility to adjust to tough market conditions the fund will maintain its focus on dividendpaying companies thank you for making the life value fund part of your investment strategy as always we appreciate the

the mean between the last bid and asked prices prior to the time when assets are valued based upon quotes furnished by a market maker for such securities securities may also be priced by a pricing service the pricing service uses quotations obtained from investment dealers or brokers information with respect to market transactions in comparable securities and other available information in determining value shortterm debt securities that mature in  days or less are valued at amortized cost securities for which market quotations are not readily available and other assets are valued on a consistent basis at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the supervision of the life series funds officers in the manner specifically authorized by the board of trustees of the life

purposes where applicable quotations of foreign securities in foreign currencies are translated to us dollar equivalents using the foreign exchange quotation in effect the cash management fund values its portfolio securities in accordance with the amortized cost method of valuation under rule a under the  act amortized cost is an approximation of market value of an instrument whereby the difference between its acquisition cost and value at maturity is amortized on a straightline basis over the remaining life of the instrument the effect of changes in the market value of a security as a result of fluctuating interest rates is not taken into account and thus the amortized cost method of valuation may result in the value of a security being higher or lower than its actual market
