parfitt june   world marijuana news banks still don’t want to work with legally operating marijuana businesses because marijuana is still federally illegal but cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin can solve transaction issues for marijuana businesses the digital currency helps prevent these businesses from having large amounts of cash onhand in  the legal marijuana industry was valued at  billion according to bloomberg by  the industry could be worth around  billion bitcoin services like posabit and singlepoint inc are helping marijuana users use this digital currency to purchase recreational and medical marijuana john baugher cofounder of posabit said “there’s no industry – whether it’s the production and sale of cannabis or the production and sale of a cup of coffee – that can operate safely transparently or effectively without access to banks or other financial institutions and traditional services that’s where we thought we could leverage the use of digital currency” posabit is in use by  different dispensaries across washington state one of posabit’s customers trove cannabis recorded  million in marijuana sales last year all done in cash that averages to about  individual transactions weekly trove cannabis was on a waitlist to use posabit for six months in february posabit services were made available and since then percent of the business’ customers have chosen to use bitcoin when customers make a purchase they’re asked if they’d like to pay with cash or digital currency if digital currency is preferred the customer is referred to the posabit kiosk which charges a  transaction fee to purchase bitcoin to complete their purchase once transactions are completed posabit sends the funds in us currency to the dispensary’s bank account to maintain compliance posabit follows these guidelines limit of  of bitcoin purchased per transaction point fraud detection program bank account is required for the business neil demers a marijuana business owner in denver said “i’m sure education could enlighten me and a lot of this industry on bitcoin being a feasible payment option but we just don’t see it” some industry experts like jeffrey zucker of green lion partners believe that traditional banking options should be available before bitcoin really gets its footing in the industry zucker said “the banking issues are going to be solved in such time that the people in this industry are going to gravitate toward traditional banking” greg lambrecht of singlepoint said “it’s not foreign to them now like some sort of weird scam that they don’t know about more and more establishments are accepting it but it’s kind of like the wild wild west”    share facebook twitter google  linkedin pinterest previous new cannabinoid testing  desert valley testing next  off
