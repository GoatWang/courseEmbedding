regionca countryusa posted  march    pm hi everyone  i am looking to buy my first truck camper and am looking at either the lance  or wolf creek  models  both are similar in size but im not sure which one is the best quality camper  it will go on a  dodge ram  short bed diesel pickup   looking at the spec sheets the main difference i can see is the wolf creek can accomodate two batteries whereas the lance can only accept one  otherwise the differences arent too drastic that i can tell   i have looked at the lance camper in person and liked what i saw  i have not seen the wolf creek in person just online  but the wolf creek has similar features and is several thousand less  wolf creek is made by northwood  what is your opinion on the two manufacturers  i cant seem to find much info online regarding the wolf creek  it seems the lance has an edge based on the longevity of making campers but what is your experience with either brand   any advice  help you can provide will be greatly appreciated  although the campers are near the lower end of the price scale they are still an expensive toy that i want to purchase right the first time   if you need any other info from me let me knowim not used to asking questions in an online forum so im not sure what info would be pertinent   thanks back to top  offline   farmer farmer past president natcoa members  posts local time  pm

impressed by the build quality of eagle cap i also like ss but you have to go to their factory to get one you always get what you pay for better materials and products used in construction add up look at several tcs of similar size to what you want go look at a few and give them a good going through open and close the doors feel how they work put some torque on them and see how solid they feel against force pump your weight up and down on the floor and see how solid it feels grab the dinette table and give it a good pull and shove lean on it and feel how solid it is feel the bath door the tc entry door and make sure they have a quality feel to them and the lock hardware look at the cabinetry and decide if the model is providing enough storage area some manufacturers are better than others at creating cabinet storage space has it got decent water and waste water sizing propane  tanks is good battery  group  will keep you happy test sit in the john and decide if you can live with the all to often limited room i dont want to bad mouth any builders product because they all fit a place in the market and give some folks what they need be it high quality or the biggest for the buck

shadow   welcome to the forum   you have come the the right place for advice  from those who own truck campers not those who sell truck campers  im new to truck camping myself so i dont have years of expericence in knowing first hand who has a tc that lasts and lasts from what i have read on those that have posted before me they all have great advice  go and kick the tires ive heard alot camper jeff  kelli layed it out in detial best i think go and spend some time sit on the throne lay on the bed sit at the table open the doors cupboads tv swing arm open the windows the roof vent  youll soon know which seems better built  and they might both be better built  ive heard nothing but good things from the two companies you have mentioned i live in iowa and northstar campers are manufatured here so i went and checked them out  kicked the tires all around and i could see it was built well  i got a tour of the factory and got to see them from skeleton all the way down the assembly line and could tell they were built well  so even if you have to drive a day or two to kick the tires on a tc the money you spend doing that will give you peace of mind in the long run that you did the right thing in checking it out and like you said you dont want to make the mistake and pay for it later on   have fun hunting for that perfect tc  the hunt is part of the fun  youll know when the perfect one for you is in your crossheirs later doug check out events with the midwest truck campers  frineds at wwwmidwesttruckcamperswordpresscomclick link httpwwwmidwesttrswordpresscomwagon master  for mwtcs back to top  offline   shadow shadow tenderfoot members  posts local time  am stateprovince or regionca countryusa posted  march    pm thanks for the great advice  i have sat in a lance and liked it but the closest dealer that has a wolf creek  in stock is about  hours away  i live in nor cal so the trip to oregon where the camper is would be a good investment as there is no sales tax in oregonso im not against the drive but am leery if its worth it   i have looked at some other campers including a hard sided northstar laredo  i thought the table leg on that camper was wobbly and not very sturdy  compare that to the lance i sat in which had a sturdy table  i do like the wolf creek  because it has the option for two batteries whereas the lance can only accept one unless i engineer something after purchase  neither model wc  or lance  offers two lp tanks   i have somewhat settled on the smaller campers because i like to boondock new term since i started looking at campers but it describes me and eventually take a long trip to alaska  ive been told my  dodge ram  pickup could handle a larger camper such as a lance  but am worried about the extra suspension work i might have to do to make it ride nice  is that a legitimate concern  the other disadvantage is the larger camper is taller and wider which would cause a reduction in mpg  if you had to buy a camper again would you go bigger than you thought or stay small   the advantage to going up one step would be two lp tanks and two batteries  are these items worth the extra few thousand dollars less mpg and additional suspension mods   thanks   mike back to top  offline   bedlam bedlam grand potentate natcoa members  posts local time  am stateprovince or regionwa countryusa gendermale locationeverett wa

compare lance and wolf creek the materials and processes used building them are entirely different lance uses the most modern methods of design and manufacture they also use many new materials that may prove to be superior but only time will tell if they are superior or if they have unique problems of their own the northwood products arctic fox and wolf creek employ more conventional and time proven methods that is not to say they havent evolved they just havent havent found another way that is better for them i have owned an older lance and i now own an artic fox and while both are good campers i like the af better arctic fox or wolf creek northwood builds a quality product that they stand behind i and others have found northwoods customer service to be second to none that means a lot to me   i have never taken a good look at a wolf creek i have seen only one but i was purchasing an af and didnt have the time or inclination to crawl all over the wolf creek  but i am very bias toward northwood products it may be worth a drive to investigate blast up on a saturday and lookt it over then take a senic drive home with and overnight stop  make it a mini vacation   russ back to

to tcen as well  your doing a fine job of finding out all of the problems to avoid down the road     another thing to think about is a good rv dealer if you buying from a dealer  if your buying from the manufacture then thats different   i have personaly read posts on here of how well northwoods manufacturing has treated it customers that own a northwoods product  i read a post on here of someone who bought a used artic fox   i believe it was an older one  he took it to the manufacture to get some problems worked on and they went over and beyond fixing the main problem and fixed a couple of other little things to for the guy free of charge  wow that floored me  they might not do that for everyone but word gets around and people tend to buy from places like that  a manufacture that stands behind their product  im sure that guy will buy another arctic fox someday  good sales point for northwoods too check out events with the midwest truck campers  frineds

most tcs over other brands i would expect the most feedback about lance for that reason more people respond to negatives about a product than positives since the happy people are camping instead of posting so i also expect a disproportionate number of unsatisfied responses than positive on the other hand i looked at the quality of build on the lance adventurer northern lite and arctic fox  the lance was at the bottom of that list and northern lite was on top i didnt have any experience with any these manufactures but northwood mfg who makes arctic fox always had high praise from its owners
