spritzer cfa value special situations debtgeorge spritzer on linkedinsummarysteven n harris has submitted a shareholder proposal to have the fund selftender for all outstanding sharessaba capital has also accumulated shares of the fund and has had recent success with clough capital closedend fundsthe usa discount is  which has narrowed recently but the discount can easily go to single digits if the activists are successful the liberty allstar equity fund usa has received a shareholder proposal from steven n harris who is an activist investor mr harris is requesting the board of usa to authorize a selftender offer for all outstanding shares of the fund at or close to net asset value if more than  of the fund’s outstanding common shares are submitted for tender the board is requested to cancel the tender offer and take steps to cause the fund to be liquidated or converted into an exchange traded fund etf or an openend mutual fund the shareholder proposal is nonbinding but if a large number of shareholders vote in favor of the proposal it puts a lot of pressure on the board to authorize some form of tender offer or to take other steps to try to narrow the discount of the fund the fund originally tried to omit this shareholder proposal from the proxy materials but the sec ruled that the proposal must be included here is a link to the letter sent by the sec to the fund in the most recent sec filing only one shareholder owns over  of the outstanding shares it is first trust portfolios which owns  of the shares outstanding these shares are spread over a large number of unit trusts and it is not clear whether first trust would vote these shares for or against the shareholder proposal but there are many other wellknown closedend fund activists with smaller holdings in usa as of march   which will most likely support the shareholder proposal on nasdaqcom the usa institutional ownership is about  of the shares outstanding including the following investors that own more than one million shares and often vote in favor of activist shareholder proposals investor number of shares of usa as of march   karpus management  rivernorth capital  lazard asset management   capital partners  saba capital management  relative value partners  bulldog investors deschutes portfolio strat thomas j herzfeld adv    saba capital management has recently become much more active in closedend fund activism they recently started a closedend fund etf cefs which seeks to outperform indexbased closedend fund products by actively trading the portfolio to capture the widening and narrowing of discounts to net asset value i checked the latest portfolio of the saba etf and found that usa was one of the larger holdings at nearly  of the portfolio currently the saba etf is still quite small with only  million in net assets but it can give us an idea which closedend funds are being targeted by activist investors liberty allstar equity fund is an unleveraged equity closedend fund with about  billion in assets under management the primary objective of the fund is to seek total investment return by investing at least  of the portfolio in equity securities data below is sourced from the fund sponsor website wwwallstarfundscom unless otherwise stated usa is a multimanaged fund that allocates its portfolio assets among several independent investment management organizations that have different investment styles the fund combines three valuestyle managers and two growthstyle managers alp advisors inc is the funds investment advisor and periodically shuffles the underlying management firms based on performance alp advisors has currently allocated the funds assets to the following five investment firms investment firm style managers aristotle capital management llc value howard gleicher cfa macquarie investment management value d tysen nutt jr pzena investment management value richard s pzena john j flynn  benjamin s silver cfa sustainable growth advisers lp growth george fraise robert rohn  gordon marchand cfa tcw investment management company growth craig c blum cfa one disadvantage of this arrangement is that you have to pay two levels of management fees  part of the fee goes to alp advisors which administers the fund and manages the underlying managers and then each underlying manager gets a fee but the total expense ratio for usa of  is not unreasonable and is in line with many other equity closedend funds this is mainly because the underlying managers get pretty small fees alp advisors splits the investment management fee with the underlying asset managers because the total asset size is over  billion all four rows in the table are currently used to compute the fee here is the investment fee structure average net daily assets fee to alpine fee to underlying manager first  million   next  million   next  million   over  billion   it is unclear whether the manager of manager approach actually adds value in the long run i know that vanguard investments has used this approach with some of their mutual funds but they have had mixed results and is moving more toward using less managers per fund alp advisors must feel the need to justify its fee so they have an incentive to change the underlying manager roster every few years here is an investment style spectrum that lays out how the portfolio assets were distributed among the five underlying managers as of the last yearend note how the pe ratio and pricebook value ratio for the total fund lines up pretty closely with the sp  index the portfolio is largely domestic with some global exposure here is the sector breakdown and top  portfolio holdings as of may   information technology  financials  health care  consumer discretionary  consumer staples  energy  industrials  materials  real estate  utilities  telecommunications  managed distribution policy the current policy of usa is to pay about  of its net asset value per year payable in four quarterly installments these distributions are unrelated to the funds net investment income or net realized capital gains or losses if the total distributions for a given year exceed the funds investment income and net realized capital gains the excess will generally be treated as nontaxable return of capital alpha is generated by high discount  distributions the distribution rate of  along with the  discount allows investors to capture alpha by recovering a portion of the discount whenever a distribution is paid out whenever you recover nav from a fund selling at a  discount the percentage return is   or about  so the discount recapture alpha generated from the  distribution is computed as  or about  a year in discount recapture this is more than the  annualized baseline expense ratio so you essentially get the fund management for free with an effective expense ratio of  note that this alpha capture occurs even if the discount remains as long as the fund keeps paying out at the same managed distribution rate and because of the activist involvement you may also be able to capture more from the discount if the fund is ever converted into an etf or an openend mutual fund market performance the longterm total return nav performance record for usa has been below the average of its large growth peers since the funds managers are changed periodically it is quite possible that future market performance may improve but overall the main attraction of usa now are its discount and high managed distribution policy along with the activist involvement because of this i would treat usa as more of a swing trade instead of a longerterm buy and hold usa nav performance large growth nav performance sp  ytd     year     year     year     year     year    source
