recent    pools although marginally lower new vehicles total  and the pool is geographically concentrated in the southeast consistent with historical world omni originations high percentage of extendedterm loans loans with original terms greater than  months total  in b extendedterm loans have historically produced higher loss rates mitigating this somewhat is that the borrowers within this longer term range have strong obligor fico scores fitch accounted for this risk in its determination of the loss proxy adequate credit enhancement structure credit enhancement ce in b is consistent with prior transactions the structure is able to support multiples of fitchs base case loss proxy of  that are commensurate with the expected ratings evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle

result in fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to world omni auto receivables trust b to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses the sensitivity analysis shows a potential downgrade of one category for
