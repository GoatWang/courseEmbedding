foreign currency that currency has a price and that price fluctuates in order to reduce the risk of currency price swings or for other purposes the portfolio may buy forward foreign exchange contracts on foreign currencies these contracts lock in a price for the currency at a certain future date the asia technology portfolio may also use put and call options on foreign currencies o options and warrants an option is a contract giving the owner the right to buy call option or sell put option a security at a designated price strike price on a certain date a warrant is the equivalent of a call option written by the issuer of the underlying security o futures contracts futures contracts obligate one party to deliver and the other party to purchase a specific quantity of a commodity or a financial instrument at a designated future date time and place stock index futures contracts call for a cash payment based on the increase or decrease in the value of an index the asia technology portfolio may enter into foreign currency forward contracts repurchase agreements arins and certain other types of futures options and derivatives with banks brokerage firms and other investors in overthecounter markets not through any exchange temporary investments to respond to adverse market economic political or other conditions the asia technology portfolio may invest up to  of its assets in high quality debt and money market instruments issued or guaranteed by us or asian issuers or governments their agencies or instrumentalities the asia technology portfolio may invest up to  of its assets in these securities to maintain liquidity to the extent that the asia technology portfolio engages in this temporary defensive strategy the asia technology portfolio may not achieve its investment objective principal risks of investment investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose money the principal risks of investing in the asia technology portfolio are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value total return and value of the asia technology portfolio and your investment o stock market risks stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks and significant fluctuations in value if the stock market declines in value the asia technology portfolio is likely to decline in value and you could lose money on your investment o stock selection risksthe stocks selected by the subadviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to meet the asia technology portfolios investment objective o liquidity risks the subadviser may not be able to sell investment securities at an optimal time or price o industry risks mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a risk that a group of industryrelated stocks will decline in price due to industryspecific development companies in the same or similar industries may share common characteristics and are more likely to react to industryspecific market or economic developments o technology industry specific risks companies that conduct business in the technology industries are subject to government regulation and the rate of change in technology and scientific innovation as well as competition which is generally higher than that of other industries o small and mediumsized company risks the asia technology portfolio may invest in the stocks of small medium and largesized companies small and mediumsized companies often have narrower markets and more limited managerial and financial resources than do larger more established companies as a result their performance can be more volatile and they face a greater risk of business failure which could increase the volatility of the asia technology portfolios assets o political risks the asia technology portfolio invests in securities of foreign countries that have experienced historical periods of political instability these securities carry higher returns but involve more risks than those associated with us investments o foreign securities risks the asia technology portfolio invests in foreign securities which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than those associated with us investments additional risks include currency fluctuations political and economic instability differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets o emerging markets risks the asia technology portfolio invests in emerging as well as developed markets in asia countries in emerging markets can have relatively unstable government economies based on only a few industries and securities markets that trade a small number of issues o nondiversification risks as a nondiversified investment company more of the asia technology portfolios assets may be concentrated in the common stock of any single issuer which may make the value of the asia technology portfolios shares more susceptible to certain risks than are shares of a more diversified mutual fund o derivatives risks the asia technology portfolio may utilize derivatives for hedging purposes andor direct investment derivatives contain certain special risks including the imperfect correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the value of the underlying asset investment objective strategies and risks of the government money market portfolio investment objective the investment objective of the government money market portfolio is to provide current income consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity investment strategies the government money market portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing all of its investable assets in high quality us dollardenominated shortterm obligations that have been determined by the investment adviser subject to the approval of the government money market portfolios board of trustees to present minimal credit risk the government money market portfolio invests exclusively in obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by such obligations us government securities us government securities include direct obligations of the us treasury such as treasury bills treasury notes and treasury bonds the government money market portfolio seeks to maintain a constant  net asset value per share us government securities are high quality instruments guaranteed as to principal and interest and issued by the us treasury or by an agency or instrumentality of the us government not all us government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states however some are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury others are backed by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase the agencies obligations while others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality in the case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states the government money market portfolio must look principally to the agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment yields on short intermediate and longterm us government securities are dependent on a variety of factors including the general conditions of the money and bond markets the size of a particular offering and the maturity of the obligation debt securities with longer maturities tend to produce higher capital appreciation and depreciation than do obligations with shorter maturities and lower yields the market value of us government securities generally varies inversely with changes in interest rates an increase in interest rates therefore generally would reduce the market value of the government money market portfolios investments in us government securities while a decline in interest rates generally would increase the market value of the government money market portfolios investments in these securities under a repurchase agreement the government money market portfolio purchases a us government security and simultaneously agrees to sell the security back to the seller at a mutually agreedupon future price and date normally one day or a few days later the resale price is greater than the purchase price reflecting an agreedupon market interest rate premium during the government money market portfolios holding period while the maturities of the underlying securities in repurchase agreement transactions may be more than one year the term of each repurchase agreement will always be less than one year the government money market portfolio may enter into repurchase agreements with banks that are members of federal reserve system or securities dealers who are members of a national securities exchange or are primary dealers in us government securities the investment adviser monitors the creditworthiness of each firm that is a party to a repurchase agreement with the government money market portfolio principal risks of investment the principal risks of investing in the government money market portfolio are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value total return and value of the government money market portfolio and your investment o interest rate risks the rate of income will vary from day to day depending on shortterm interest rates it is possible that a major change in interest rates could cause the value of your investment to decline the values of the obligations held by the portfolio can be expected to vary inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates although the investment policies of the fund and portfolio are designed to minimize these changes and to maintain a net asset value of  per share there is no assurance that these policies will be successful o credit risks changes in the credit quality rating or changes in an issuers financial condition can also affect the portfolio a default on a security held or a repurchase agreement entered into by the portfolio could cause the value of your investment in the fund to decline o repurchase agreement risks one of the risks of investing in repurchase agreements is that the seller may not repurchase the securities from the portfolio which may result in the portfolio selling the security for less than the price agreed upon with the seller another risk of repurchase agreements is that the seller may default or file for bankruptcy under which circumstances the portfolio might have to wait through lengthy court actions before selling the securities in the event of a default or bankruptcy by the seller the portfolio will liquidate those securities held under the repurchase agreement which securities constitute collateral for the sellers obligation to repurchase the securities main risks of the portfolios the principal risks of investing in each portfolio are described previously in this prospectus the following list provides more detail about some of those risks along with information on additional types of risks which may apply to the portfolios investing in mutual fundsall portfolios all mutual funds carry risks that may cause you to lose money on your investment in one or more of the portfolios the following describes the primary risks to each portfolio based on each portfolios specific investment objective and strategies as all investment securities are subject to inherent market risks and fluctuations in value due to earnings economic and political conditions and other factors the portfolios can give no assurance that its investment objective will be achieved market riskall portfolios other than the government money market portfolio the net asset value of each portfolio will fluctuate based on changes in the value of its underlying portfolio the stock market is generally susceptible to volatile fluctuations in market price market prices of securities in which each portfolio invests may be adversely affected by an issuers having experienced losses or by the lack of earnings or by the issuers failure to meet the markets expectations with respect to new products or services or even by factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of the issuer the value of the securities held by the portfolios is also subject to the risk that a specific segment of the stock market does not perform as well as the overall market under any of these circumstances the value of each portfolios shares and total return will fluctuate and your investment in the corresponding portfolio may be worth more or less than your original cost when you redeem your shares internet industry specific risksthe internet portfolio the infrastructure portfolio the emerging growth portfolio the global growth portfolio and the new paradigm portfolio the value of each portfolios shares will be susceptible to factors affecting the internet such as heightened regulatory scrutiny and impending changes in government policies which may have a material effect on the products and services of this industry furthermore securities of companies in this industry tend to be more volatile than securities of companies in other industries competitive pressures and changing demand may have a significant effect on the financial condition of internet companies these companies spend heavily on research and development and are especially sensitive to the risk of product obsolescence the occurrence of any of these factors individually or collectively may adversely affect the value of a portfolios shares and your investment in the corresponding fund medical research industryspecific risksthe medical portfolio medical and pharmaceuticalrelated companies in general are subject to the rate of change in technology which is generally higher than that of other industries similarly cancer researchrelated industries use many products and services of companies engaged in medical and pharmaceuticalrelated activities and are also subject to relatively high risks of rapid obsolescence caused by progressive scientific and technological advances medical research and development is also subject to strict regulatory scrutiny and ongoing legislative action energy industryspecific risksthe energy portfolio the value of the energy portfolios shares will be susceptible to factors affecting the energy industry such as volatile market supply and demand conditions and changes in domestic government policies which may have a material effect on the products and services of this industry furthermore securities of companies in this industry tend to be more volatile than securities of companies in other industries competitive pressures and changing demand may have a significant effect on the financial condition of energyrelated companies alternative energyrelated companies spend heavily on research and development and are especially sensitive to the risk of product obsolescence the occurrence of any of these factors individually or collectively may adversely affect the value of the energy portfolios shares and your investment in the portfolio other securities a portfolio might purchaseall portfolios other than the government money market portfolio under normal market conditions each portfolio invests at least  of its total assets in equity securities consisting of common stocks convertible securities warrants and securities having the characteristics of common stocks if the investment adviser believes that market conditions warrant a temporary defensive posture a portfolio may invest without limitation in high quality shortterm debt securities and money market instruments these shortterm debt securities and money market instruments include commercial paper certificates of deposit bankers acceptances and us government securities and repurchase agreements for the asia technology portfolio shortterm debt securities and money market instruments may be issued by asian governments their agencies or instrumentalities securities lendingall portfolios other than the government money market portfolio each portfolio may lend its portfolio securities to brokerdealers by entering directly into lending arrangements with such brokerdealers or indirectly through repurchase agreements amounting to no more than   of its assets repurchase transactions will be fully collateralized at all times with cash andor shortterm debt obligations these transactions involve some risk to a portfolio if the other party should default on its obligation and the portfolio is delayed or prevented from recovering the collateral in the event that the original seller defaults on its obligation to repurchase a portfolio will seek to sell the collateral which could involve costs or delays to the extent proceeds from the sale of collateral are less than the repurchase price each portfolio forced to sell such collateral in this manner would suffer a loss nondiversificationall portfolios other than the government money market portfolio each portfolio is classified as nondiversified under federal securities laws which means that onehalf of each portfolios assets may be invested in two or more stocks while the other half is spread out among various investments not exceeding  of a portfolios total assets as a result of their nondiversified status a portfolios shares may be more susceptible to adverse changes in the value of the securities of a particular company than would be the shares of a diversified investment company investment in small and mediumsize companiesall portfolios other than the government money market portfolio each portfolio may invest in small or mediumsize companies accordingly a portfolio may be subject to the additional risks associated with investment in companies with small or mediumsize capital structures generally a market capitalization of  billion or less the market prices of the securities of such companies tend to be more volatile than those of larger companies further these securities tend to trade at a lower volume than those of larger more established companies if a portfolio is heavily invested in these securities and the value of these securities suddenly decline the net asset value of that portfolio and your investment in the corresponding fund will be more susceptible to significant losses foreign securitiesall portfolios other than the government money market portfolio investing in foreign securities can carry higher returns than those generally associated with us investments however foreign securities may be substantially riskier than us investments the economies of foreign countries may differ from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product rate of inflation currency depreciation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position furthermore the economies of developing countries generally are heavily dependent on international trade and accordingly have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers exchange controls managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protective measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade these economies also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade a portfolio may be required to obtain prior governmental approval for foreign investments in some countries under certain circumstances governments may require approval to invest in certain issuers or industries deemed sensitive to national interests and the extent of foreign investment in certain debt securities and us companies may be subject to limitation individual companies may also limit foreign ownership to prevent among other things violation of foreign investment limitations some foreign investments may risk being subject to repatriation controls that could render such securities illiquid other countries might undergo nationalization expropriation political changes governmental regulation social instability or diplomatic developments including war that could adversely affect the economies of such countries or the value of the investments in those countries for this reason portfolios that invest primarily in the securities of a single country will be greatly impacted by any political economic or regulatory developments affecting the value of the securities additional risks include currency fluctuations political and economic instability differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets emerging market risksthe middle east portfolio and the asia technology portfolio securities issued or traded in emerging markets generally entail greater risks than securities issued or traded in developed markets for example their prices can be significantly more volatile than prices in developed countries emerging market economies may also experience more severe downturns with corresponding currency devaluations than developed economies emerging market countries may have relatively unstable governments and may present the risk of nationalization of businesses expropriation confiscatory taxation or in certain instances reversion to closed market centrally planned economies because the middle east portfolio and the asia technology portfolio invest in emerging markets regions these portfolio returns will be significantly more volatile and may differ substantially from the overall us market generally your investment in either of these portfolios has the risk that market changes or other factors affecting asian andor middle eastern region countries including political instability and unpredictable economic conditions may have a more significant effect on these portfolios net asset values than would be the case for a mutual fund invested in us securities regional risksthe middle east and the asia technology portfolio certain risks associated with international investments and investing in smaller developing capital markets are heightened for investments in asian andor middle eastern region countries for example some of the currencies of asian countries have experienced steady devaluations relative to the us dollar and major adjustments have been made in certain of these currencies periodically although there is a trend toward less government involvement in commerce governments of many asian countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in certain cases the government still owns or controls many companies including some of the largest in the country the same may be true of middle eastern region countries accordingly government actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in asian and middle eastern region countries which could affect private sector companies and the portfolios as well as the value of the portfolios investment securities portfolio borrowingall portfolios each portfolio may leverage up to  of its assets to portfolio investment activities or to achieve higher returns each portfolio may borrow money from banks for temporary or emergency purposes in order to meet redemption requests to reduce its indebtedness a portfolio may have to sell a portion of its investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so in addition interest paid by a portfolio on borrowed funds would decrease the net earnings of both that portfolio and your investment in the portfolio derivatives riskall portfolios other than the government money market portfolio each portfolio may invest in derivatives such as options and futures the successful use of the investment practices described above depends on the portfolio managers ability to forecast stock price movements andor currency exchange rate movements correctly should stock prices or exchange rates move unexpectedly a portfolio may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions or may realize losses and thus be in a worse position than if such strategies had not been used unlike many exchangetraded futures contracts and options on futures contracts there are no daily price fluctuation limits for certain options and forward contracts and adverse market movements could therefore continue to an unlimited extent over a period of time in addition the correlation between movements in the prices of futures contracts options and forward contracts and movements in the prices of the securities and currencies hedged or used for cover will not be perfect and could produce unanticipated losses a portfolios ability to dispose of its positions in futures contracts options and forward contracts depends on the availability of liquid markets in such instruments markets in options and futures with respect to a number of types of securities and currencies are relatively new and still developing and there is no public market for forward contracts it is impossible to predict the amount of trading interest that may exist in various types of futures contracts options and forward contracts if a secondary market does not exist for an option purchased or written by a portfolio it might not be possible to effect a closing transaction in the option ie dispose of the option with the result that  an option purchased by a portfolio would have to be exercised in order for the portfolio to realize any profit and  a portfolio may not be able to sell currencies or portfolio securities covering an option written by the portfolio until the option expires or it delivers the underlying security futures contract or currency upon exercise therefore no assurance can be given that the portfolios will be able to utilize these instruments effectively in addition a portfolios ability to engage in options and futures transactions may be limited by tax considerations and the use of certain hedging techniques may adversely impact the characterization of income to the portfolio for us federal income tax purposes management of the

sai are not fundamental and may be changed by the board of trustees of the trust without shareholder approval common and preferred stock common stocks are units of ownership of a corporation preferred stocks are stocks that often pay dividends at a specific rate and have a preference over common stocks in dividend payments and liquidation of assets some preferred stocks may be convertible into common stock convertible securities are securities that may be converted into or exchanged for a specified amount of common stock of the same or different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula convertible debt securities the portfolios may invest in debt securities convertible into common stocks debt purchased by the portfolios will consist of obligations of mediumgrade or higher having at least adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal nonconvertible debt obligations will be rated bbb or higher by sp or baa or higher by moodys convertible debt obligations will be rated b or higher by sp or b or higher by moodys securities rated baa by moodys are considered by moodys to be mediumgrade securities and have adequate capacity to pay principal and interest bonds in the lowest investment grade category bbb have speculative characteristics with changes in the economy or other circumstances more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the bonds to make principal and interest payments than would occur with bonds rated in higher categories securities rated b are referred to as highrisk securities generally lack characteristics of a desirable investment and are deemed speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal over a long period of time see appendix to this statement of additional information for a description of debt security ratings whenissued and delayed delivery transactions the portfolios may purchase securities on a whenissued delayeddelivery or forward commitment basis these transactions generally involve the purchase of a security with payment and delivery due at some time in the future a portfolio does not earn interest on such securities until settlement and bears the risk of market value fluctuations in between the purchase and settlement dates if the seller fails to complete the sale a portfolio may lose the opportunity to obtain a favorable price and yield while the portfolios will generally engage in such whenissued delayeddelivery and forward commitment transactions with the intent of actually acquiring the securities a portfolio may sometimes sell such a security prior to the settlement date the portfolios may also sell securities on a delayeddelivery or forward commitment basis if portfolios do so they will not participate in future gains or losses on the security if the other party to such a transaction fails to pay for the securities the portfolio could suffer a loss restricted and illiquid securities each portfolio may invest in a limited amount of restricted securities restricted securities are securities that are thinly traded or whose resale is restricted by federal securities laws restricted securities are any securities in which the portfolios may invest pursuant to their investment objective and policies but which are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities laws fixedincome securities the fixedincome securities in which the portfolios may invest are generally subject to two kinds of risk credit risk and market risk credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer to meet interest and principal payments as they come due the ratings given a security by moodys and sp provide a generally useful guide as to such credit risk the lower the rating given a security by such rating service the greater the credit risk such rating service perceives to exist with respect to such security increasing the amount of portfolio assets invested in unrated or lowergrade securities while intended to increase the yield produced by those assets will also increase the credit risk to which those assets are subject market risk relates to the fact that the market values of securities in which the portfolios may invest generally will be affected by changes in the level of interest rates an increase in interest rates will tend to reduce the market values of such securities whereas a decline in interest rates will tend to increase their values medium and lowerrated securities baa or bbb and lower and nonrated securities of comparable quality tend to be subject to wilder fluctuations in yields and market values than higherrated securities mediumrated securities those rated baa or bbb have speculative characteristics while lowerrated securities are predominantly speculative the portfolios are not required to dispose of debt securities whose ratings are downgraded below these ratings subsequent to the portfolios purchase of the securities relying in part on ratings assigned by credit agencies in making investments will not protect the portfolios from the risk that the fixedincome securities in which the portfolios invest will decline in value credit ratings represent evaluations of the safety of principal dividend and interest payments on preferred stocks and debt securities not the market values of such securities and such ratings may not be changed on a timely basis to reflect subsequent events at no time will the portfolios have more than  of their respective total assets invested in any fixedincome securities that are unrated or rated below investment grade either at the time of purchase or as a result of a reduction in rating after purchase depositary receipts the portfolios may invest in american depositary receipts adrs or other forms of depositary receipts such as international depositary receipts idrs depositary receipts are typically issued in connection with a us or foreign bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation investments in these types of securities involve certain inherent risks generally associated with investments in foreign securities including the following political and economic factors individual foreign economies of certain countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from the united states economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency diversification and balance of payments position the internal politics of certain foreign countries may not be as stable as those of the united states governments in certain foreign countries also continue to participate to a significant degree through ownership interest or regulation in their respective economies action by these governments could include restrictions on foreign investment nationalization expropriation of goods or imposition of taxes and could have a significant effect on market prices of securities and payment of interest the economies of many foreign countries are heavily dependent upon international trade and are accordingly affected by the trade policies and economic conditions of their trading partners enactment by these trading partners of protectionist trade legislation could have a significant adverse effect upon the securities markets of such countries currency fluctuations a change in the value of any foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a corresponding change in the us dollar value of an adrs underlying portfolio securities denominated in that currency such changes will affect the portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is invested in adrs comprised of foreign securities taxes the interest and dividends payable on certain foreign securities comprising an adr may be subject to foreign withholding taxes thus reducing the net amount of income to be paid to the portfolios and that may ultimately be available for distribution to the portfolios shareholders derivatives buying call and put options the portfolios may purchase call options such transaction may be entered into in order to limit the risk of a substantial increase in the market price of the security that each portfolio intends to purchase prior to its expiration a call option may be sold in a closing sale transaction any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the call option plus the related transaction cost the portfolios may purchase put options by buying a put each portfolio has the right to sell the security at the exercise price thus limiting its risk of risk of loss through a decline in the market value of the security until the put expires the amount of any appreciation in the value of the underlying security will be partially offset by the amount of the premium paid for the put option and any related transaction cost prior to its expiration a put option may be sold in a closing sale transaction and any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the put option plus the related transaction costs writing selling call and put options the portfolios may write covered options on equity and debt securities and indices this means that in the case of call options so long as each portfolio is obligated as the writer of a call option it will own the underlying security subject to the option and in the case of put options it will through its custodian deposit and maintain either cash or securities with a market value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the option covered call options written by the portfolios give the holder the right to buy the underlying securities from the portfolios as a stated exercise price a call option written by the portfolios is covered if the portfolios own the underlying security that is subject to the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration or for additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its custodian bank upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio a call option is also covered if the portfolios hold a call on the same security and in the same principal amount as the call written where the exercise price of the call held a is equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or b is greater than the exercise price of the call written if the difference is maintained by the portfolios in cash and high grade debt securities in a segregated account with its custodian bank the portfolios may purchase securities which may be covered with call options solely on the basis of considerations consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the portfolios the portfolios turnover may increase through the exercise of a call option this will generally occur if the market value of a covered security increases and the fund has not entered in to a closing purchase transaction as a writer of an option each portfolio receives a premium less a commission and in exchange foregoes the opportunity to profit from any increase in the market value of the security exceeding the call option price the premium serves to mitigate the effect of any depreciation in the market value of the security the premium paid by the buyer of an option will reflect among other things the relationship of the exercise price to the market price the volatility of the underlying security the remaining term of the option the existing supply and demand and the interest rates the writer of a call option may have no control over when the underlying securities must be sold because the writer may be assigned an exercise notice at any time prior to the termination of the obligation exercise of a call option by the purchaser will cause each portfolio to forego future appreciation of the securities covered by the option whether or not an option expires unexercised the writer retains the amount of the premium this amount may in the case of a covered call option be offset by a decline in the market value of the underlying security during the option period if a call option is exercised the writer experiences a profit or loss from the sale of the underlying security thus during the option period the writer of a call option gives up the opportunity for appreciation in the market value of the underlying security or currency above the exercise price it retains the risk of the loss should the price of the underlying security or foreign currency decline writing call options also involves risks relating to each portfolios ability to close out the option it has written each portfolio may write exchangetraded call options on its securities call options may be written on portfolio securities indices or foreign currencies with respect to securities and foreign currencies the portfolio may write call and put options on an exchange or overthecounter call options on portfolio securities will be covered since the portfolio will own the underlying securities call option on securities indices will be written only to hedge in an economically appropriate way portfolio securities that are not otherwise hedged with options or financial futures contracts and will be covered by identifying the specific portfolio securities being hedged options on foreign currencies will be covered by securities denominated in that currency options on securities indices will be covered by securities that substantially replicated the movement of the index a put option on a security security index or foreign currency gives the purchaser of the option in return for the premium paid to the writer seller the right to sell the underlying security index or foreign currency at the exercise price at any time during the option period when each portfolio writes a secured put option in will gain a profit in the amount of the premium less a commission so long as the price of the underlying security remains above the exercise price however each portfolio remains obligated to purchase the underlying security from the buyer of the put option usually in the event the price of the security falls bellows the exercise price at any time during the option period if the price of the underlying security falls below the exercise price the portfolios may realize a loss in the amount of the difference between the exercise price and the sale price of the security less the premium received upon exercise by the purchaser the writer of a put option has the obligation to purchase the underlying security or foreign currency at the exercise price a put option on a securities index is similar to a put option on an individual security except that the value of the option depends on the weighted value of the group of securities comprising the index and all settlements are made in cash during the option period the writer of a put option has assumed the risk that the price of the underlying security or foreign currency will decline below the exercise price however the writer of the put option has retained the opportunity for an appreciated above the exercise price should the market price of the underlying security or foreign currency increase writing put options also involves risks relating to the portfolios ability to close out the option that it has written the writer of an option who wishes to terminate his or her obligation may effect a closing purchase transaction by buying an option of the same series as the option previously written the effect of the purchase is that the clearing corporation will cancel the writers position however a writer may not effect a closing purchase transaction after being notified of the exercise of an option there is also no guarantee that the portfolios will be able to effect a closing purchase transaction for the options it has written effecting a closing purchase transaction in the case of a written call option will permit the portfolios to write another call option on the underlying security with a different exercise price expiration date or both effecting a closing purchase transaction will also permit the portfolios to use cash or proceeds from the investments if a portfolio desires to sell a particular security from its portfolio on which it has written a call option it will effect a closing purchase transaction before or at the same time as the sale of the security the portfolios will realize a profit from a closing purchase transaction if the price of the transaction is less than the premium received from writing the option likewise the portfolios will realize a loss from a closing purchase transaction if the price of the transaction is more than the premium received from writing the option because increases in the market price of a call option will generally reflect increases in the market price of the underlying security any loss resulting from the repurchase of a call option is likely to be offset in whole or in part by appreciation of the underlying security owned by a portfolio writing overthecounter otc options the portfolios may engage in options transactions that trade on the otc market to the same extent that it intends to engage in exchange traded options just as with exchange traded options otc options give the holder the right to buy an underlying security from or sell an underlying security to an option writer at a stated exercise price however otc options differ from exchange traded options in certain material respects otc options are arranged directly with dealers and not as is the case with exchange traded options through a clearing corporation thus there is a risk of nonperformance by the dealer because there is no exchange pricing is typically done by reference to information obtained from market makers since otc options are available for a greater variety of securities and in a wider range of expiration dates and exercise prices the writer of an otc option is paid the premium in advance by the dealer a writer or purchaser of a put or call option can terminate it voluntarily only by entering into a closing transaction there can be no assurance that a continuously liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option at any specific time consequently the portfolios may be able to realize the value of an otc option it has purchased only by exercising it or entering into a closing sale transaction with the dealer that issued it similarly when a portfolio writes an otc option it generally can close out that option prior to its expiration only by entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer to which it originally wrote to option if a covered call option writer cannot effect a closing transaction it cannot sell the underlying security or foreign currency until the option expires or the option is exercised therefore the writer of a covered otc call option may not be able to sell an underlying security even though it might otherwise be advantageous to do so likewise the writer of a secured otc put option may be unable to sell the securities pledged to secure the put for other investment purposes while it is obligated as a put writer similarly a purchaser of an otc put or call option might also find it difficult to terminate its position on a timely basis in the absence of a secondary market the staff of the securities and exchange commission has often taken the position that purchased otc options and the assets used to cover written otc options are illiquid securities the portfolios will adopt procedures for engaging in otc options transactions for the purpose of reducing any potential adverse effect of such transactions on the liquidity of the portfolios futures contracts the portfolios may buy and sell stock index futures contracts traded on domestic stock exchanges to hedge the value of its portfolio against changes in market conditions a stock index futures contract is an agreement between two parties to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to a specified dollar amount times the difference between the stock index value at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the futures contract is originally struck a stock index futures contract does not involve the physical delivery of the underlying stocks in the index although stock index futures contracts call for the actual taking or delivery or cash in most cases a portfolio expects to liquidate its stock index futures positions through offsetting transactions which may result in a gain or a loss before cash settlement is required each portfolio will incur brokerage fees when it purchases and sells stock index futures contracts and at the time a portfolio purchases or sells a stock index futures contract it must make a good faith deposit known as the initial margin thereafter a portfolio may need to make subsequent deposits known as variation margin to reflect changes in the level of the stock index each portfolio may buy or sell a stock index futures contract so long as the sum of the amount of margin deposits on open positions with respect to all stock index futures contracts does not exceed  of a portfolios net assets to the extent a portfolio enters into a stock index futures contract it will maintain with its custodian bank to the extent required by the rules of the sec assets in a segregated account to cover its obligations such assets may consist of cash cash equivalents or high quality debt securities from its portfolio in an amount equal to the difference between the fluctuating market value of such futures contract and the aggregate value of the initial and variation margin payments risks associated with options and futures although the portfolios may write covered call options and purchase and sell stock index futures contracts to hedge against declines in market value of their portfolio securities the use of these instruments involves certain risks as the writer of covered call options each portfolio receives a premium but loses any opportunity to profit from an increase in the market price of the underlying securities declines though the premium received may partially offset such loss although stock index futures contracts may be useful in hedging against adverse changes in the value of each portfolios investment securities they are derivative instruments that are subject to a number of risks during certain market conditions purchases and sales of stock index futures contracts may not completely offset a decline or rise in the value of each portfolios investments in the futures markets it may not always be possible to execute a buy or sell order at the desired price or to close out an open position due to market conditions limits on open positions andor daily price fluctuations changes in the market value of each portfolios investment securities may differ substantially from the changes anticipated by a portfolio when it established its hedged positions and unanticipated price movements in a futures contract may result in a loss substantially greater than such portfolios initial investment in such a contract successful use of futures contracts depends upon the subadvisers ability to correctly predict movements in the securities markets generally or of a particular segment of a securities market no assurance can be given that the subadvisers judgment in this respect will be correct the cftc and the various exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or net short position that any person may hold or control in a particular futures contract trading limits are imposed on the number of contracts that any person may trade on a particular trading day an exchange may order the liquidation of positions found to be in violation of these limits and it may impose sanctions or restrictions these trading and positions limits will not have an adverse impact on a portfolios strategies for hedging its securities investment policies and risks of the kinetics government money market portfolio the following paragraphs provide a more detailed description of the kinetics government money market portfolios for the purpose of this section the portfolio investment policies and risks identified in the prospectus unless otherwise noted the policies described below are not fundamental and may be changed by the board of trustees of the trust without shareholder approval repurchase agreements the portfolio may invest in repurchase agreements which are arrangements with banks brokersdealers and other recognized financial institutions to sell securities to the portfolio and to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon time and price within one year from the date of acquisition the portfolio or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to the terms of the repurchase agreements and these securities will be marked to market daily to the extent that the original seller does not repurchase the securities from the portfolio the portfolio could receive less than the repurchase price on any sale of such securities in the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became insolvent disposition of such securities by the portfolio might be delayed pending court action the portfolio believes that under the regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the portfolios assets subject to repurchase agreements a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the portfolio and allow retention or disposition of such securities the portfolio will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as brokerdealers which are deemed by the portfolios adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to guidelines established by the board of trustees whenissued and delayed delivery transactions the portfolio may purchase shortterm obligations on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis these transactions are arrangements in which the portfolio purchases securities with payment and delivery scheduled for a future time the sellers failure to complete these transactions may cause the portfolio to miss a price or yield considered advantageous settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices the portfolio may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the investment adviser deems it appropriate to do so in addition the portfolio may enter into transactions to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current market values and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar securities at later dates the portfolio may realize shortterm profits or losses upon the sale of such commitments these transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price or yield for the portfolio no fees or other expenses other than normal transaction costs are incurred however liquid assets of the portfolio sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased are segregated on the portfolios records at the trade date these assets are marked to market daily and are maintained until the transaction is settled the portfolio does not intend to engage in whenissued and delayed delivery transactions to an extent that would cause the segregation of more than  of the total value of its assets other money market funds as an efficient means of carrying out the investment policies the portfolio may invest in the securities of other money market funds a disadvantage to investing in other money market funds is that they also carry certain expenses such as management fees as a result any investment by the portfolio in shares of other money market funds may duplicate certain shareholder expenses more about the asia technology portfolios investment in technology and science driven companies the subadviser for the asia technology portfolio believes that because of rapid advances in technology science and biotechnology an investment in companies with business operations in these areas will offer substantial opportunities for longterm capital appreciation of course prices of common stocks of even the best managed most profitable corporations are subject to market risk which means their stock prices can decline in addition swings in investor psychology or significant trading by large institutional investors can result in price fluctuations industries likely to be represented in the portfolio include the internet computers networking and internetworking software computer aided design telecommunications media and information services medical devices and biotechnology the portfolio may also invest in the stocks of companies that should benefit from the commercialization of technological advances although they may not be directly involved in research and development the technology science and biotechnology areas have exhibited and continue to exhibit rapid growth due to the mass adoption of the internet both through increasing demand for existing products and services and the broadening of the technology market in general the stocks of large capitalized companies that are well established in the technology market can be expected to grow with the market and will frequently be found in the portfolios cache of investment securities the expansion of technology and its related industries however also provides a favorable environment for investment in small to medium capitalized companies the portfolios investment policies are not limited to any minimum capitalization requirement and the portfolio may hold securities without regard to the capitalization of the issuer the subadvisers overall stock selection for the portfolio is not based on the capitalization or size of the company but rather on an assessment of the companys fundamental prospects companies in the rapidly changing fields of technology science and biotechnology face special risks for example their products or services may not prove commercially successful or may become obsolete quickly the value of the portfolios shares may be susceptible to factors affecting the technology and science areas and to greater risk and market fluctuation than an investment in a fund that invests in a broader range of portfolio securities not concentrated in any particular industry as such the portfolio is not an appropriate investment for individuals who are not longterm investors and who as their primary objective require safety of principal or stable income from their investments the technology science and biotechnology areas may be subject to greater governmental regulation than many other areas and changes in governmental policies and the need for regulatory approvals may have a material adverse effect on these areas additionally companies in these areas may be subject to risks of developing technologies competitive pressures and other factors and are dependent upon consumer and business acceptance as new technologies evolve temporary investments due to the changing nature of the internet

of deposit purchased by the portfolios will be those of us banks having total assets at the time of purchase in excess of  billion and bankers acceptances purchased by the portfolios will be

cash at any given time except when the portfolios are in a temporary defensive posture portfolio turnover in order to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment afforded regulated investment companies and to be relieved of federal tax liabilities both the funds and the portfolios must distribute substantially all of their net income to shareholders generally on an annual basis thus the portfolios may have to dispose of portfolio securities under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash or borrow cash in order to satisfy the distribution requirement the portfolios do not trade in

portfolio securities and for taking all steps necessary to implement securities transactions on behalf of the portfolios transactions on us stock exchanges commodities markets and futures markets and other agency transactions may involve the payment by the adviser on behalf of the portfolios of negotiated brokerage commissions such commissions vary among different brokers a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction transactions in foreign investments often involve the payment of fixed brokerage commissions which may be higher than those in the united states there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded in the overthecounter markets but the price paid by the adviser usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup in underwritten offerings the price paid by the adviser on behalf of the portfolios includes a disclosed fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer us government securities generally are traded in the overthecounter market through brokerdealers a brokerdealer is a securities firm or bank that makes a market for securities by offering to buy at one price and sell at a slightly higher price the difference between the prices is known as a spread in placing orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the portfolios the adviser seeks to obtain the best price and execution taking into account such factors as price size of order difficulty and risk of execution and operational facilities of the firm involved for securities traded in the overthecounter markets the adviser deals directly with the dealers who make markets in these securities unless better prices and execution are available elsewhere the adviser negotiates commission rates with brokers based on the quality and quantity of services provided in light of generally prevailing rates and while the adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive commission rates the portfolio does not necessarily pay the lowest commissions available the board of trustees periodically reviews the commission rates and allocation of orders when consistent with the objectives of best price and execution business may be placed with brokerdealers who furnish investment research or services to the adviser such research or services include advice both orally and in writing as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities as well as analyses and reports concerning issues industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts to the extent portfolio transactions are effected with brokerdealers who furnish research services to the adviser the adviser receives a benefit not capable of evaluation in dollar amounts without providing any direct monetary benefit to the portfolio from these transactions the adviser believes that most research services obtained by it generally benefit several or all of the investment companies and private accounts which it manages as opposed to solely benefiting one specific managed fund or account the trust on behalf of a portfolio may also enter into arrangements commonly referred to as brokerservice arrangements with brokerdealers pursuant to which a brokerdealer agrees to pay the cost of certain products or services provided to the portfolio in exchange for fund brokerage under a typical brokerageservice arrangement a broker agrees to pay a portion the portfolios custodian administrative or transfer agency fees etc and in exchange the portfolio agrees to direct a minimum amount of brokerage to the broker the adviser on behalf of the trust usually negotiates the terms of the contract with the service provider which is paid directly by the broker the same security may be suitable for a portfolio another portfolio series of the trust or other private accounts managed by the adviser if and when a portfolio and two or more accounts simultaneously purchase or sell the same security the transactions will be allocated as to price and amount in accordance with arrangements equitable to the portfolios and the accounts the simultaneous purchase or sale of the same securities by a portfolio and other accounts may have a detrimental effect on a portfolio as this may affect the price paid or received by a portfolio or the size of the position obtainable or able to be sold by a portfolio consistent with the conduct rules of the national association of securities dealers inc and subject to seeking the most favorable price and execution available and such other policies as the trustees may determine the adviser may consider sales of shares of a portfolio as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for a portfolio taxes the portfolios will be classified for federal income tax purposes as partnerships that are not publicly traded partnerships as a result the portfolios are not subject to federal income tax instead each interestholder in a portfolio is required to take into account in determining its federal income tax liability its share of the particular portfolios income gains losses deductions and credits without regard to whether it has received any cash distributions from a portfolio the portfolios are also not subject to delaware income or franchise tax a holder of beneficial interest in a portfolio an interestholder is deemed to own a proportionate share of that portfolios assets and to earn a proportionate share of that portfolios income for among other things purposes of determining whether the interestholder satisfies the requirements to qualify as a regulated investment company ric accordingly the portfolios intend to conduct their operations so that their interestholders that invest substantially all of their assets in a portfolio and intend to qualify as rics should be able to satisfy all those requirements distributions to an interestholder from a portfolio whether pursuant to a partial or complete withdrawal or otherwise will not result in the interestholders recognition of any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes except that  gain will be recognized to the extent any cash that is distributed exceeds the interestholders basis for its interest in a portfolio before the distribution  income or gain will be recognized if the distribution is in liquidation of the interestholders entire interest in a portfolio and includes a disproportionate share of any unrealized receivables held by a portfolio  loss will be recognized to the extent that a liquidation distribution consisting solely of cash andor unrealized receivables is less than the interestholders basis for its interest in a portfolio prior to the distribution and  gain or loss may be recognized on a distribution to an interestholder that contributed property to a portfolio an interestholders basis for its interest in a portfolio generally will equal the amount of cash and the basis of any property it invests in a portfolio increased by the interestholders share of that portfolios net income and gains and decreased by a the amount of cash and the basis of any property the portfolio distributes to the interestholder and b the interestholders share of the portfolios losses the income tax and estate tax consequences to a nonus interestholder entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may be different from those described herein nonus interestholders may be required to provide appropriate documentation to establish their entitlement to the benefits of such a treaty nonus

the foregoing formula the time periods used in advertising will be based on rolling calendar quarters updated to the last day of the most recent quarter prior to submission of the advertising for

the ending redeemable value average annual total return assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and distributions cumulative total return cumulative total return represents the simple change in value of an investment over a stated period and may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount total returns may be broken down into their components of income and capital including capital gains and changes in share price in order to illustrate the relationship between these factors and their contributions to total return yield annualized yield quotations used in a portfolios advertising and

characteristics as well babonds which are ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class bbonds which are rated b generally lack characteristics of a desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small caabonds which are rated caa are of poor standing such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest cabonds which are ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings cbonds which are rated c are the lowest rated class of bonds and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real investment standing fitch investors service inc bond rating definitions aaabonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality the obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and repay principal which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events aabonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong although not quite as strong as bonds rated aaa because bonds rated in the aaa and aa categories are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable future developments shortterm debt of these issuers is generally rated f abonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered strong but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings bbbbonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be adequate adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances however are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds and therefore impair timely payment the likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings bbbonds are considered speculative the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes however business and financial alternatives can be identified which could assist the obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements bbonds are considered highly speculative while bonds in this class are currently meeting debt service requirements the probability of continued timely payment of principal and interest reflects the obligors limited margin of safety and the need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the life of the issue cccbonds have certain identifiable characteristics which if not remedied may lead to default the ability to meet obligations requires an advantageous business and economic environment ccbonds are minimally protected default in payment of interest andor principal seems probable over time cbonds are in imminent default in payment of interest or principal ddd dd and dbonds are in default on interest andor principal payments such bonds are extremely speculative and should be valued on the basis of their ultimate recovery value in liquidation or reorganization of the obligor ddd represents the highest potential for recovery on these bonds and d represents the lowest potential for recovery kinetics portfolios trust part c other

the government money market portfolio is to provide current income consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity � principal investment strategies the government money market portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all of its net assets in high quality us dollardenominated shortterm obligations that have been determined by the investment adviser subject to the approval of the portfolio�s board of trustees to present minimal credit risk the portfolio does not invest in obligations with maturities of more than  days subject to certain exceptions and the average maturity of all obligations held by the portfolio must be  days or less the t portfolio invests exclusively in obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by such obligations �us government securities� us government securities include direct obligations of the us treasury such as treasury bills treasury notes and treasury bonds the portfolio seeks to maintain a constant  net asset value per share � us government securities are high quality instruments guaranteed as to principal and interest and issued by the us treasury or by an agency or instrumentality of the us government not all us government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states some are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury others are backed by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase the agencies� obligations while others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality in the case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states the portfolio must look principally to the agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment � yields on short intermediate and longterm us government securities are dependent on a variety of factors including the general conditions of the money and bond markets the size of a particular offering and the maturity of the obligation debt securities with longer maturities tend to produce higher capital appreciation and depreciation than do obligations with shorter maturities and lower yields the market value of us government securities generally varies inversely with changes in interest rates an increase in interest rates therefore generally would reduce the market value of the portfolio�s investments in us government securities while a decline in interest rates generally would increase the market value of the portfolio�s investments in these securities � under a repurchase agreement the portfolio purchases a us government security and simultaneously agrees to sell the security back to the seller at a mutually agreedupon future price and date normally one day or a few days later the resale price is greater than the purchase price reflecting an agreedupon market interest rate premium during the portfolio�s holding period while the maturities of the underlying securities in repurchase agreement transactions may be more than one year the term of each repurchase agreement will always be less than one year the portfolio may enter into repurchase agreements with banks that are members of federal reserve system or securities dealers who are members of a national securities exchange or are primary dealers in us government securities the investment adviser monitors the creditworthiness of each firm that is a party to a repurchase agreement with the portfolio � principal risks of investment the principal risks of investing in the portfolio are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value total return and value of the portfolio and your investment � ��� interest rate risks the rate of income will vary from day to day depending on shortterm interest rates it is possible that a major change in interest rates could cause the value of your investment to decline the values of the obligations held by the portfolio can be expected to vary inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates although the investment policies of the portfolio are designed to minimize these changes and to maintain a net asset value of  per share there is no assurance that these policies will be successful � � � � � � ��� credit risks changes in the credit quality rating or changes in an issuer�s financial condition can also affect the portfolio a default on a security held or a repurchase agreement entered into by the portfolio could cause the value of your investment in the portfolio to decline � ��� repurchase agreement risks one of the risks of investing in repurchase agreements is that the seller may not repurchase the securities from the portfolio which may result in the portfolio selling the securities for less than the price agreed upon with the seller another risk of repurchase agreements is that the seller may default or file for bankruptcy under such circumstances the portfolio will liquidate those securities held under the repurchase agreement which securities constitute collateral for the seller�s obligation to repurchase the securities although the portfolio might have to wait through lengthy court actions before selling the securities � � � � � � � main risks of the portfolios � the principal risks of investing in each portfolio are described previously in this prospectus the following section provides more detail about some of those risks along with information on additional types of risks that may apply to the portfolios � investing in mutual funds�all portfolios all mutual funds carry risks that may cause you to lose money on your investment in one or more of the portfolios the following describes the primary risks to each portfolio based on each portfolio�s specific investment objective and strategies as all investment securities are subject to inherent market risks and fluctuations in value due to earnings economic and political conditions and other factors no portfolio can give assurance that its investment objective will be achieved � portfolio turnover rate risk � all portfolios under certain circumstances a portfolio may take advantage of shortterm trading opportunities without regard to the length of time its securities have been held this strategy often calls for frequent trading of a portfolio�s securities in order to take advantage of anticipated changes in market conditions frequent trading by the portfolio could increase the rate of its portfolio turnover which would involve correspondingly greater expenses such expenses may include brokerage commissions or dealer markupsmarkdowns as well as other transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestments in other securities such sales also may result in adverse tax consequences to shareholders if a portfolio realizes capital gains when it sells its portfolio investments it must generally pay those gains out to shareholders increasing their taxable distributions the trading costs and tax effects associated with such portfolio turnover may adversely affect portfolio performance under these circumstances and large movements of assets into and out of a portfolio may negatively impact such portfolio�s ability to achieve its investment objective or current level of operating expenses � market risk�all portfolios other than the government money market portfolio the net asset value of each portfolio will fluctuate based on changes in the value of its underlying portfolio the stock market is generally susceptible to volatile fluctuations in market price market prices of securities in which each portfolio invests may be adversely affected by an issuer�s having experienced losses or by the lack of earnings or by the issuer�s failure to meet the market�s expectations with respect to new products or services or even by factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of the issuer the value of the securities held by the portfolios is also subject to the risk that a specific segment of the stock market does not perform as well as the overall market under any of these circumstances the value of each portfolio�s shares and total return will fluctuate and your investment may be worth more or less than your original cost when you redeem your shares � internet industry specific risks�the internet portfolio and the emerging growth portfolio the value of each portfolio�s shares will be susceptible to factors affecting the internet such as heightened regulatory scrutiny and impending changes in government policies which may have a material effect on the products and services of this industry furthermore securities of companies in this industry tend to be more volatile than securities of companies in other industries competitive pressures and changing demand may have a significant effect on the financial condition of internet companies these companies spend heavily on research and development and are especially sensitive to the risk of product obsolescence the occurrence of any of these factors individually or collectively may adversely affect the value of a portfolio�s shares � � � � � � � medical research industryspecific risks�the medical portfolio medical and pharmaceuticalrelated companies in general are subject to the rate of change in technology which is generally higher than that of other industries similarly cancer researchrelated industries use many products and services of companies engaged in medical and pharmaceuticalrelated activities and are also subject to relatively high risks of rapid obsolescence caused by progressive scientific and technological advances medical research and development is also subject to strict regulatory scrutiny and ongoing legislative action � securities lending�all portfolios other than the government money market portfolio each portfolio may lend its portfolio securities to brokerdealers by entering directly into lending arrangements with such brokerdealers amounting to no more than   of the total assets of each portfolio including any collateral posted or  of the total assets of each portfolio excluding any collateral posted repurchase transactions will be fully collateralized at all times with cash andor shortterm debt obligations these transactions involve some risk to a portfolio if the other party should default on its obligation and the portfolio is delayed or prevented from recovering the collateral in the event that the original seller defaults on its obligation to repurchase a portfolio will seek to sell the collateral which could involve costs or delays to the extent proceeds from the sale of collateral are less than the repurchase price each portfolio forced to sell such collateral in this manner would suffer a loss � nondiversification�all portfolios other than the government money market portfolio each portfolio is classified as �nondiversified� under federal securities laws which means that onehalf of each portfolio�s assets may be invested in the stocks of two or more issuers not exceeding  of a portfolio�s total assets with respect to any one issuer while the other half is spread out among investments of various issuers generally not exceeding with respect to any issuer  of a portfolio�s total assets as a result of its nondiversified status a portfolio�s shares may be more susceptible to adverse changes in the value of the securities of a particular company than would be the shares of a diversified investment company � investment in small and mediumsize companies�all portfolios other than the government money market portfolio each portfolio may invest in small or mediumsize companies accordingly a portfolio may be subject to the additional risks associated with investment in companies with small or mediumsize capital structures generally a market capitalization of  billion or less the market prices of the securities of such companies tend to be more volatile than those of larger companies further these securities tend to trade at a lower volume than those of larger more established companies if a portfolio is heavily invested in these securities and the value of these securities suddenly declines the net asset value of the portfolio will be more susceptible to significant losses � foreign securities�all portfolios other than the government money market portfolio investing in foreign securities can carry higher returns than those generally associated with us investments however foreign securities may be substantially riskier than us investments the economies of foreign countries may differ from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product rate of inflation currency depreciation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position furthermore the economies of developing countries generally are heavily dependent on international trade and accordingly have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers exchange controls managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protective measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade these economies also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade a portfolio may be required to obtain prior governmental approval for foreign investments in some countries under certain circumstances governments may require approval to invest in certain issuers or industries deemed sensitive to national interests and the extent of foreign investment in certain debt securities and companies may be subject to limitation individual companies may also limit foreign ownership to prevent among other things violation of foreign investment limitations � some foreign investments may risk being subject to repatriation controls that could render such securities illiquid other countries might undergo nationalization expropriation political changes governmental regulation social instability or diplomatic developments including war that could adversely affect the economies of such countries or the value of the investments in those countries for this reason portfolios that invest primarily in the securities of a single country will be greatly impacted by any political economic or regulatory developments affecting the value of the securities additional risks include currency fluctuations political and economic instability differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets � � � � � � � portfolio borrowing�all portfolios each portfolio may leverage up to  of its assets to portfolio investment activities or to achieve higher returns each portfolio may borrow money from banks for temporary or emergency purposes in order to meet redemption requests to reduce its indebtedness a portfolio may have to sell a portion of its investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so in addition interest paid by a portfolio on borrowed funds would decrease the net earnings of the portfolio � derivatives risk�all portfolios other than the government money market portfolio each portfolio may invest in derivatives such as options and futures the successful use of these investment practices depends on the portfolio managers ability to forecast stock price movements andor currency exchange rate movements correctly should stock prices or exchange rates move unexpectedly a portfolio may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions or may realize losses and thus be in a worse position than if such strategies had not been used unlike many exchangetraded futures contracts and options on futures contracts there are no daily price fluctuation limits for certain options and forward contracts and adverse market movements could therefore continue to an unlimited extent over a period of time in addition the correlation between movements in the prices of futures contracts options and forward contracts and movements in the prices of the securities and currencies hedged or used for cover will not be perfect and could produce unanticipated losses � a portfolio�s ability to dispose of its positions in futures contracts options and forward contracts depends on the availability of liquid markets in such instruments markets in options and futures with respect to a number of types of securities and currencies are relatively new and still developing and there is no public market for forward contracts it is impossible to predict the amount of trading interest that may exist in various types of futures contracts options and forward contracts if a secondary market does not exist for an option purchased or written by a portfolio it might not be possible to effect a closing transaction in the option ie dispose of the option with the result that  an option purchased by a portfolio would have to be exercised in order for the portfolio to realize any profit and  a portfolio may not be able to sell currencies or portfolio securities covering an option written by the portfolio until the option expires or it delivers the underlying security futures contract or currency upon exercise therefore no assurance can be given that the portfolios will be able to utilize these instruments effectively in addition a portfolios ability to engage in options and futures transactions may be limited by tax considerations and the use of certain hedging techniques may adversely impact the characterization of income to the portfolio for us federal income tax purposes � investing in investment grade debt securities and below investment grade debt securities� all portfolios other than the government money market portfolio investments in debt securities pose different risks the value of fixed income securities generally will fall if interest rates rise the value of these securities may also fall as a result of other factors such as the performance of the issuer the market perception of the issuer or general economic conditions these investments also involve a risk that the issuer may not be able to meet its principal and interest payment obligations fixed income securities having longer maturities involve greater risk of fluctuations in value � investments in debt securities rated below investment grade ie junk bonds and unrated securities of comparable quality are subject to the increased risk of an issuer�s inability to meet principal and interest payment obligations these securities may be subject to greater price volatility due to such factors as specific corporate or municipal developments interest rate sensitivity negative perceptions of the junk bond markets generally and less secondary market liquidity � � � � � � � portfolio holdings information � a description of the portfolios�

procedures approved by the board of trustees each portfolio other than the government money market portfolio may use independent pricing services to assist in calculating the nav of such portfolio � attempts to determine the fair value of securities introduce an element of subjectivity to the pricing of securities as a result the price of a security determined through fair valuation techniques may differ from the price quoted or published by other sources and may not accurately reflect the market value of the security when trading resumes the government money market portfolio will utilize the amortized cost method in valuing its portfolio securities this method involves valuing a security at its cost adjusted by a constant amortization of maturity of any discount or premium regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument the purpose of this method of calculation is to facilitate the maintenance of a consistent net asset value per share for the government money market portfolio of  however there is no assurance that the  net asset value per share will be maintained � attempts to determine the fair value of securities introduce an element of subjectivity to the pricing of securities as a result the price of a security determined through fair valuation techniques may differ from the price quoted or published by other sources and

ownership of a corporation preferred stocks are stocks that often pay dividends at a specific rate and have a preference over common stocks in dividend payments and liquidation of assets some preferred stocks may be convertible into common stock convertible securities are securities that may be converted into or exchanged for a specified amount of common stock of the same or different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula � � � � � � debt securities the portfolios other than the kinetics government money market portfolio may invest in convertible and nonconvertible debt obligations without regard to rating and as a result may purchase or hold securities in the lowest rating categories debt securities in the lowest investment grade categories are considered to be below investment grade securities that may not have adequate capacity to pay principal or that otherwise generally lack the characteristics of desirable investments as compared to debt securities with higher ratings these �high risk� securities are vulnerable to nonpayment and depend to a larger degree upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation at no time will the portfolios have more than  of their respective total assets invested in any debt securities that are rated below investment grade or if the security is unrated of comparable quality as determined by a portfolio�s adviser either at the time of purchase or as a result of a reduction in rating after purchase please see �appendix� to this statement of additional information for a description of debt security ratings � whenissued and delayed delivery transactions the portfolios including the kinetics government money market portfolio may purchase shortterm obligations on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis these transactions are arrangements in which the portfolios purchase securities with payment and delivery scheduled for a future time the seller�s failure to complete these transactions may cause the portfolios to miss a price or yield considered advantageous settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices the portfolios may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the adviser deems it appropriate to do so in addition each portfolio may enter into transactions to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current market values and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar securities at later dates a portfolio may realize shortterm profits or losses upon the sale of such commitments these transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price or yield for a portfolio no fees or other expenses other than normal transaction costs are incurred however liquid assets of the portfolio sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased are segregated on the portfolio�s records at the trade date these assets are marked to market daily and are maintained until the transaction is settled the portfolios do not intend to engage in whenissued and delayed delivery transactions to an extent that would cause the segregation of more than  of the total value of their assets � repurchase agreements the kinetics government money market portfolio may invest in repurchase agreements which are arrangements with banks brokerdealers and other recognized financial institutions to sell securities to the portfolio and to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon time and price within one year from the date of acquisition the portfolio or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to the terms of the repurchase agreements and these securities will be marked to market daily to the extent that the original seller does not repurchase the securities from the portfolio the portfolio could receive less than the repurchase price on any sale of such securities in the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became insolvent disposition of such securities by the portfolio might be delayed pending court action the portfolio believes that under the regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the portfolio�s assets subject to repurchase agreements a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the portfolio and allow retention or disposition of such securities the portfolio will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as brokerdealers which are deemed by the portfolio�s adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to guidelines established by the board of trustees � � � � � � other money market funds as an efficient means of carrying out its investment policies the kinetics government money market portfolio may invest in the securities of other money market funds a disadvantage to investing in other money market funds is that they also carry certain expenses such as management fees as a result any investment by the portfolio in shares of other money market funds may duplicate certain shareholder expenses � restricted and illiquid securities each portfolio�may invest in a limited amount of restricted securities restricted securities are any securities in which the portfolios may invest pursuant to their investment objective and policies but which are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities laws an illiquid asset is any asset which may not be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at approximately the value at which the portfolio has valued the investment � fixedincome securities the fixedincome securities in which the portfolios may invest are generally subject to two kinds of risk credit risk and market risk credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer to meet interest and principal payments as they become due the ratings given a security by moody�s and sp provide a generally useful guide as to such credit risk the lower the rating given a security by such rating service the greater the credit risk such rating service perceives to exist with respect to such security increasing the amount of portfolio assets invested in unrated or lowergrade securities while intended to increase the yield produced by those assets will also increase the credit risk to which those assets are subject market risk all mutual funds are affected by changes in the economy and swings in investment markets these can occur within or outside the us or worldwide and may affect only particular companies or industries depositary receipts the portfolios may invest in american depositary receipts �adrs� or other forms of depositary receipts such as international depositary receipts �idrs� depositary receipts are typically issued in connection with a us or foreign bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation investments in these types of securities involve certain inherent risks generally associated with investments in foreign securities including the following political and economic factors individual foreign economies of certain countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from the united states economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency diversification and balance of payments position the internal politics of certain foreign countries may not be as stable as those of the united states governments in certain foreign countries also continue to participate to a significant degree through ownership interest or regulation in their respective economies action by these governments could include restrictions on foreign investment nationalization expropriation of goods or imposition of taxes and could have a significant effect on market prices of securities and payment of interest the economies of many foreign countries are heavily dependent upon international trade and are accordingly affected by the trade policies and economic conditions of their trading partners enactment by these trading partners of protectionist trade legislation could have a significant adverse effect upon the securities markets of such countries � � � � � � currency fluctuations a change in the value of any foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a corresponding change in the us dollar value of an adr�s underlying portfolio securities denominated in that currency such changes will affect a portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is invested in adrs comprised of foreign securities taxes the interest and dividends payable on certain foreign securities comprising an adr may be subject to foreign withholding taxes thus reducing the net amount of income to be paid to the portfolios and that may ultimately be available for distribution to the portfolio�s shareholders � derivatives buying call and put options the portfolios except the kinetics government money market portfolio may purchase call options such transactions may be entered into in order to limit the risk of a substantial increase in the market price of the security that each portfolio intends to purchase prior to its expiration a call option may be sold in a closing sale transaction any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the call option plus the related transaction cost the portfolios may purchase put options by buying a put each portfolio has the right to sell the security at the exercise price thus limiting its risk of loss through a decline in the market value of the security until the put expires the amount of any appreciation in the value of the underlying security will be partially offset by the amount of the premium paid for the put option and any related transaction cost prior to its expiration a put option may be sold in a closing sale transaction and any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the put option plus the related transaction costs writing selling call and put options each portfolio except the kinetics government money market portfolio may write covered options on equity and debt securities and indices this means that in the case of call options so long as each portfolio is obligated as the writer of a call option it will own the underlying security subject to the option and in the case of put options it will through its custodian deposit and maintain either cash or securities with a market value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the option covered call options written by a portfolio give the holder the right to buy the underlying securities from the portfolio at a stated exercise price a call option written by a portfolio is �covered� if the portfolios owns the underlying security that is subject to the call or have an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration or for additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its custodian bank upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio a call option is also covered if a portfolio holds a call on the same security and in the same principal amount as the call written where the exercise price of the call held a�is equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or b�is greater than the exercise price of the call written if the difference is maintained by the portfolio in cash and high grade debt securities in a segregated account with their custodian bank the portfolios may purchase securities which may be covered with call options solely on the basis of considerations consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the portfolios a portfolio�s turnover may increase through the exercise of a call option this will generally occur if the market value of a �covered� security increases and the portfolio has not entered in to a closing purchase transaction as a writer of an option each portfolio receives a premium less a commission and in exchange foregoes the opportunity to profit from any increase in the market value of the security exceeding the call option price the premium serves to mitigate the effect of any depreciation in the market value of the security the premium paid by the buyer of an option will reflect among other things the relationship of the exercise price to the market price the volatility of the underlying security the remaining term of the option the existing supply and demand and the interest rates � � � � � the writer of a call option may have no control over when the underlying securities must be sold because the writer may be assigned an exercise notice at any time prior to the termination of the obligation exercise of a call option by the purchaser will cause a portfolio to forego future appreciation of the securities covered by the option whether or not an option expires unexercised the writer retains the amount of the premium this amount may in the case of a covered call option be offset by a decline in the market value of the underlying security during the option period if a call option is exercised the writer experiences a profit or loss from the sale of the underlying security thus during the option period the writer of a call option gives up the opportunity for appreciation in the market value of the underlying security or currency above the exercise price it retains the risk of the loss should the price of the underlying security or foreign currency decline writing call options also involves risks relating to a portfolio�s ability to close out the option it has written each portfolio may write exchangetraded call options on its securities call options may be written on portfolio securities indices or foreign currencies with respect to securities and foreign currencies the portfolio may write call and put options on an exchange or overthecounter call options on portfolio securities will be covered since the portfolio will own the underlying securities call options on securities indices will be written only to hedge in an economically appropriate way portfolio securities that are not otherwise hedged with options or financial futures contracts and will be �covered� by identifying the specific portfolio securities being hedged options on foreign currencies will be covered by securities denominated in that currency options on securities indices will be covered by securities that substantially replicate the movement of the index a put option on a security security index or foreign currency gives the purchaser of the option in return for the premium paid to the writer seller the right to sell the underlying security index or foreign currency at the exercise price at any time during the option period when a portfolio writes a secured put option it will gain a profit in the amount of the premium less a commission so long as the price of the underlying security remains above the exercise price however a portfolio remains obligated to purchase the underlying security from the buyer of the put option usually in the event the price of the security falls bellows the exercise price at any time during the option period if the price of the underlying security falls below the exercise price the portfolios may realize a loss in the amount of the difference between the exercise price and the sale price of the security less the premium received upon exercise by the purchaser the writer of a put option has the obligation to purchase the underlying security or foreign currency at the exercise price a put option on a securities index is similar to a put option on an individual security except that the value of the option depends on the weighted value of the group of securities comprising the index and all settlements are made in cash during the option period the writer of a put option has assumed the risk that the price of the underlying security or foreign currency will decline below the exercise price however the writer of the put option has retained the opportunity for an appreciated above the exercise price should the market price of the underlying security or foreign currency increase writing put options also involves risks relating to a portfolio�s ability to close out the option that it has written the writer of an option who wishes to terminate its obligation may effect a �closing purchase transaction� by buying an option of the same series as the option previously written the effect of the purchase is that the clearing corporation will cancel the writer�s position however a writer may not effect a closing purchase transaction after being notified of the exercise of an option there is also no guarantee that a portfolio will be able to effect a closing purchase transaction for the options it has written effecting a closing purchase transaction in the case of a written call option will permit a portfolio to write another call option on the underlying security with a different exercise price expiration date or both effecting a closing purchase transaction will also permit a portfolio to use cash or proceeds from the investments if a portfolio desires to sell a particular security from its portfolio on which it has written a call option it will effect a closing purchase transaction before or at the same time as the sale of the security � � � � � a portfolio will realize a profit from a closing purchase transaction if the price of the transaction is less than the premium received from writing the option likewise a portfolio will realize a loss from a closing purchase transaction if the price of the transaction is more than the premium received from writing the option because increases in the market price of a call option will generally reflect increases in the market price of the underlying security any loss resulting from the repurchase of a call option is likely to be offset in whole or in part by appreciation of the underlying security owned by the portfolio writing overthecounter �otc� options each portfolio except the kinetics government money market portfolio may engage in options transactions that trade on the otc market to the same extent that it intends to engage in exchangetraded options just as with exchangetraded options otc options give the holder the right to buy an underlying security from or sell an underlying security to an option writer at a stated exercise price however otc options differ from exchangetraded options in certain material respects otc options are arranged directly with dealers and not as is the case with exchangetraded options through a clearing corporation thus there is a risk of nonperformance by the dealer because there is no exchange pricing is typically done by reference to information obtained from market makers since otc options are available for a greater variety of securities and in a wider range of expiration dates and exercise prices the writer of an otc option is paid the premium in advance by the dealer a writer or purchaser of a put or call option can terminate it voluntarily only by entering into a closing transaction there can be no assurance that a continuously liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option at any specific time consequently a portfolio may be able to realize the value of an otc option it has purchased only by exercising it or entering into a closing sale transaction with the dealer that issued it similarly when a portfolio writes an otc option it generally can close out that option prior to its expiration only by entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer to which it originally wrote to option if a covered call option writer cannot effect a closing transaction it cannot sell the underlying security or foreign currency until the option expires or the option is exercised therefore the writer of a covered otc call option may not be able to sell an underlying security even though it might otherwise be advantageous to do so likewise the writer of a secured otc put option may be unable to sell the securities pledged to secure the put for other investment purposes while it is obligated as a put writer similarly a purchaser of an otc put or call option might also find it difficult to terminate its position on a timely basis in the absence of a secondary market the staff of the securities and exchange commission �sec� has often taken the position that purchased otc options and the assets used to �cover� written otc options are illiquid securities the portfolios will adopt procedures for engaging in otc options transactions for the purpose of reducing any potential adverse effect of such transactions on the liquidity of the portfolios futures contracts each portfolio except the kinetics government money market portfolio�may buy and sell stock index futures contracts traded on domestic stock exchanges to hedge the value of its portfolio against changes in market conditions a stock index futures contract is an agreement between two parties to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to a specified dollar amount times the difference between the stock index value at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the futures contract is originally struck a stock index futures contract does not involve the physical delivery of the underlying stocks in the index although stock index futures contracts call for the actual taking or delivery of cash in most cases each portfolio expects to liquidate its stock index futures positions through offsetting transactions which may result in a gain or a loss before cash settlement is required each portfolio will incur brokerage fees when it purchases and sells stock index futures contracts and at the time a portfolio purchases or sells a stock index futures contract it must make a good faith deposit known as the �initial margin� thereafter a portfolio may need to make subsequent deposits known as �variation margin� to reflect changes in the level of the stock index each portfolio may buy or sell a stock index futures contract so long as the sum of the amount of margin deposits on open positions with respect to all stock index futures contracts does not exceed  of the portfolio�s net assets � � � � � to the extent a portfolio enters into a stock index futures contract it will maintain with its custodian bank to the extent required by the rules of the sec assets in a segregated account to cover its obligations such assets may consist of cash cash equivalents or high quality debt securities from its portfolio in an amount equal to the difference between the fluctuating market value of such futures contract and the aggregate value of the initial and variation margin payments risks associated with options and futures although each portfolio except the government money market portoflio may write covered call options and purchase and sell stock index futures contracts to hedge against declines in market value of their portfolio securities the use of these instruments involves certain risks as the writer of covered call options a portfolio receives a premium but loses any opportunity to profit from an increase in the market price of the underlying securities though the premium received may partially offset such loss although stock index futures contracts may be useful in hedging against adverse changes in the value of a portfolio�s investment securities they are derivative instruments that are subject to a number of risks during certain market conditions purchases and sales of stock index futures contracts may not completely offset a decline or rise in the value of a portfolio�s investments in the futures markets it may not always be possible to execute a buy or sell order at the desired price or to close out an open position due to market conditions limits on open positions andor daily price fluctuations changes in the market value of each portfolio�s investment securities may differ substantially from the changes anticipated by the portfolio when it established its hedged positions and unanticipated price movements in a futures contract may result in a loss substantially greater than the portfolio�s initial investment in such a contract successful use of futures contracts depends upon the adviser�s ability to correctly predict movements in the securities markets generally or of a particular segment of a securities market no assurance can be given that the adviser�s judgment in this respect will be correct the cftc and the various exchanges have established limits referred to as �speculative position limits� on the maximum net long or net short position that any person may hold or control in a particular futures contract trading limits are imposed on the number of contracts that any person may trade on a particular trading day an exchange may order the liquidation of positions found to be in violation of these limits and it may impose sanctions or restrictions these trading and positions limits will not have an adverse impact on a portfolio�s strategies for hedging its securities distressed investments each portfolio other than the kinetics government money market portfolio may invest up to  of its assets in securities of companies that are in financial distress ie involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings these securities may include among other things senior or subordinated fixed income securities common stock preferred stock warrants and other kinds of indebtedness there can be no assurance that the adviser will correctly evaluate all the factors that could affect the outcome of an investment in these types of securities financially distressed securities involve considerable risk that can result in substantial or even total loss on a portfolio�s investment it is often difficult to obtain information as to the true condition of financially distressed securities these securities are often subject to litigation among the participants in the proceedings for bankruptcy or reorganization such investments may also be adversely affected by federal and state laws relating to among other things fraudulent transfers and other voidable transfers or payments lender liability and a bankruptcy court�s power to disallow reduce subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims these and other factors contribute to aboveaverage price volatility and abrupt and erratic movements of the market prices of these securities in addition the spread between the bid and asked prices of such securities may be greater than normally expected and it may take a number of years for the market price of such securities to reflect their intrinsic value � � � � � securities of financially troubled companies require active monitoring and may at times require participation in bankruptcy

behalf of the portfolios of negotiated brokerage commissions such commissions vary among different brokers a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction transactions in foreign investments often involve the payment of fixed brokerage commissions which may be higher than those in the united states there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded in the overthecounter markets but the price paid by the adviser usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup in underwritten offerings the price paid by the adviser on behalf of the portfolios includes a disclosed fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer us government securities generally are traded in the overthecounter market through brokerdealers a brokerdealer is a securities firm or bank that makes a market for securities by offering to buy at one price and sell at a slightly higher price the difference between the prices is known as a spread in placing orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the portfolios the adviser seeks to obtain the best price and execution taking into account such factors as price size of order difficulty and risk of execution and operational facilities of the firm involved for securities traded in the overthecounter markets the adviser deals directly with the dealers who make markets in these securities unless better prices and execution are available elsewhere the adviser negotiates commission rates with brokers based on the quality and quantity of services provided in light of generally prevailing rates and while the adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive commission rates the portfolios do not necessarily pay the lowest commissions available the board of trustees periodically reviews the commission rates and allocation of orders when consistent with the objectives of best price and execution business may be placed with brokerdealers who furnish investment research or services to the adviser such research or services include advice both orally and in writing as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities as well as analyses and reports concerning issues industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts to the extent portfolio transactions are effected with brokerdealers who furnish research services to the adviser the adviser receives a benefit not capable of evaluation in dollar amounts without providing any direct monetary benefit to the portfolios from these transactions the adviser believes that most research services obtained by it generally benefit several or all of the investment companies and private accounts which it manages as opposed to solely benefiting one specific managed fund or account the trust on behalf of a portfolio may also enter into arrangements commonly referred to as �brokerservice arrangements� with brokerdealers pursuant to which a brokerdealer agrees to pay the cost of certain products or services provided to the portfolio in exchange for fund brokerage under a typical brokerageservice arrangement a broker agrees to pay a portion of the portfolio�s custodian administrative or transfer agency fees and in exchange the portfolio agrees to direct a minimum amount of brokerage to the broker the adviser on behalf of the trust usually negotiates the

shortterm credit ratings a standard  poor�s shortterm issue credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation having an original maturity of no more than  days the following summarizes the rating categories used by standard  poor�s for shortterm issues �a�  obligations are rated in the highest category and indicate that the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong within this category certain obligations are designated with a plus sign  this indicates that the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong �a�  obligations are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories however the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory �a�  obligations exhibit adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation �b�  obligations have significant speculative characteristics the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation however it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the obligor�s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation �c�  obligations are currently vulnerable to nonpayment and are dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation �d�  obligations are in payment default the �d� rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poor�s believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the �d� rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized local currency and foreign currency risks  country risk considerations are a standard part of standard  poor�s analysis for credit ratings on any issuer or issue currency of repayment is a key factor in this analysis an obligor�s capacity to repay foreign currency obligations may be lower than its capacity to repay obligations in its local currency due to the sovereign government�s own relatively lower capacity to repay external versus domestic debt these sovereign risk considerations are incorporated in the debt ratings assigned to specific issues foreign currency issuer ratings are also distinguished from local currency issuer ratings to identify those instances where sovereign risks make them different for the same issuer moody�s shortterm ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor shortterm financial obligations these obligations have an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months unless explicitly noted the following summarizes the rating categories used by moody�s for shortterm obligations �p�  issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have a superior ability to repay shortterm debt obligations � � � � � � �p�  issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have a strong ability to repay shortterm debt obligations �p�  issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have an acceptable ability to repay shortterm debt obligations �np�  issuers or supporting institutions rated not prime do not fall within any of the prime rating categories fitch ratings inc �fitch� shortterm ratings apply to time horizons of less than  months for most obligations or up to three years for us public finance securities and thus place greater emphasis on the liquidity necessary to meet financial commitments in a timely manner the following summarizes the rating categories used by fitch for shortterm obligations �f�  securities possess the highest credit quality this designation indicates the strongest capacity for timely payment of financial commitments and may have an added �� to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature �f�  securities possess good credit quality this designation indicates a satisfactory capacity for timely payment of financial commitments but the margin of safety is not as great as in the case of the higher ratings �f�  securities possess fair credit quality this designation indicates that the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate however nearterm adverse changes could result in a reduction to noninvestment grade �b�  securities possess speculative credit quality this designation indicates minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments plus vulnerability to nearterm adverse changes in financial and economic conditions �c�  securities possess high default risk default is a real possibility this designation indicates a capacity for meeting financial commitments which is solely reliant upon a sustained favorable business and economic environment �d�  securities are in actual or imminent payment default the following summarizes the ratings used by dominion bond rating service limited �dbrs� for commercial paper and shortterm debt �r high���shortterm debt rated �r high� is of the highest credit quality and indicates an entity possessing an unquestioned ability to repay current liabilities as they fall due entities rated in this category normally maintain strong liquidity positions conservative debt levels and profitability that is both stable and above average companies achieving an �r high� rating are normally leaders in structurally sound industry segments with proven track records sustainable positive future results and no substantial qualifying negative factors given the extremely tough definition which dbrs has established for an �r high� few entities are strong enough to achieve this rating �r middle�  shortterm debt rated �r middle� is of superior credit quality and in most cases ratings in this category differ from �r high� credits by only a small degree given the extremely tough definition which dbrs has established for the �r high� category entities rated �r middle� are also considered strong credits which typically exemplify above average strength in key areas of consideration for timely repayment of shortterm liabilities �r low�  shortterm debt rated �r low� is of satisfactory credit quality the overall strength and outlook for key liquidity debt and profitability ratios are not normally as favorable as with higher rating categories but these considerations are still respectable any qualifying negative factors which exist are considered manageable and the entity is normally of sufficient size to have some influence in its industry � � � � � � �r high�  shortterm debt rated r high is considered to be at the upper end of adequate credit quality the ability to repay obligations as they mature remains acceptable although the overall strength and outlook for key liquidity debt and profitability ratios are not as strong as credits rated in the r low category relative to the latter category other shortcomings often include areas such as stability financial flexibility and the relative size and market position of the entity within its industry �r middle  shortterm debt rated r middle is considered to be of adequate credit quality relative to the r high category entities rated r middle typically have some combination of higher volatility weaker debt or liquidity positions lower future cash flow capabilities or hold a weaker industry position ratings in this category would also be more vulnerable to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions �r low�  shortterm debt rated r low is considered to be of only just adequate credit quality one step up from being speculative while not yet defined as speculative the r low category signifies that although repayment is still expected the certainty of repayment could be impacted by a variety of possible adverse developments many of which would be outside of the issuer�s control entities in this area often have limited access to capital markets and may also have limitations in securing alternative sources of liquidity particularly during periods of weak economic conditions �r high� �r middle� �r low�  shortterm debt rated �r� is speculative and within the three subset grades the capacity for timely payment ranges from mildly speculative to doubtful �r� credits tend to have weak liquidity and debt ratios and the future trend of these ratios is also unclear due to its speculative nature companies with �r� ratings would normally have very limited access to alternative sources of liquidity earnings and cash flow would typically be very unstable and the level of overall profitability of the entity is also likely to be low the industry environment may be weak and strong negative qualifying factors are also likely to be present �d�  shortterm debt rated �d� is in arrears a security rated d implies the issuer has either not met a scheduled payment or the issuer has made it clear that it will be missing such a payment in the near future in some cases dbrs may not assign a d rating under a bankruptcy announcement scenario as allowances for grace periods may exist in the underlying legal documentation once assigned the d rating will continue as long as the missed payment continues to be in arrears and until such time as the rating is suspended discontinued or reinstated by dbrs longterm credit ratings the following summarizes the ratings used by standard  poor�s for longterm issues �aaa�  an obligation rated �aaa� has the highest rating assigned by standard  poor�s the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong �aa�  an obligation rated �aa� differs from the highest rated obligations only in small degree the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong �a�  an obligation rated �a� is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong �bbb�  an obligation rated �bbb� exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation � � � � � � obligations rated �bb� �b� �ccc� �cc� and �c� are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics �bb� indicates the least degree of speculation and �c� the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions �bb�  an obligation rated �bb� is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor�s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation �b�  an obligation rated �b� is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated �bb� but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor�s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation �ccc�  an obligation rated �ccc� is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation �cc�  an obligation rated �cc� is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment �c�  the �c� rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action has been taken but payments on this obligation are being continued �d�  an obligation rated �d� is in payment default the �d� rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poor�s believes that such payment will be made during such grace period the �d� rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized �r�  the symbol �r� is attached to the ratings of instruments with significant noncredit risks it highlights risks to principal or volatility of expected returns which are not addressed in the credit rating �nr�  an �nr� attached to an obligation indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poor�s does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy  plus  or minus   the ratings from �aa� through �ccc� may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories the following summarizes the ratings used by moody�s for longterm debt �aaa�  obligations rated �aaa� are judged to be of the highest quality with minimal credit risk �aa�  obligations rated �aa� are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk �a�  obligations rated �a� are considered uppermedium grade and are subject to low credit risk �baa�  obligations rated �baa� are subject to moderate credit risk they are considered mediumgrade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics � � � � � � �ba�  obligations rated �ba� are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk �b�  obligations rated �b� are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk �caa�  obligations rated �caa� are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk �ca�  obligations rated �ca� are highly speculative and are likely in or very near default with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest �c�  obligations rated �c� are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in default with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest note moody�s applies numerical modifiers   and  in each generic rating classification from �aa� through �caa� the modifier  indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category the following summarizes longterm ratings used by fitch �aaa�  securities considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality these ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk and are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments this capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events �aa�  securities considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality these ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk and indicate very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments this capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events �a�  securities considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality these ratings denote a low expectation of credit risk the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered strong this capacity may nevertheless be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings �bbb�  securities considered to be investment grade and of good credit quality these ratings denote that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity this is the lowest investmentgrade category �bb�  securities considered to be speculative these ratings indicate that there is a possibility of credit risk developing particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time however business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met securities rated in this category are not investment grade �b�  securities considered to be highly speculative these ratings indicate that significant credit risk is present but a limited margin of safety remains financial commitments are currently being met however capacity for continued payment is contingent upon a sustained favorable business and economic environment �ccc� �cc� and �c�  securities have high default risk default is a real possibility and capacity for meeting financial commitments is solely reliant upon sustained favorable business or economic developments �cc� ratings indicate that default of some kind appears probable and �c� ratings signal imminent default � � � � � � �ddd� �dd� and �d�  securities are in default the ratings of obligations in these categories are based on their prospects for achieving partial or full recovery in a reorganization or liquidation of the obligor entities rated in this category have defaulted on some or all of their obligations entities rated �ddd� have the highest prospect for resumption of performance or continued operation with or without a formal reorganization process entities rated �dd� and �d� are generally undergoing a formal reorganization or liquidation process those rated �dd� are likely to satisfy a higher portion of their outstanding obligations while entities rated �d� have a poor prospect of repaying all obligations plus  or minus  may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories such suffixes are not added to the �aaa� category or to categories below �ccc� the following summarizes the ratings used by dbrs for longterm debt �aaa�  �bonds rated �aaa� are of the highest credit quality with exceptionally strong protection for the timely repayment of principal and interest earnings are considered stable the structure of the industry in which the entity operates is strong and the outlook for future profitability is favorable there are few qualifying factors present which would detract from the performance of the entity the strength of liquidity and coverage ratios is unquestioned and the entity has established a creditable track record of superior performance given the extremely high standard which dbrs has set for this category few entities are able to achieve a �aaa� rating �aa�  bonds rated �aa� are of superior credit quality�and protection of interest and principal is considered high in many cases they differ from bonds rated �aaa� only to a small degree given the extremely restrictive definition which dbrs has for the �aaa� category entities rated �aa� are also considered to be strong credits which typically exemplify aboveaverage strength in key areas of consideration and are unlikely to be significantly affected by reasonably foreseeable events �a�  bonds rated �a� are of satisfactory credit quality protection of interest and principal is still substantial but the degree of strength is less than with �aa�rated entities while �a� is a respectable rating entities in this category are considered to be more susceptible to adverse economic conditions and have greater cyclical tendencies than higherrated securities �bbb�  bonds rated �bbb� are of adequate credit quality protection of interest and principal is considered acceptable but the entity is fairly susceptible to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions or there may be other adverse conditions present which reduce the strength of the entity and its rated securities �bb�  bonds rated �bb� are defined to be speculative and non investmentgrade�where the degree of protection afforded interest and principal is uncertain particularly during periods of economic recession entities in the �bb� range typically have limited access to capital markets and additional liquidity support in many cases deficiencies in critical mass diversification and competitive strength are additional negative considerations �b�  bonds rated �b� are highly speculative�and there is a reasonably high level of uncertainty as to the ability of the entity to pay interest and principal on a continuing basis in the future especially in periods of economic recession or industry adversity �ccc�  �cc�  �c�  bonds rated in any of these categories are very highly speculative�and are in danger of default of interest and principal the degree of adverse elements present is more severe than longterm bonds rated �b� longterm bonds rated below �b� often have characteristics which if not remedied may lead to default in practice there is little difference between the �ccc� to �c� categories with �cc� and �c� normally used for lower ranking debt of companies where the senior debt is rated in the �ccc� to �b� range � � � � � � �d�  longterm debt rated �d� is in arrears a security rated �d� implies the issuer has either not met a scheduled payment of interest or principal or that the issuer has made it clear that it will miss such a payment in the near future in some cases dbrs may not assign a �d� rating under a bankruptcy announcement scenario as allowances for grace periods may exist in the underlying legal documentation once assigned the �d� rating will continue as long as the missed payment continues to be in arrears and until such time as the rating is suspended discontinued or reinstated by dbrs �high� �low�  each rating category is denoted by the subcategories �high� and �low� the absence of either a �high� or �low� designation indicates the rating is in the �middle� of the category the �aaa� and �d� categories do not utilize �high� �middle� and �low� as differential grades notes to shortterm and longterm credit ratings standard  poor�s creditwatch creditwatch highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under special surveillance by standard  poor�s analytical staff these may include mergers recapitalizations voter referendums regulatory action or anticipated operating developments ratings appear on creditwatch when such an event or a deviation from an expected trend occurs and additional information is necessary to evaluate the current rating a listing however does not mean a rating change is inevitable and whenever possible a range of alternative ratings will be shown creditwatch is not intended to include all ratings under review and rating changes may occur without the ratings having first appeared on creditwatch the �positive� designation means that a rating may be raised �negative� means a rating may be lowered and �developing� means that a rating may be raised lowered or affirmed rating outlook a standard  poor�s rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a longterm credit rating over the intermediate to longer term in determining a rating outlook consideration is given to any changes in the economic andor fundamental business conditions an outlook is not necessarily a precursor of a rating change or future creditwatch action i� ���positive� means that a rating may be raised i� ���negative� means that a rating may be lowered i� ���stable� means that a rating is not likely to change i� ���developing� means a rating may be raised or lowered i� ���nm� means not meaningful moody�s watchlist moody�s uses the watchlist to indicate that a rating is under review for possible change in the shortterm a rating can be placed on review for possible upgrade upg on review for possible downgrade dng or more rarely with direction uncertain unc a credit is removed from the watchlist when the rating is upgraded downgraded or confirmed rating outlooks a moody�s rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of a rating over the medium term where assigned rating outlooks fall into the following four categories positive pos negative neg stable sta and developing dev  contingent upon an event in the few instances where an issuer has multiple outlooks of differing directions an �m� modifier indicating multiple differing outlooks will be displayed and moody�s written research will describe any differences and provide the rationale for these differences a rur ratings under review designation indicates that the issuer has one or more ratings under review for possible change and thus overrides the outlook designation when an outlook has not been assigned to an eligible entity noo no outlook may be displayed � �  � � � fitch withdrawn a rating is withdrawn when fitch deems the amount of information available to be inadequate for rating purposes or when an obligation matures is called or refinanced rating watch ratings are placed on rating watch to notify investors that there is a reasonable probability of a rating change and the likely direction of such change these are designated as �positive� indicating a potential upgrade �negative� for a potential downgrade or �evolving� if ratings may be raised lowered or maintained rating watch is typically resolved over a relatively short period rating outlook a rating outlook indicates the direction a rating is likely to move over a one to twoyear period outlooks may be positive stable or negative a positive or negative rating outlook does not imply a rating change is inevitable similarly ratings for which outlooks are �stable� could be upgraded or downgraded before an outlook moves to a positive or negative if circumstances warrant such an action occasionally fitch may be unable to identify the fundamental trend in these cases the rating outlook may be described as �evolving� dbrs rating trends each dbrs rating category is appended with one of three rating trends  �positive� �stable� or �negative� the rating trend helps to give the investor an understanding of dbrs�s opinion regarding the outlook for the rating in question however the investor must not assume that a positive or negative trend necessarily indicates that a rating change is imminent rating actions � in addition to confirming or changing ratings other dbrs rating actions include suspended ratings rating opinions are forward looking although rating opinions will consider the historical performance of an issuer a rating is an assessment of the issuer�s future ability and willingness to meet outstanding obligations as such for a complete credit quality assessment dbrs normally requires the cooperation of the issuer so that management strategies and projections may be evaluated and qualified since the availability of such information is critical to the rating assessment any reluctance in management�s willingness to supply such information either perceived or actual may cause a rating to be changed or even suspended the eventual action will depend upon dbrs�s assessment of the degree of accuracy of a rating possibly without the cooperation of management suspended ratings indicate that an issuer still has outstanding debt but dbrs no longer provides a current rating opinion on the credit quality of that outstanding debt discontinued ratings when an entity retires all or virtually all of its outstanding debt within a particular category and has no plans to reissue in the near future dbrs may discontinue its rating other less common circumstances where dbrs may also discontinue ratings include situations where the rated debt is no longer in the public market where a defeasance structure removes the credit risk of the issuer as a consideration or where the debt comes to be held by a few large institutions that do not require ongoing dbrs ratings ratings �under review�  in practice dbrs maintains continuous surveillance of the entities it rates and therefore all ratings are always under review accordingly when a significant event occurs that directly impacts the credit quality of a particular entity or group of entities dbrs will attempt to provide an immediate rating opinion however if there is high uncertainty regarding the outcome of the event and dbrs is unable to provide an objective forwardlooking opinion in a timely manner then the ratings of the issuers will be placed �under review� since they may no longer be appropriate and can no longer be relied upon � � � � � ratings which are �under review� are qualified with one of the following three provisional statements �negative implications� �positive implications� or �developing implications� these qualifications indicate dbrs�s preliminary evaluation of the impact on the credit quality of the issuersecurity although the three provisional statements may provide some guidance to subscribers situations and potential rating implications may vary widely and dbrs�s final rating conclusion may depart from its preliminary assessment for each of these three provisional statements further due diligence has to be completed in order to determine the applicable rating in this respect and while the previous rating may no longer be appropriate and can no longer be relied upon to gauge credit quality the three provisional statements are an attempt to provide initial guidance as to possible rating outcomes after the due diligence process has been completed and dbrs has finalized its view municipal note ratings a standard  poor�s note rating reflects the liquidity factors and market access risks unique to notes due in three years or less the following summarizes the ratings used by standard  poor�s for municipal notes �sp�  the issuers of these municipal notes exhibit a strong capacity to pay principal and interest those issues determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service are given a plus  designation �sp�  the issuers of these municipal notes exhibit a satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes �sp�  the issuers of these municipal notes exhibit speculative capacity to pay principal and interest moody�s uses three rating categories for shortterm municipal obligations that are considered investment grade these ratings are designated as municipal investment grade �mig� and are divided into three levels  �mig� through �mig� in addition those shortterm obligations that are of speculative quality are designated �sg� or speculative grade mig ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation the following summarized the ratings by moody�s for these shortterm obligations �mig�  this designation denotes superior credit quality excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows highly reliable liquidity support or demonstrated broadbased access to the market for refinancing �mig�  this designation denotes strong credit quality margins of protection are ample although not as large as in the preceding group �mig�  this designation denotes acceptable credit quality liquidity and cashflow protection may be narrow and market access for refinancing is likely to be less wellestablished �sg�  this designation denotes speculativegrade credit quality debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins of protection in the case of variable rate demand obligations �vrdos� a twocomponent rating is assigned a long or shortterm debt rating and a demand obligation rating the first element represents moody�s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with scheduled principal and interest payments the second element represents moody�s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with the ability to receive purchase price upon demand �demand feature� using a variation of the mig rating scale the variable municipal investment grade or �vmig� rating � � � � � when either the long or shortterm aspect of a vrdo is not rated that piece is designated �nr� eg �aaanr� or �nrvmig� vmig rating expirations are a function of each issue�s specific structural or credit features �vmig�  this designation denotes superior credit quality excellent protection is afforded by the superior shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand �vmig�  this designation denotes strong credit quality good protection is afforded by the strong shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand �vmig�  this designation

overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high high this funds expenses are rated as high because they are above the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

feeload   see fund picks from fidelity� for no transaction fee alternatives summary overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk
