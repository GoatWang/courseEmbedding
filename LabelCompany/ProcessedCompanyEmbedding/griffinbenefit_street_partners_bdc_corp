conditions griffinbenefit street partners bdc corp a publicly registered nontraded business development company is actively exploring strategic options for the company citing a changing regulatory environment structural challenges as well as market and yield dynamics associated with operating a nontraded bdc griffinbenefit street partners’ board of directors voted to cease the current offering effective march   griffin capital will work with the board to explore strategic options for the bdc that are “in keeping with the best interests of the shareholders” in that regard griffin capital is working to expand the griffin institutional access family of investment products to build upon the success of griffin institutional access real estate fund girex among other initiatives griffin intends to develop a global credit oriented interval fund that will complement and expand upon the investment mandate of the bdc during an exclusive interview with the di wire griffin capital ceo kevin shields explained the upside of possibly merging the company into an interval fund structure upon shareholder approval “the nontraded bdc market is coming under increasing regulatory pressure between finra ntm  the proposed dol fiduciary rule and nasaa’s asset concentration limitation – the confluence of which will deteriorate industry bdc sales the bdc structure is limited in its investment mandate and given most all nontraded bdcs invest at the top end of the capital stack it is difficult to overcome the high front end load by contrast the interval fund structure allows for a broad pallet of investment alternatives has lower upfront fees lower ongoing fees and given our exemptive relief can offer multiple share classes to fit the needs of the advisors and their clients further the interval fund is not hampered by the regulatory headwind facing the nontraded bdc space” he added “whereas making this type of structural shift midoffering is difficult to accomplish and may cause shortterm market confusion we are firm in our resolve that the lower fee proposition of the interval fund coupled with the increased breadth of debt alternatives in which the fund can invest will drive enhanced shareholder returns and improve their overall experience in the end this is about doing the right thing for our investors” the motivation for the bdc’s strategic structural shift includes a number of factors according to shields nontraded bdc sponsors focus on originating andor acquiring senior secured and senior debt of private corporations or public corporations with a market equity capitalization of less than  million – this narrow bandwidth restricts efficient capital deployment and allocation in a fluid and dynamic credit market high offering fees particularly for a debt platform have to compress to enhance an investor’s positive economic experience a positive investor outcome is further challenged given the propensity of the public bdc market to trade at a discount to net asset value which recently exceeded  percent a nontraded bdc illiquidity premium is illogical to the extent an investor can acquire in the current market environment a liquid traded bdc with a demonstrably higher current return shields indicated that “in griffin capital’s opinion the interval fund structure offers a number of potential advantages to investors over the business development company structure including” greater net asset value transparency with daily pricing frequency enhanced liquidity  interval funds are required to offer shareholders periodic redemptions of at least  percent of the fund’s outstanding shares typically on a quarterly basis wider range of investment opportunities – bdcs unlike interval funds must have at least  percent of their assets invested in specific types of issuers lower fees – unlike bdcs interval funds generally are prohibited from charging investors an incentive fee shields continued “benefit street partners is an important relationship to us and their involvement is critical to achieve ongoing success we could not be more pleased that we have the full support of benefit street to engage in this strategic shift further we look forward to sharing information with the market in the near term regarding both our plans for the bdc and our exciting product development initiatives” griffin capital bdc advisor is an
