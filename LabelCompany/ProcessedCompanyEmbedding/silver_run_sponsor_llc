billion april 7 7 less than one month ago investors bet  billion on james hackett former president and ceo of anadarko petroleum corp  silver run acquisition corp ii is a blank check company that will leverage james hackett’s knowledge of the eagle ford shale and permian basin to fund an opportunistic acquisition  silver run ii was created by the riverstone holdings llc the bank that successfully started the blank check company over a year ago now known as centennial resource production llc the original stock sale for silver run acquisition corp i which raised 9 million is expected to exceed  billion  if the banks managing the deal exercise their options to buy shares which they generally do the company would be tied for the record largest blankcheck offering  before we review the recent uptick in investment in oil and gas blank check companies we will review the basics of blank check companies and special purpose acquisition companies spacs what is a blank check company a blank check company as defined by the sec is a “development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies other entity or person”  because the acquisition opportunity has yet to be identified investors do not know how their funds will be spent so they write a blank check to the company  one kind of blank check company is a special purpose acquisition company spac what is a spac alice hsu partner at akin gump strauss hauer  feld llp explained “spacs are newly formed shell companies without any revenue or operating history that raise proceeds in an ipo” in order to finance a merger or acquisition in a specific timeframe  the money raised goes into a separate trust that can only be used for an eventual merger or acquisition  at least  of the assets held in the trust account must be used to fund the acquisition of the target business or businesses  if a spac does not meet certain goals within a specified time frame generally  to  months then the company will liquidate and return the prorata share of funds to investors spacs raise capital through ipos in which one unit and its attached warrant is typically priced at  making them “penny stocks”  a short period after the ipo the common stock and the warrants comprising one unit will begin separate trading at which point holders have the option to continue to hold their units or separate them  spacs are usually sponsored by an industry guru whose experience and knowledge of the industry gives them a unique position in to pursue acquisitions   in 7 there were  spacs that completed ipos  but until  oil and gas spacs were uncommon oil and gas spacs since the crash in oil prices in  many oil and gas companies found themselves in dire need of capital  many distressed companies sold off noncore assets for heavy discounts in order to quickly generate cash to pay off debt and avoid bankruptcy this gave investors a unique opportunity to pick up assets at low prices and spac’s provide a source of private capital to do this the first oil and gas spac avondale acquisition aacou founded in april  never completed an ipo as its original sponsor former ceo of chesapeake energy  founder of american energy partners lp aubrey mcclendon died in a car crash in march   the company formally withdrew its plans for an ipo to raise  million in november  in early two oil and gas special purpose acquisition companies spacs successfully completed ipos  this included ’s largest us ipo as of february   silver run acquisition corp  corrie driebusch and ryan dezember of the wsj said the size of the deal in “an otherwise frozen market for initial public offering” … “reaffirms investors’ appetite for bottomfeeding in the oil and gas business”  the timing the deal shows that investors believed in early  that the oil and gas market had bottomed out and would rebound within the next two years when its term to make a deal would expire where are oil and gas spacs investing silver run acquisition corp sraqu was sponsored by mark papa former ceo of eog resources  silver run acquisition corp raised  million when it began trading on the nasdaq  in july  silver run acquired a controlling interest in centennial resource production llc an independent natural gas company located in the core of the delaware basin  centennial has acreage in reeves ward and pecos counties  the transaction was financed by riverstone holdings llc an energy investment banking firm  after the transaction silver run was renamed centennial resource development corp cdev klr energy acquisition corp klre raised approximately  million in its ipo  it is sponsored by gary hanna former ceo of epl oil and gas inc  the company announced a meeting date for stockholders to vote on the business combination with tema oil and gas company  the meeting is scheduled for april  7  tema oil and gas company is a privately held company operating in texas and new mexico and holds acreage in the core of the deleware basin in loving county  after the closing of the transaction the company will change its name to rosehill resources inc and will trade on the nasdaq under the tickers rose roseu and rosew kayne anderson acquisition corp started by a los angeles private equity firm which focuses on pipelines raised  million in an ipo on march  7   this spac is different than most others in the oil and gas space as they do not have one industry guru as a sponsor but rather are sponsored by kayne anderson sponsor llc which is most likely run by a team of investors at kayne anderson capital advisors llc after listing on the nasdaq just last week vantage energy acquisition corp veacu a blank check special purpose acquisition company raised  million  vantage energy acquisition corp is sponsored by roger biemans who was the ceo of vantage energy until it sold to rice energy last october  it is likely that vantage energy will pursue investment opportunities in the marcellus shale as roger bieman’s former experience was centered there additionally it is rumored that occidental petroleum is in the talks to launch a spac sponsored by former ceo stephen chazen conclusion while the majority of ma has been focused in the permian basin over the last year the varying investments of oil and gas spacs demonstrate that the knowledge of the industry experts is what investors find valuable  investment by spacs has been higher of course in the delaware basin but some of the spacs are focusing on natural gas in the marcellus and utica as well the continuation of investment in oil and gas spacs shows that investors still believe that there are opportunities to find bargain investments in the oil and gas space throughout many basins  the emergence of oil and gas spacs however is still recent and there is little history to understand the success of such companies mercer capital has
