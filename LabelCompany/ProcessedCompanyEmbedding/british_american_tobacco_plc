pricelinkedin accountsummarystrong product lineup and brands coupled with upcoming merger should continue to fuel bats successfavorable positioning in alternative cigarette products such as vaporizers and heatnotburna switch to quarterly dividend payments next year should generate even more interest amongst income investorsstock is fully valued wait for a more attractive entry point while its no secret that the tobacco industry has historically been a gold mine for investors one company seems to continuously fly underneath the radar british american tobacco nysemktbti despite impressive performance those within the sa community have shown little interest in the global behemoth while its counterpart philip morris international nysepm garners most of the attention bat has arguably more attractive fundamentals and catalysts to propel it to future growth during fullyear  cigarette volumes at bat increased  even with a volatile british pound constant revenue and profit rates were up  and  respectively comparatively philip morris reported less impressive results across the board cigarette volumes declined  while constant revenue declined  and profit increased  despite both companies having faced significant currency fluctuations british american tobacco had an outstanding  as reflected by volume bat is showing organic growth in an industry where it is hard to come by their four major brands pall mall kent lucky strike and dunhill are gaining popularity as consumers in emerging markets transition into higher end tobacco products despite the numbers though philip morris continues to garner a significantly higher valuation this is a result of two major factors more excitement for philip morris future products and their steadier dividend bonnie herzog a wells fargo analyst recently released a research note in which she stated that philip morris next generation iqos smoking platforms have the potential to add an additional  to pms current stock price as you can see below so far this year both stocks have absolutely crushed the broader indices with philip morris up about  over bat much of that difference can be attributed to the dollar having weakened  year to date a weak dollar is good news for philip morris international as all of its revenues are earned in foreign currencies the merger after plenty of speculation earlier this year it was announced that reynolds american nyserai had agreed for bat to purchase the existing  of the company it didnt already own this is tremendous for bat as it will instantly gain a large foothold in one of the most profitable markets in the industry outside of china the united states is currently the most attractive cigarette and tobacco market despite a long decline in usage high purchasing power has more than offset taxes and litigation roughly two packs of cigarettes sold in america generates the same amount of revenue as the equivalent to thirteen packs sold in emergingunderdeveloped markets once the merger is completed bat will become the largest tobacco company on earth as well as the only one with a global reach that extends into the united states since its spinoff in  from altria nysemo philip morris international no longer generates any revenue in america although the deal is still pending shareholder approval with bat already owning  of existing rai shares the merger will assuredly be approved later this year next generation products in addition to market share bat will also gain access to reynolds next generation products and technology while bat already has a very promising group of noncigarette products such as the vype pebble reynolds has been at the forefront of technological innovation they themselves have an industry leading vaporizing product called vuse roughly  of all electronic smoking devices sold in america are manufactured by reynolds american once combined bat will have the largest vapor business worldwide in north america over the next five years the vape industry is projected to grow at a whopping cagr of roughly  by far the most interesting products in the industry however are those in the heatnotburn category staying true to the name these handheld devices heat sticks of tobacco taking the combustible factor out of the equation this results in a unique experience that provides the nicotine kick found in cigarettes without many of the negatives such as the release of harmful toxins and smell while philip morris and their iqos heatnotburn have been capturing headlines bats own heatnotburn product glo has also been doing extremely well using sendai japan as its initial testing ground response from customers was so great that some waited overnight outside of convenience stores to purchase one with plans to roll glo out to the rest of japan by the end of the year early results have been incredibly promising as of last tally one in five smokers in sendai has already purchased a glo since december market saturation however may become an issue as japan tobacco otcpkjapay plans on releasing their own heatnotburn product ploom tech in the coming months even despite the positive reception of these products at this point their future is still somewhat uncertain while smokers have generally been positive on iqos and glo it remains to be seen just how much healthier they actually are claims from big tobacco are to be taken with a grain of salt at this point a recent article from the daily mail revealed that heatnotburn products may not be as revolutionary as some may think last week the fda began its study on the iqos to conclude if claims from philip morris are indeed accurate if they are proven to be true look for next generation smoking products to significantly expand in popularity results are expected to be released in about a year itc ltd another exciting development within bat is their   billion dollar stake in itc ltd formerly known as the indian tobacco company itc is a conglomerate and one of the largest public companies in india in addition to tobacco itc offers a wide array of goods and services within india including packaged food and personal care products arguably the most compelling emerging market at the moment india has a population that is expected to reach  billion by  due to government regulation its unlikely bat will ever be able to fully acquire itc however the current stake that they own gives them a nice foothold in a difficult to access market earlier this year philip morris was blindsided when indian courts ruled that they were planning on tightening regulations on foreign investment in their tobacco industry philip morris has since threatened significant changes even suggesting that they may pull out of the region all together if the new protectionist rules are implemented itc which already controls  of the indian tobacco market could have an even larger stranglehold if philip morris decides to leave the dividend a major reason why american investors have shied away from british american tobacco in lieu of philip morris is in part because of their unsteady dividend distributions being a foreign adr the company distributes a dividend semiannually as opposed to the american standard of quarterly this has turned off income investors looking for a stable source of income depending on the exchange rate between the gbp and usd later this year when the second dividend is distributed bats dividend yield is likely to be roughly around  the lowest its been in years also lower than both altrias and philip morris if you look at bats recent dividend distributions dating back to  youll find an inconsistent and generally decliningstagnant dividend this however is a direct result of the weakening british pound versus the us dollar looking at bats distributions via their london based shares tells a different story over the past  years bat has actually grown their dividend by  yy unfortunately for us american investors though the recent stagnationdecline in bats american dividend distributions has perfectly coincided with the decline of the british pound starting in  the good news is that british american tobacco announced earlier this year that they will begin distributing dividends quarterly beginning in  this move will allow investors to receive a steadier stream of income for their portfolios if the british pound continues to weaken versus the dollar however it may be a while before we begin to see any significant dividend growth conclusion as governments across the world continue to crackdown on traditional cigarette usage bat is incredibly well positioned to weather the effects even as litigation costs begin to rise in the alternative product categories this is actually considered a positive for bat in fact rising litigation expenses are viewed as a positive for big tobacco because they are the only companies with enough resources to accommodate the costs associated with regulation regardless of how things shake out politically in the uk british american tobacco will be amongst one of the best companies to ride out the wave of uncertainty so long as yields remain low look for tobacco stocks to
