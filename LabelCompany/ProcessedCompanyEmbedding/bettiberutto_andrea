jul  7 technologiesdigital semiconductors interview andrea bettiberutto cto gigoptix andrea bettiberutto chief technology officer gigoptix on the hottest applications in millimeterwave technologies and more nancy friedrich  aug   nf can you tell us a little about gigoptix its roots and how and why it became a company ab gigoptix was founded in  with the acquisition of the assets of iterra communication of which i was one of the founders since  iterra had developed highspeed technology in gaas and inp devices and packaged multichip solutions for broadband rf and fiberoptic applications addressing markets such as highperformance telecommunications instrumentation and military systems in  i met avi katz who is now gigoptix’s ceo together we started a thorough review of iterra technology of the overall market situation and of potential directions for growth it became clear that the fiberoptic market was emerging from a slow period of the previous five years and that  and gbs applications would offer opportunities we saw that there was no semiconductor vendor truly serving fiberoptic markets as a “onestop shop” from short links such as datacenter interconnections to long hauls such as submarine links to serve those growing markets we saw that besides growing iterra’s business in gaas and inp technology it would also be necessary to expand into other engineering skills and technologies—such as mixedsignal sige bicmos and highspeed silicon cmos we proposed a detailed plan to our investor dbsi which consisted of converting all assets of iterra into a new entity called gigoptix which would be highly focused on fiberoptic interconnections we also created a product roadmap for both organic internal expansion and inorganic via acquisition growth we executed this plan in the past five years with the following acquisitions helix switzerland with products and expertise in mixedsignal sige bicmos for shortreach optical links such as in datacommunications centers lumera bothell wa with highspeed compact lowpower polymerbased optical modulator technology for data communications and telecommunications applications which we now offer to customers bundled with our chipx integratedcircuit ic drivers and which allowed us to move in complex cmos integration for future fiberopticinterconnect opportunities and endwave with millimeterwave technology for pointtopoint applications which we consider quite complementary to our fiberoptic product lines gigoptix management under avi katz has integrated these companies and technologies in an efficient and synergistic way with a high level of focus to maintain our planned strategy for organic growth nf by designing the ics that link the optical and electronic domains gigoptix occupies an interesting area—at the intersection between millimeterwave and fiberoptic technologies how do you branch both areas it is an interesting area and requires a great deal of expertise to understand how to bring the different technologies together and to benefit from each other we have created a strong internal technical environment of engineers with solid ic and packaging experience spanning broadband amplifiers at low frequencies through  ghz mixedsignal architectures and various optical interfaces and devices we encourage internal technical exchanges and crosstraining between teams this is why we see the eband product line as not only complementary to our fiberoptics business but also very synergistic from a technical point of view in fact the eband ic designers are part of the same engineering team involved in the fiberoptic product lines we were also able to consolidate most of the product lines under the same roof in our san jose ca headquarters facility this encourages interaction and has created a strong working relationship with our european office in zurich switzerland nf with all the exciting rd in millimeterwave technologies what are the hottest applications driving it right now ab lte will soon be ubiquitous due to the fact that the adoption rate of new technologies is getting faster and faster lte can support rates to  mbs to the user so multiply that by the number of people who’ll buy the nextgeneration android and iphone smartphones and you come up with a lot of data being transferred gigoptix’s mission is to enable highspeed data communications whether it is optically wirelessly or over copper we expect highspeed wireless infrastructure to be rolled out to address the forecasted user demand for more bandwidth and we expect eband technology to play a central role in enabling this revolution nf what technology advancements are needed to enable the next generation of millimeterwave applications ab when pointtopoint radio designers must deal with chipandwire assembly at  ghz minimizing the number of ics per transceiver is critical therefore a high level of integration must be achieved this means that advanced design techniques are needed to integrate full transceivers with both analog and digital control these may be single ics using lowcost technologies such as sige bicmos output power must be delivered in the most efficient ways possible and this can only be achieved with gaas technologies one of the challenges in designing highly efficient power amplifiers at such high frequencies is the lack of test equipment to characterize the nonlinear performance of transistors at eband frequencies such as millimeterwave active loadpull systems this void forces engineers to endure multiple design iterations and foundry runs and loss of time another important need is lowcost packaging with a lowloss eband interface nf optical networking has remained a good niche despite the fact that wireless has nabbed most of the spotlight do you expect optical technology to gain any new or bigger opportunities or will it just chug along in a supportofwirelesstype role ab this is obviously a question coming from a wirelessfocused magazine optical networking is becoming much more common than people realize and displacing both copper and wireless links over a broad range of applications optical networking is found increasingly in enterprise networks carrying gbs gbs and even gbs data in data centers disk farms etc we see optical fttx displacing digitalsubscriberline dsl and cable modems especially in green field situations such as china we see optical links being used in the backplanes of routers and large servers to carry data due to the increasing bandwidth needs soon we may even have optical pci ab we’re also seeing optical technology beginning to penetrate consumer applications—for instance the growth of television screen sizes and resolutions means that there’s now as much as  gbs of raw image data being transferred onto the screen today with threedimensional d tv hz refresh rates increasing screen sizes and color depth  gbs data transfers are not too far off and an optical link provides a lowcost lowpower emifree means of transferring the data gigoptix has the broadest range of optical solutions to address all these applications so we see great potential for growth in the market nf although gigoptix is a small company its technology allows the firm to serve many markets ranging from defense and medical to telecommunications and consumer electronics how is the company organized to allow it to be flexible and adaptable in terms of where it puts its focus and resources ab gigoptix is a fastgrowing company—generally growing by  year on year—so we are successfully juggling our priorities and resources we are successful because we focus on enabling highspeed data communication for our customers we have a very flat management structure with three product lines focused on optics rfmicrowave and applicationspecific ic asic products there is a lot of synergy between the lines especially between optics and rfmicrowave the two media appear to be converging with optics now utilizing coherent receivers multilevel signaling and highpower dsps similar to the rf world in order to cram more bits through a channel wireless communications is moving higher in frequency and closer to the optical realm to enable larger bandwidths for transferring more data given the similarities we are able to exploit similar technologies such as gaas inp and sige bicmos and design techniques to enable our product solutions nf as a fabless semiconductor company serving such different markets how varied are the process technologies that you use in manufacturing your integrated circuits ics what is the most exotic process technology that gigoptix has used ab this depends on your point of view originally i was a microwave gaas power designer and i always felt offended when somebody called gaas exotic when i started to use sige bicmos i understood why gaas could be considered exotic because gigoptix is a fabless semiconductor company we will use any ic technology that makes sense from gaas and inp phemts and hbts which might be considered exotics to sige and cmos but the most exotic technology we deal with is our proprietary thin film polymer on silicon tfps process which allows us to realize highly integrated ultrabroadband optical modulator configurations —such as dqpsk rzdqpsk and dpqpsk—on a single chip and with very low power consumption nf how much of a challenge is it to precisely communicate your design goals to the different outside foundries that you use ab we have been working with same foundry partners for several years so we cannot say we have challenges from a communications point of view that said some ic technologies require more quality control than others and this is where the experience of our inhouse technical team and a good relationship with the foundry is important successful collaboration with some of our foundry partners has led to process improvements and to better quality in our products nf how are ics evolving to better meet the needs of current and future applications ab customers want more functionality per chip with lower power consumption and high levels of reliability to meet these requirements smart ics architectures protection circuits and correct choice of technology are essential however often one technology alone cannot provide all the required performance nf has there been any feedback from our readers on the it6 delay that was featured in the april issue of our defense electronics supplement yes your article generated quite a lot of interest in our it6 thank you the device was originally designed for a demanding  gbs submarine optical telecom application where it is used to align the data and clock to create an optical rzdpsk signal the device is now finding an application in signal integrity testing where it is used to inject jitter into digital communication channels nf as was noted in that article you are dealing largely with jitter and timedomain related issues in many of your products are there any problems in translating the performance levels that you achieve with your products into meaningful parameters for an industry rfmicrowavewireless that is largely accustomed to seeing things in the frequency domain ab we have engineering expertise in both microwavemillimeterwave and fiberoptic technologies so it is not difficult to manage different requirements depending on the needs of a customer we understand well the correlation between frequencydomain and timedomain performance levels and often use details from both areas to improve our products when we deal with ics for fiber optics we are in the time domain which is what our customers understand when we are working with ics for eband pointtopoint radios we work in the frequency domain where those customers are comfortable tags defense commercial content commercial interviews  comments hide comments comment  more information about text formats text format commentsplain text
