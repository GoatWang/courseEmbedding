master fund shares owned by the feeder fund in accordance with all the conditions of rule c under the act except as described below and the distribution of that cash to the liquidating feeder fund’s shareholders legal analysis section a of the act section a of the act generally prohibits an investment company unless registered under section  of the act from offering to sell selling or delivering after sale any security or any interest in a security or otherwise engaging in any business in interstate commerce section f of the act makes section  inapplicable to a bdc therefore you state neither the feeder funds nor the master fund will be registered under section  you state that if a feeder fund does not satisfy the definition of a bdc in section a of the act unless an exclusion or exception from registration under section  is available each feeder fund might be in violation of section a you request assurance that we will not recommend enforcement action against the feeder funds under section a of the act if each feeder fund elects to be regulated as a business development company pursuant to section a of the act section a of the act section a of the act generally provides that any company that meets the definition in sections aa and b of the act may elect to be subject to regulation as a bdc under the act section a of the act generally defines a bdc to be any closedend investment company that operates for the purpose of making investments in securities described in sections a through  of the act and makes available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of those securities you state that each feeder fund will elect to be regulated as a bdc pursuant to section a of the act no feeder fund will have any direct operations other than owning master fund shares you state that the master fund intends to invest at least  of its assets in assets described in sections a through  of the act and to make available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of those securities sections a and a of the act the definition of a bdc under section a of the act states that a bdc is operated for the purpose of making investments in securities described in sections a through  of the act and makes available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of those securities those securities generally are issued by an eligible portfolio company as defined in section a of the act section a excludes from the definition of an eligible portfolio company an investment company as defined in section  of the act and any company that would be an investment company but for an exclusion under section c of the act you state that because the master fund will be an investment company as defined in section a of the act master fund shares will not be securities issued by an eligible portfolio company or securities described in paragraphs  through  of section a you state that because all or substantially all of each feeder fund’s assets will consist of master fund shares each feeder fund will i not be operated for the purpose of making direct investments in securities described in sections a through  of the act and ii will not make available significant managerial assistance with respect to issuers of those securities accordingly each feeder fund might not satisfy the definition of a bdc in section a section a of the act generally prohibits a bdc from acquiring any assets other than assets described in paragraphs  through  of the section unless at the time of acquisition at least  percent of its total assets excluding assets for sustaining its business described in paragraph  are assets described in paragraphs  through  qualifying assets you state that because all or substantially all of the assets of each feeder fund will be invested in master fund shares no feeder fund will have  of its assets invested directly in qualifying assets thus section a might prohibit a feeder fund from acquiring any assets other than assets described in paragraphs  through  of section a you request assurances that we would not recommend enforcement action against the feeder funds under sections a and a of the act if each feeder fund includes its respective indirect ownership interest in the qualifying assets of the master fund as its own investments for purposes of section a and section a of the act in support of your request you state that the master fund intends to comply with section a at all times following its commencement of operations and that the master fund expects to make available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of those securities described in sections a through  you represent that the proposed masterfeeder structure has been established for bona fide business reasons you represent that each feeder fund will be merely an entity for investing indirectly in the master fund’s assets and as such should be permitted to include its proportionate interest in the assets of the master fund for purposes of satisfying the definition of bdc in section a of the act and for purposes of determining the percentage of its total assets that are qualifying assets you state that under these circumstances allowing each feeder fund to treat its respective indirect ownership interest in portfolio companies of the master fund as its own investments and to treat the significant managerial assistance offered to those portfolio companies by the master fund as also offered by the feeder fund is consistent with the intent behind sections a and a of the act section c of the act and rule c under the act section c of the act generally made applicable to a bdc by section  of the act prohibits a bdc from purchasing its own securities except under certain limited circumstances including among others as the commission may permit by rule rule c under the act permits a registered closedend investment company to purchase its securities for cash subject to certain conditions you request assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission against the master fund under section c of the act if it repurchases master fund shares in a planned liquidation of a feeder fund in accordance with rule c under the act except as described below rule ca in relevant part provides that if the security to be purchased is junior to any class of outstanding security of the issuer representing indebtedness all securities of such class must have an asset coverage of at least  immediately after such purchase this provision parallels the provision in section aa of the act that in relevant part makes it unlawful for any registered closedend investment company to issue any class of senior security representing indebtedness unless immediately after such issuance it will have an asset coverage of at least  as a bdc the master fund is subject to section a of the act which provides in relevant part that the asset coverage requirement of section aa of the act applicable to bdcs shall be  accordingly you state that the master fund will comply with rule ca except that any of its outstanding securities representing indebtedness will have asset coverage of at least  immediately after its repurchase of the master fund shares rule ca provides that the seller of the security to the knowledge of the issuer not be an affiliated person of the issuer you state that each feeder fund will be an affiliated person of the master fund but that the proposed repurchases of master fund shares from a liquidating feeder fund do not raise the potential for abuse that this provision was designed to address in particular you note that the finite term of each feeder fund and the planned liquidation and dissolution of each feeder fund at the end of its finite term are key aspects of the proposed arrangement which will be clearly disclosed to the master fund’s and each feeder fund’s shareholders you further state that all feeder funds will liquidate and dissolve in the same planned manner and therefore you do not believe that there is a risk of overreaching in the proposed repurchases by the master fund from the liquidating feeder funds conclusion based on the facts and representations set forth in your letter we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission against a the feeder funds i under section a of the act if each elects to be regulated as a bdc pursuant to section  of the act or ii under section a of the act if for purposes of determining the composition of its assets under section a each feeder fund looks to its proportionate ownership interest in the assets of the master fund or b the master fund under section c of the act if the master fund repurchases master fund shares in a planned liquidation of a feeder fund in accordance with rule c under the act except as described above any different facts or representations might require a different conclusion this response expresses our position on enforcement action only and does not represent any legal conclusions regarding the matters discussed in your letter vanessa m meeks senior counsel  the master fund shares will not be subject to any sales load or distribution or shareholder servicing fee  feeder fund shares may be subject to a frontend sales charge andor an annual distributionshareholder servicing fee and may be sold under a multiclass arrangement pursuant to a commission exemptive order  no feeder fund will be offered that has a different sales load and distributionshareholder servicing fee structure but the same or a similar finite life as another feeder fund and the master fund will not indirectly create a multiclass structure by using the feeder funds to offer different classes of master fund shares  the term making available significant managerial assistance by a bdc is defined in section a of the act  see investment company act release no  dec   stating that the asset coverage requirements of rule ca are the same as those prescribed by section  of the act with respect to the issuance of securities and the term asset coverage as used with respect to this condition has the same meaning as defined by section h of the act  see investment company act release no  mar   stating that repurchases from affiliated persons of the issuer are not within the rule  the abuses which may flow from such repurchases and the consequent advisability of permitting them only upon the basis of applications describing the individual transactions are apparent  the division generally permits third parties to rely on noaction letters to the extent that the third party’s facts and circumstances are substantially similar to those described in the underlying request for the noaction letter  see informal guidance program for small entities investment company act release no  mar   n   in light of the very factspecific nature of your request
