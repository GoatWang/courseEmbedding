mortgagebacked securities mbs are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage loans most commonly on residential property mortgage loans are purchased from banks mortgage companies and other originators and then assembled into pools by a governmental quasigovernmental or private entity the entity then issues securities that represent claims on the principal and interest payments made by borrowers on the loans in the pool a process known as securitization most mbss are issued by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae a us government agency or the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac us governmentsponsored enterprises ginnie mae backed by the full faith and credit of the us government guarantees that investors receive timely payments fannie mae and freddie mac also provide certain guarantees and while not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government have special authority to borrow from the us treasury some private institutions such as brokerage firms banks and homebuilders also securitize mortgages known as privatelabel mortgage securities mortgagebacked securities exhibit a variety of structures the most basic types are passthrough participation certificates which entitle the holder to a prorata share of all principal and interest payments made on the pool of loan assets more complicated mbss known as collaterized mortgage obligations or mortgage derivatives may be designed to protect investors from or expose investors to various types of risk an important risk with regard to residential mortgages involves prepayments typically because homeowners refinance when interest rates fall absent protection such prepayments would return principal to investors precisely when their options for reinvesting those funds may be relatively unattractive   modified july   stay connected  twitter  facebook rss youtube  flickr

assigned pa sf cl c assigned pa sf reflects interestonly class reflects exchangeable class ratings rationale the certificates are collateralized by  fixedrate loans secured by  properties the ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the moodys stressed dscr of x is also slightly higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x moodys trust ltv ratio of  is lower than the  conduitfusion transaction average of  but higher than many pools securitized during  moodys also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity when selecting a ratings approach with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level includes cross collateralized and cross defaulted loans herfindahl index is  the transactions loan level diversity is lower than herfindahl scores found in most multiborrower transactions issued since  with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl index is  the transactions property diversity profile is lower than the indices calculated in most multiborrower transactions issued since  moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the pools weighted average property quality grade is  which is slightly better than the indices calculated in most multiborrower transactions since  this deal has a supersenior aaa class with  credit enhancement although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against pool loss the supersenior structure is credit negative for the certificate that supports the supersenior class if the support certificate were to take a loss the loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default in recognition that their lossgiven default is higher this adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across deals the transaction was structured with additional subordination at class as to mitigate the potential increased severity to class as the principal methodology used in this rating was moodys approach to rating us cmbs conduit transactions published in september  please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys analysis employs the excelbased cmbs conduit model v which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loan level proceeds derived from moodys loan level dscr and ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure property type sponsorship and diversity moodys analysis also uses the cmbs io calculator version  which references the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit estimates original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated junior aaa class would be aa aa a respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by the issuer at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified by moodys b must be construed solely as a statement of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer invitation inducement or recommendation to purchase sell or hold any securities or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with any other matter moodys does not guarantee or make any representation or warranty as to the correctness of any information rating or communication relating to the issuer moodys shall not be liable in contract tort statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer or any other third party for any loss injury or cost caused to the issuer or any other third party in whole or in part including by any negligence but excluding fraud dishonesty andor willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be excluded on the part of or any contingency beyond the control of moodys or any of its employees or agents including any losses arising from or in connection with the procurement compilation analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form moodys received and took into account one or more thirdparty assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a neutral impact on the credit rating further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument as the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of

lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings

levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  the same as at moodys last review deal performance as of the april

watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance moodys received full year  operating results for  of the pool and full or partial year  operating results for  of the

warf of their referenced classes the transaction contains a exchangeable certificates classes as b and c may be exchanged for class pez certificates the pez certificates will be entitled to receive the sum of interest and principal distributable on the classes as b and c certificates that are exchanged for such pez certificates the rating on class pez was affirmed based on the warf of its exchangeable classes moodys rating action reflects a base expected loss of  of the current balance compared to  at moodys last review moodys base expected loss plus realized losses is now  of the original pooled balance compared to  at moodys last review moodys provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion cmbs transactions on moodyscom at httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool loan concentration an increase in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls methodology underlying the rating action the principal methodology used in these ratings was approach to rating us and canadian conduitfusion cmbs published in december  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology the methodology used in rating the exchangeable class cl pez was moodys approach to rating repackaged securities published in june  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology additionally the methodology used in rating classes xa and xb was moodys approach to rating structured finance interestonly securities published in october  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology please note that on february   moodys released a request for comment in which it has requested market feedback on proposed changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interestonly io securities called moodys approach to rating structured finance interestonly securities dated october   if moodys adopts the new methodology as proposed the changes could affect the ratings of in gs mortgage securities trust commercial passthrough certificates series gc please see moodys proposes revised approach to rating structured finance interestonly io securities which is available at wwwmoodyscom for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to the methodology on moodys ratings description of models used moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  the same as at moodys last review deal performance as of the april   distribution date the transactions aggregate certificate balance has decreased by  to  million from  million at securitization the certificates are collateralized by  mortgage loans ranging in size from less than  to  of the pool with the top ten loans constituting  of the pool eight loans constituting  of the pool are on the master servicers watchlist the watchlist includes loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the cre finance council crefc monthly reporting package as part of moodys ongoing monitoring of a transaction the agency reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance moodys received full year  operating results for  of the pool and full or partial year  operating results for  of the pool moodys weighted average conduit ltv is  compared to  at moodys last review moodys conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments defeased and ctl loans and specially serviced and troubled loans moodys net cash flow ncf reflects a weighted average haircut of  to the most recently available net operating income noi moodys value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of  moodys actual and stressed conduit dscrs are x and x respectively compared to x and x at the last review moodys actual dscr is based on moodys ncf and the loans actual debt service moodys stressed dscr is based on moodys ncf and a  stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance the top three conduit loans represent  of the pool balance the largest loan is the maine mall loan  million   of the pool which represents a paripassu interest in a  million mortgage loan the loan is secured by  sf of net rentable area contained within a  square

contributed as collateral for the loan other major tenants include apple hm forever xxi and pottery barn maine mall was built in  and renovated in   and  as of september  the property was  leased down from  in december  inline occupancy was approximately  moodys ltv and stressed dscr are  and x respectively unchanged from the prior review the second largest loan is the selig portfolio loan  million   of the pool which currently represents a paripassu interest in a  million mortgage loan the loan is collateralized by seven office properties containing  sf of aggregate nra located in seattle washington two of the buildings are located in seattles central business district cbd and five are located in the lower queen anne district the buildings were constructed between  and  and have been selectively upgraded over the years as of december  the portfolio was  leased up from  a year earlier in december  additional pari passu debt that is coterminus with the current selig portfolio loan is permitted provided that among other provisions provided in the loan documents certain aggregate appraised loantovalue dscr and debt yield parameters are met moodys accounted for the potential of future pari passu debt in its analysis the third largest loan is the epicentre loan  million   of the pool which is secured by a retailoffice mixeduse property containing a fourlevel subgrade parking garage developed in  and located in the central business district cbd of charlotte north carolina the improvements total  sf of rentable area primarily comprised of retail the retail component

a year earlier in september  moodys ltv and stressed dscr are  and x respectively unchanged from the prior review regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys did not use any stress
