skyrocketed from  per share to a high of almost  per share on news that they are cooperating with baidu and are in talks with taobaothe public relations that chinanet online holdings put out last week detailing talks with baidu and taobao is not substantial enough to justify the tripling of the companies market capthis price action follows the trend of many chinese companies that have skyrocketed on news stories only to fall back to the prior levels in the coming dayschinanet online holdings gross profit on internet advertising has been cut in half when compared to the same quarter last yearbackground chinanet online holdings inc nasdaqcnet is a business to business based internet services company that caters to small and midsized businesses the company operates segments including internet advertising television advertising brand management sales channel building and bank kiosks cnets main focus is internet advertising in the past three months they have generated about  of their revenue from internet advertising and related services the most recent chinese company to explode in a matter of days on friday september th cnet closed the trading day at around  per share due to mentioning alibabas nysebaba taobao and baidu nasdaqbidu in their own press release cnet shot up to as high as  per share in the coming days according to cnets ceo george chu we are very excited about our new focus on digital advertising and our cooperation with baidu we are also in discussions with taobao of alibaba to provide microsell  which is one of our new product solutions geared towards precision marketing for clients while this announcement seems very promising for cnet there is nothing substantial behind it this announcement by cnet seems like a welltimed public relations move by the company ahead of the alibaba public offering first off there is no concrete deal with taobao that will be putting microsell  into action on their platform any time soon secondly the cooperation announced with baidu is something that we do not see as ground breaking cnet announced cooperation with baidu with no substantial metrics behind it we believe that this cooperation is possibly a reduced rate on advertising costs based on volume this type of deal is offered to any advertiser that places enough ads on a search engine this is definitely not a game breaker by any means however this could help cnet as there gross product on internet advertising has been declining this can be seen in the chart from their q taken from cnet q in the past quarter cnets revenues from internet advertisement decreased from the same quarter last year while their cost of revenues increased the net result was cnets gross profit ratio on internet advertising was cut in half with internet advertising accounting half of all revenues it is very concerning that margins are going in the wrong direction legal proceedings cnet and its subsidiaries are named as the defendant in three ongoing lawsuits the lawsuit of the most concern was filed by xuanfu liu a  shareholder in cnet this is of utmost concern as the company is trading at a multiyear high and would be a great time for mr liu to cut his ties with the company as a result he could sell many of the shares into the market this would cause a flood of shares and greatly drive down share price the basis of this lawsuit is that the ceo mr cheng abused operation and management rights with it business opportunity online an excerpt from cnets q describes the lawsuit the complaint alleges that mr cheng abused operation and management rights and that mr chengs disposition of equity interests that business opportunity online held in beijing  the equity interests without the consent of the plaintiff was an act of infringement and in violation of the articles of association of business opportunity online and chinese corporate law the complaint seeks a court order to declare the contract allegedly entered into by and between mr cheng on behalf of business opportunity online and mr yao null and void taken from cnet q risks to shorting cnet while we believe that right now is a good opportunity to short cnet it does not come without risk the largest highlight to the positive story for cnet is that they have just received an award from the china electronic commerce association ceca for the best company in chinese entrepreneurial sme business development marketing while it is unknown what the cecas metrics are for this award it is clear that an industry group has confidence in cnet however rightedge analytics does not have faith in this company at its current price level the explosion implosion case in china in the past year many chinese companies have gone through a stage where they have exploded over a few days and then imploded back to the same levels this is based on the overreaction by the market to news much of this news is overhyped by the market and possibly company pr we will show examples of a few of these cases from the prior year you on demand holdings yod yod is a china based on demand video service prior to february yod was trading in a range of about  per share yod accelerated to a high of  per share based on a plethora of news articles claiming that yod was the netflix nasdaqnflx of china the market reacted to this press without doing their own due diligence and pumped up the share price well beyond what the company was worth the article was not untrue in stating that yod is trying to build the same type of on demand video service that nflx has developed in america however it was overreacted to yod is now trading at a fair value of around  lower than before the press releases image taken from yahoo finance the nasdaqncty the  has just gone through a similar phase of what we believe will happen with cnet upon an announcement of a joint of a joint venture with qihoo  nyseqihu the spiked over  in on august   the is now trading below the levels that they were trading at before the news announcement image taken from yahoo finance sinocoking nasdaqscok sinocoking is another similar story to what we believe cnet will follow on september   scok announced a new underground coal gasification project after the announcement shares soared to intraday highs of  per share since the market has had time to evaluate this new the share price has fallen back to normal levels around  per share image taken from yahoo finance chinanet online holdings the reasons for cnets exceptional spikes have been discussed in this article prior to the news announcements by cnet it was trading around  per share cnet soared to intraday highs of around  per share like these other companies we believe that cnet will come back down to the  level as the market digests the press release image taken from yahoo finance conclusion due to the recent price action of many chinese companies recently we believe that cnet is still worth about  per share the recent press releases will not have the effect on cnet to justify the near tripling of the stock in the past four trading days we believe that this price can be attributed to a well timed press release ahead of the alibaba ipo we believe that cnet presents a great short opportunity at these price levels disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
