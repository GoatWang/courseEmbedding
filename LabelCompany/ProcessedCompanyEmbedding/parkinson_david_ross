limited space available commonly significant positive results are seen in  to  months parkinson’s treatment treatment the treatment performed at our clinics is a breakthrough medical procedure where stem cells cellular building blocks are usually administered intravenously and subcutaneously under the skin in parkinsons patients the whole procedure takes approximately one hour and has no known negative side effects following the treatment the fetal stem cells will travel throughout the body detecting damaged cells and tissue and attempts to restore them the fetal stem cells can also stimulate existing normal cells and tissues to operate at a higher level of function boosting the body’s own repair mechanisms to aid in the healing process these highly adaptive cells then remain in the body continually locating and repairing any damage they encounter safety as with any medical treatment safety should be of the highest priority the stem cells used in our treatment undergo extensive screening for possible infection and impurities utilizing tests more sophisticated than those regularly used in the united states for stem cell research and transplant our testing process ensures we use only the healthiest cells to enable the safest and most effective fetal stem cell treatment possible and unlike other types of stem cells there is no danger of the body’s rejection of fetal stem cells due to the fact they have no antigenicity cellular fingerprint this unique quality eliminates the need for drugs used to suppress the immune system which can leave a patient exposed

of america contact us search treatment available now parkinsons breakthrough cutting edge stem cell therapy painless procedure limited space available commonly significant positive results are seen in  to  months parkinson’s treatment treatment the treatment performed at our clinics is a breakthrough medical procedure where stem cells cellular building blocks are usually administered intravenously and subcutaneously under the skin in parkinsons patients the whole procedure takes approximately one hour and has no known negative side effects following the treatment the fetal stem cells will travel throughout the body detecting damaged cells and tissue and attempts to restore them the fetal stem cells can also stimulate existing normal cells and tissues to operate at a higher level of function boosting the body’s own repair mechanisms to aid in the healing process these highly adaptive cells then remain in the body continually locating and repairing any damage they encounter safety as with any medical treatment safety should be of the highest priority the stem cells used in our treatment undergo extensive screening for possible infection and impurities utilizing tests more sophisticated than those regularly used in the united states for stem cell research and transplant our testing process ensures we use only the healthiest cells to enable the safest and most effective fetal stem cell treatment possible and unlike other types of stem cells there is no danger of the body’s rejection of fetal stem cells due to the fact they have no antigenicity cellular fingerprint this unique quality eliminates the need for drugs used to suppress the immune system which can leave a patient exposed to serious infections results with over  patients treated stem cell of america

tested for  different criteria including viral bacterial and fungal infections as well as viability moreover we use pcr dna testing which is far more sophisticated and expensive than the screening tests routinely used in the united states for other stem cell treatments will my body reject the fetal stem cells no fetal stem cellsare “immune privileged” this means that you can give the cells to any patient without matching use of immunosuppressive drugs and without rejection therefore they will not cause adverse reactions in the patient such as graftversushost disease because of this special property of the cells there is no risk of rejection or adverse reaction which can leave the body vulnerable to serious diseases and infection does your stem cell treatment have any side effects our

treatment more than one time to expedite the healing process the decision is yours if you decide to repeat the treatment usually a waiting period of  months is recommended how do the fetal stem cells actually work to bring about healing fetal stem cells are the cellular building blocks of the  cell types within the body the fetal stem cells used by stem cell of america remain in an undifferentiated state and therefore are capable of becoming any tissue organ or cell type within the body fetal stem cells also release cytokines cytokines are cellderived hormonelike polypeptides that regulate cellular replication differentiation and activation cytokines can bring normal cells and tissues to a higher level of function allowing the body’s own healing mechanisms to partner with the transplanted fetal stem cells for repair and new growth how many people have been treated with my specific disease or condition in the past  decades stem cell of america has arranged for the treatment of over three thousand patients with fetal stem cells the number of patients continues to grow please contact us to get specific information on a disease or condition where are you located
