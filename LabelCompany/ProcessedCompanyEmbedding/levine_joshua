fiscal  year as well as recent corporate developments joining us todays are josh levine accurays president and chief executive officer and kevin waters accurays senior vice president and chief financial officer before we begin id like to remind you that during our call today  the call includes forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties including statements regarding our business plans and strategies as well as our outlook for fiscal  there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations including but not limited to risks associated with the adoption of cyberknife tomotherapy onrad and radixact systems commercial execution future order growth future revenue growth and macroeconomic factors outside of the companys control these and other risks are more fully described in the press release we issued after the market close this afternoon as well as in our filings with the securities and exchange commission the forwardlooking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of todays date and we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements during the questionandanswer today we request that questioners limit themselves to two questions and then requeue with any followup questions we thank everyone in advance for their cooperation with this process and with that out of the way id like to turn the call over to accurays president and chief executive officer josh levine joshua h levine thanks doug good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining on todays call following the market close today we reported second quarter financial results highlighted by strong growth for both gross orders and backlog gross orders for the quarter increased  yearoveryear to  million while our backlog grew  yearoveryear to a record  million we believe our progress is evidence that the catalysts driving order growth discussed with you over the last several quarters are beginning to take hold these catalysts include a meaningful replacement cycle for accuray products and greater recognition by both existing and new customers that our companys product portfolio offers increased versatility and functionality for customers over the next few minutes id like to provide more color on the most important of these catalysts before turning the call over to kevin for a more detailed review of our financial performance and full year outlook first as many of you know we are entering the early phase of a multiyear replacement cycle of approximately  tomotherapy and cyberknife systems that will reach their tenure in service dates within the next  months while we anticipate replacements will generally average  to  of orders on an annual basis the results in the second quarter were north of that range with the largest number of replacements occurring in the us market at the end of our first fiscal quarter we communicated we had secured commitments for several replacement orders in q that were indeed finalized in the second quarter we are optimistic about the replacement sales momentum continuing when we look at the full file of our installed base we have a mix that leans heavily towards large multibunker ph academic institutions where many have our earlier generation tomo and cyberknife systems who will therefore benefit from the significantly improved functionality versatility and reliability of our newest devices many of these institutions are led by key opinion leaders who are engaged in research and who recognize the value of improved workflow and efficiency associated with our latest generation products our view is bolstered when we look at an installed customer base that is increasingly satisfied with the performance and reliability of our systems related to this earlier in the month we announced that accuray radiation therapy systems continue to set the industry standard for customer satisfaction once again receiving md buylines highest composite overall user satisfaction rating among radiation treatment delivery systems in the us in fact most recent ratings report for calendar q showed that accuray radiation therapy products have now achieved the highest composite rating among industry peers for  of the past  quarters the md buyline survey results are consistent with the net promoter scores by imv servicetrak where accuray was rated number one in overall system performance we believe these improvements in system performance reliability and ease of use are helping to drive gross order and backlog growth additionally future order growth benefited from an improved order mix of our cyberknife system we continue to see the majority of cyberknife system orders configured with a multileaf collimator which not only increases the versatility and speed of the system but also enhances the average selling price and margin profile while its probably too early to attribute the second quarter cyberknife order strength to recent clinical data we do believe that cyberknife sbrt study for low and intermediate risk prostate patients that was presented at astro in september will enhance the strategic positioning and clinical validation of cyberknife as an effective full body radiosurgery device supporting momentum and order growth going forward additionally while the majority of our q cyberknife orders in the us were replacement cells throughout the rest of the world we saw a healthy mix of both replacements and new cyberknife customers which speaks to the expanded versatility of our latest generation cyberknife platform transitioning to radixact future orders also benefited from the early rollout of our new radixact system the next generation of our tomotherapy platform as we announced the first patient treatments had occurred in a number of our early reference site accounts  site accounts in the us and europe customer feedback regarding the performance of the new radixact system at those locations was extremely positive with regards to speed efficiency and image quality of the device customers were also pleased with the performance of our new precision treatment planning software and its adaptor ph planning and retreatment capabilities additionally in q we continued our multisystem momentum with the booking of another multisystem order for three radixact units with the prestigious hong kong sanatorium  hospital regarding onrad our new value product segment offering in china we remain on track with regards to our initial launch as we have discussed previously regarding onrad a large element of the selling process is dependent on successful participation in provincial level tender processes based on the tender process timelines we expect initial order uptake for onrad to begin late in fiscal q or early q with further order ramp continuing from there forward while we’re pleased that the halfway mark of our fiscal year to be above our internal forecast for gross orders and backlog we recognize that potential variability in terms of outcomes timing in two key areas potentially create some revenue uncertainty in the second half of this fiscal year let me touch on these two areas revenue conversion and the timing of class a license issues in china in more detail first we continue to see modestly extended revenue conversion times due to a higher mix of international distributor orders in our backlog we experienced that increasing trend in the percentage of our backlog related to distributor orders which increased  since fiscal yearend  the impact of working with independent distributors in general is that we have less direct control over the timing in converting these orders to revenue versus our direct sales process critical activity such as site planning installation planning and coordination of contractors when the distributor has primary responsibility for system installation results in less direct line of site with the end user facility and limits our ability to manage all elements of the installation process which can result in timing variability and delays the second area of potential impact is the timing uncertainty of a final announcement concerning class a radiotherapy licenses from the chinese ministry of health given the delays in this announcement over the past several quarters it’s becoming more difficult to predict when the class a license program specifics will be finalized our internal assumption supporting our second half fiscal  revenue forecast is tied to a final announcement regarding class a radiotherapy licenses coming by the end of our fiscal third quarter but given the delays we’ve seen and the uncertainty of timing going forward we believe it’s prudent to remind you of the potential impact of our second half revenue outlook related to continued delays with that said we remain very confident in the china market opportunity overall and our competitive positioning in the class a radiotherapy segment and with that i’d like to turn the call over to kevin kevin waters thank you josh and good afternoon everyone we ended the second quarter with backlog of  million up  over the prior year backlog included gross orders of  million and net orders of  million reflecting age outs of  million and one cancellation for  million age outs in the quarter were anticipated and consistent with the guidance we provided in october in addition currency negatively impacted net orders by approximately  million in the second quarter josh already highlighted the factors contributing to our strong gross order performance including replacement sales above historical averages improved mix of both new and replacement cyberknife orders and a multisystem radixact order all of these items led to significant gross order growth in the quarter and we are approximately  million above our guidance for the first half of fiscal  first half of fiscal  gross order performance translated into  yearoveryear growth in our backlog as we look out  months to  months when these systems are installed our backlog could translate in to product revenue growth rate greater than our rate of product growth in fiscal  turning now to our income statement total revenues for the second quarter were  million compared with record levels of revenue of  million in the year ago period on a sequential basis revenues were up slightly over the first quarter and we continue to anticipate a linear progression of revenue as we move through the balance of the year i’ll provide more detail on the metric shortly product revenues for the quarter were  million we performed above our expectations for the quarter in the us and japan this was offset by below plan performance in europe which is primarily attributable to the marginally extended conversion to revenue times that josh highlighted service revenues for the second quarter were  million compared with  million in the year ago period which was in line with our expectations turning to gross margins our overall gross margin for the quarter was  down  basis points compared with the prior year period and flat on a sequential basis product gross margins in the quarter decreased  basis points over the prior year period to  primarily driven by the lower overall unit sales volume as well as product and channel mix product and channel mix continue to be the most significant factor in regards to quarterly fluctuations in product margins as with the first fiscal quarter we again experienced a higher concentration of tomotherapy systems to revenue as compared to cyberknife in prior year we averaged an approximate onetoone ratio of cyberknife to tomotherapy revenues and in the first six month of  this mix has been two to one in favor of tomotherapy i would also highlight that overall pricing in the first half of  has been relatively stable to the year ago period and within our expectations we continue to anticipate an improvement in product gross margin in the second half of the fiscal year on higher revenue volumes and more favorable mix that should gross margins on a full year basis to be approximately flat as compared to the year ago period service gross margin in the fiscal second quarter of  were essentially flat with the year ago period we continue our focus on improved parts reliability and cost management and anticipate full year fiscal  service margins to be at or above fiscal  which were  operating expenses for the quarter decreased  from the prior year period to  million the  million decline included a  million decrease in rd a  million decrease in selling and marketing and the  million decrease in ga primarily due to lower legal expenses the contributing factor behind the lower operating expenses across all categories was incentive compensation and commission expenses as a result of lower sales volume adjusted ebitda was  million compared to  million in a year ago period we continue to have a particularly high level of confidence in our ability to effectively manage costs which ill touch on in our guidance shortly let’s now turn to the balance sheet we had  million of cash and investment at december   the  million sequential decrease in cash from the first quarter is primarily due to the timing of revenue collections which can be seen in the  million increase in accounts receivable additionally we used  million to pay down current debt balances turning to our capital structure we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet by reducing the potential dilution associated with our convertible debt we will report to you on our progress as development merits and we continue to believe accurate annual financial performance and growing backlog will provide greater options and flexibility turning now to our annual guidance for fiscal  we are today affirming the guidance originally provided back in august for all metrics except operating expenses as follows yearoveryear growth of approximately  for gross orders a revenue range of  to  million although our first half performance leads us to believe the lower end of the range is more likely independent primarily on two variables that i’ll explain shortly we’re expecting adjusted ebitda range of  to  million additionally given first half operating expense levels were below expectations we are lowering full year operating expenses to be down approximately  as compared to fiscal  given the lower operating expenses we do remain confident in our ability to achieve our adjusted ebitda range which would represent yearoveryear growth of between  and  with regard to full year revenue implicit in our revenue guidance are two variables that will impact our ability to achieve the revenue range josh mentioned our internal assumptions around expectations of a class a license announcement out of china in the third quarter china class a revenues comprise approximately  million to  million to our second half fiscal  revenue guidance additionally almost all of the china revenue contribution is now anticipated to be in our fourth quarter our revenue guidance also anticipates the shipments or installation of several distributed orders within the timeframe expected when these orders were entered in the backlog at this time we have no reason to believe the conversion of these orders to revenue will experience timing delays as with china our firm belief is that the conversion to revenue is purely a timing issue further we would anticipate closing out fiscal  with product system backlog of approximately  million which would be above the overall market growth rate we also anticipate q age outs to be approximately  million we anticipate that age outs as a percentage of backlog for the full year of fiscal  will be an improvement over fiscal s level of  and with that i would now like to hand the call back to josh joshua h levine thanks kevin before we open the call up to your questions id like to thank the entire accuray team for their focus and contribution to our performance in second quarter our companys commitment to the important work we are doing in improving the lives of cancer patients by providing leading edge treatment solutions remains central to our mission now operator were ready to open the call up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from josh jennings from cowen  company your line is open josh jennings hi good evening thanks gentlemen i was hoping to ask you a few questions on the sales funnel clearly the replacement cycle has set up nicely and any high level thoughts on how youre feeling about the de novo customer funnel at midyear versus the beginning of the year then on radixact and one of the promise of the platform that it will more fully open up to single and dual vault segments of the market and can you talk about the early radixact funnel and the mix of single and dual vault centers within it and then lastly you secured another multisystem order in fiscal q does the funnel include more potential multisystem orders as well joshua h levine so josh ill take in i guess in that sequence that the question were given let me talk a little bit about replacement cycle in general as weve characterized in the past the primary geographic focus is our us market and western europe across both platforms if you think about just the performance lets say in q and the contribution the bigger contribution in terms of product mix from a cyberknife standpoint right now across the entire installed base thats kind of coming into replacement cycle on cyberknife less than  of that installed base actually has the latest generation device so when you think about the opportunities for m mlc equipped people that are looking to build full body radio surgery programs we think we have a lot more ground to cover in terms of opportunities inside the installed base and thats represented by replacement cycle we talked a little bit about product advantages on both platforms i mean we have the basis here for confidence really comes from a better performing product on both platforms better functionality better speed better throughput better reliability and those things really translate into expanded clinical versatility in the minds of customers but also a growing addressable market opportunity for us so im pretty bullish on the continuation of momentum in the replacement sales piece in both the us market and western europe kevin waters yeah i could take your single and dual vault question we continue to experience the majority of our orders for radixact and tomotherapy in single and dual vault which has been really running now for probably last four or five quarters josh so that trend continued in the second quarter joshua h levine josh i think the last question you had was around radixact and kind of funnel and what our view is right now from an early assessment we are in still in this current quarter ramp and monitor ph which is really kind of a reference site installation optimization exercise that essentially makes sure that we’re creating the very best reference sites we can and understanding elements of installation that are specific to the new platform that program is not completed until the end of this quarter so the fiscal third quarter but quite frankly as you can see it’s not standing in the way of us taking orders for radixact so we’ve got sites in both the us and europe that are reference sites that we’ve already taken to revenue and that are all treating patients today and again we expect that they’ll be completed with ramp and monitor as a phase by the end of the third quarter but generally the feedback from those customers that now have patient treatment experiences with the new system has been really positive very strong feedback positive feedback about speed product performance and so much this is exceeding their expectations quite frankly so we’ve again a stronger sense that we’ve got with radixact a true workhorse product and a product that quite frankly is going to really meet the needs of a lot of customers josh jennings thanks for that sorry for the multipronged question just one followup just on the replacement cycle i dont  sorry if you guys commented on this in your prepared remarks but can you give us an idea whether you’re maintaining that replacement conversion rate and then lastly with radixact and with the next generation cyberknife with the incise mlc are you seeing any customers move up their replacement timeline to have the latest and greatest accuray technology platform earlier than say  years thanks for taking the questions guys kevin waters so ill start i will let josh come  followup on the timing we did see in the second quarter josh above i’d say historical performance on the replacement cycle we have said that you should expect in fiscal  for us to be in the  to  range as a percent of total orders we were north of that in the second quarter but i don’t get too excited about looking at it on a quarterly basis i think for fiscal  we’re still comfortable with placements being somewhere in the  to  range of total orders joshua h levine josh on the accelerated timing if you will part of the question again if you look at the profile of the typical location that we have our installed base equipment and you’re talking about large multibunker academic institutions generally a more complex case mix of patients that end up being treated in those institutions and in many cases people that lead those departments and those  the radiation oncology practice if you will at those medical centers are pretty wellknown key opinion leaders people that are still actively involved in research with those patient populations and our devices so there’s generally a desire to have what i would characterize as the latest and greatest if you will in terms of our equipment i think maybe in certain cases you see people that would  and have the capability from a budget and a flexibility standpoint to be able to go to upgrade perhaps sooner than a ten year replacement cycle but our expectations are that it isnt necessarily that that’s going to happen on a routine basis or a highly predictable basis we’ve got a lot to keep us busy quite frankly just at the level of replacement sale opportunity in front of us again it’s  plus systems across cyberknife and tomotherapy on both platforms and again i think we have a fairly robust view of the momentum if you will of replacement sales continuing josh jennings thanks for those answers appreciate it joshua h levine thanks josh operator and our next question comes from anthony petrone from jefferies your line is open anthony petrone thanks and good afternoon maybe i’ll start with a higher level question just on the market landscape and then move into a couple on guidance but maybe just josh and kevin if you provide an update on the competitive landscape just as it relates to elect and vary and maybe the similarities and differences around the landscape heading into calendar year  kevin waters so i’ll start anthony i think again if you look at where certainly where our replacement sales opportunity resides again youve got heavy concentration in the us and western europe in the us market the primary people were competing against is variant probably seven out of the ten bunkers that our sales people drive past have a variant device of one form or another running in those vaults so id say its a very  from a competitive scenario its a very variantcentric kind of landscape i think were doing a really good job of maintaining and retaining our existing bunkers and we are showing that with improved functionality and product capability and reliability weve got  in a competitive sense weve got the ability to convince single and dual vault locations that tomo and now radixact are really viable options for them where overtime if you look back over the last fourfive years that quite frankly historically wasnt the case so i think were feeling pretty good about the competitive dynamics again were not wining at  were not going to win at  but i think were being a more viable competitor quite frankly today than weve been at any point of time in my experience at accuray anthony petrone thats helpful and maybe just to clarify from a bunker size standpoint is tomo and radixact similar to sort of existing dimensions for the majority of those installed variant bunkers kevin waters yeah they would certainly be more characteristic of a relatively easy substitution relatively minimal bunker modification would be required so that certainly helps the discussion anthony petrone okay and then just on guidance youve mentioned distributor orders im just trying to get a sense of the difference in timing of revenue recognition sort of when you have a distributor order versus a direct sales order and maybe just the last question would be what do age outs and cancellations look like with respect to distributor orders versus direct orders thanks kevin waters yeah so ill answer your age out question first our age outs historically have been primarily distributor orders as compared to direct orders with that said the comments i made about expecting age outs in  to improve as a percentage of backlog over fiscal s level of  takes into account the increase in the revenue conversion cycle that both josh and i highlighted so weve already factored in any impact that would have in our age out guidance your first question with regards to differences in conversion timing i mean the fact is it does vary by region and youre going to see some differences i think in this quarter we are impacted primarily as i mentioned on the revenue side by our distributors in the european region primarily the nonwestern european regions where we use distributors however on a positive note we highlighted i think in our third quarter call last year japan which is a region where we are  distributor and weve actually seen that conversion process improve over the last six to nine months so much so that japan now in the first half of  is representing approximately  of total company revenues as compared to  in the first half of  so its vary region specific macro factor specific but the weakness and the delays we saw in the first half of  were primarily europe anthony petrone very helpful thanks operator and our next question comes from tycho peterson from jpmorgan your line is open unidentified analyst hey guys thanks its actually patrick in for tycho maybe just to expand on anthonys question on revenue conversion definitely understand its more difficult to handicap given distributors all that direct control but now that youve kind of identified that as a problem and increased focus on it is there anything you can do to accelerate conversion from the distributors or how youre thinking about improving that a little bit joshua h levine yeah so patrick its a great question we just as a little bit of background on the resources that we usually have involved when were involved in a direct sale and then where we have primary responsibility for installation weve got installation teams and essentially revenue conversion teams in our regions that are working with end user facilities on site planning elements and site planning details working on installation details and bunker modification components  elements of the process and coordination quite frankly in some cases with contractors locally to support those activities that i just described those resources are our resources that are dedicated and they’re focused by region and when were direct sales mechanism and we’ve got responsibility for installation those resources are highly engaged actively engaged in a really endtoend process with the site and institution the end user institution we are trying to work more closely with distributors to find out its – it’s really a little bit of the help us help you discussion we’re working with them to find out what we can bring with regards to some of the resources i just described that would help augment or help support perhaps in ways that they’re not capable of on their own those – the execution if you will of those activities that i just described so we’ve got a large number of independent distributors that we work with in different parts of the world but this is not necessarily an exercise for us where we’ve got to support every one of them these  the orders are probably more heavily concentrated in again as kevin described before central europe certainly as of – most recently japan  well that’s an improving situation as kevin highlighted so we have  i think we have the resources from the accuray side that need to be engaged in these conversations with distributors pushing and expanding their involvement perhaps if you will in efforts to move this process forward in a more expedited fashion unidentified analyst okay that’s helpful and then may be one for kevin just on gross margins now they’re obviously a bit soft in the first half now looking out  you guys gave at the analyst day the longer term target of  maybe just talk to your confidence level in that number and the key leverage to get you there from obviously a lower base coming off first half of the year kevin waters yeah so as i mentioned your question really is two parts on the second quarter as i said the most significant factor continues to be really mix and we were hurt in the first half of the year by product mix having a high ratio of tomo revenues and also just an overall lower sales volume we still think given our forecast for the back half for the year we can get back to essentially flat product margins in  as compared to  longer term we still continue to work towards the goal we put forward on analyst day of  overall margins this would represent service margins in the low  range product margins in the high s revenue improvements are an obvious factor in regard to margin improvements but another thing we are also working on as a company which we haven’t talked about in a few quarters we do remain focused on cost down initiatives on our systems and we are currently investing in several large standing engineering products which will not benefit fiscal  but it is going to contribute as we head into  and  so i don’t view our overall margin results in the first six months as any risk or indication that we can’t get to where we want to get to in fiscal  unidentified analyst understood and maybe just one last one you guys mentioned japan an increase in product revenue i don’t think you’ve shown any improvement to radixact yet so maybe what are you anticipating that what’s the visibility there on that and then how significant is the opportunity for radixact thank you kevin waters yes so we’ve submitted all the necessary paper work for showing ph an approval in japan and we expect that very shortly we expect in our fiscal third quarter operator operator instructions and our next question comes from brandon henry from rbc capital markets your line is open brandon henry yeah thanks for taking my question motion management its an important differentiator for cyberknife that’s not yet available on the radixact platform so can you provide us with an update on the timeline for the motion management for radixact and then discuss how important you think this technology will be in driving tomotherapy replacements and i have a followup question kevin waters brandon it’s a great question the – what you describe in terms of capability on cyberknife which is the motion management capability the software component to that which is the automated theme adjustment capability through synchrony these are similar technology upgrades that we believe are going to be really pretty central to longer term adoption and utility of radixact going forward this is a highly upgradable platform that will allow for motion tracking overtime motion correction in terms of beam ph correction overtime so if you think about how cyberknife has evolved radixact would look again different platform obviously but would look similar in terms of how it tracts along those upgradability pathways if you will and this is a major at least my feedback this is a major part of the thought process for those customers that are looking at considering radixact in the replacement sales discussion again if you think it about it in terms of our existing installed base we’re taking a customer with earlier generation product and even in an upgraded form that earlier generation product will never get to the level of capability from a functionality perspective that radixact will given the functionality improvements that i just described and we havent been specifically quite frankly about timing but i would say that we feel pretty good about the rate at which or the pace at which we are moving through our technology roadmap and advancing the development of these incremental product capabilities brandon henry okay and then just a couple of questions first have you seen any differences in the historical win rate for replacements for tomotherapy versus cyberknife and then also the replacement rates for the us versus international market joshua h levine no we haven’t i think the answer would be its too early to draw any definitive conclusions we’re very early in this replacement cycle i will say the first half of  yielded positive results on both product platforms we saw in the us predominantly all replacement sales and also predominantly cyberknife related while in the ous we saw a nice mix of replacement sales and the competitive wins across both platforms so i don’t think  i think it’s too early in the cycle brandon to draw any conclusion we’re performing kind of at or above our expectations on replacements sales across both product platforms at the movement brandon henry okay and then final question from me you mentioned that operating expenses will now be down  to  for this fiscal year versus i think previous guidance of kind of flat can you talk about where the cost reduction is coming from and also if fiscal second half revenue performance does fall short of expectations are there additional opportunities for cost cutting that would still allow you to meet your fiscal year  adjusted ebitda guidance thanks kevin waters yeah i believe so so we finished for the first six months of  roughly down  million in opex or  below prior year  roughly  of that is attributable to legal expenses ill call them nonrecurring and what you seeing in the first half is lower revenue levels leaving to decreased compensation expenses and decreased commission expenses and our guidance right now of operating expenses down  assumes were within our revenue range of  to  million and if we would be below that range i think it’s fair to suggest that our operating expenses could potentially be down less than  primarily due to the two factors on compensation that i just mentioned which by the way in my prepared remarks i had said thats what gives us i’d say particularly higher level of confidence in our ability to achieve our ebitda range brandon henry okay thank you kevin waters no problem operator and at this time i’m showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks joshua h levine thank you operator and thank you everyone for your participation on this afternoon’s call we look forward to talking with you again on our fiscal

operator instructions as a reminder todays conference is being recorded id now like to introduce your host for todays conference mr doug sherk sir please go ahead douglas sherk thank you liz and good afternoon everyone welcome to accurays conference call to review financial results for the third quarter of fiscal  which ended on march   as well as recent corporate developments joining us today are josh levine accurays president and chief executive officer and kevin waters accurays senior vice president and chief financial officer before we begin id like to remind you that our call today includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our business plans and strategies as well as our outlook for fiscal  there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations including but not limited to risks associated with the adoption of the cyberknife tomotherapy onrad and radixact systems commercial execution future order growth future revenue growth and macroeconomic factors outside of the companys control these and other risks are more fully described in the press release we issued after the market closed this afternoon as well as in our filings with the securities and exchange commission the forwardlooking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of todays date and we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements operator instructions now id like to turn the call over to accurays president and chief executive officer josh levine joshua levine thank you doug good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on todays call following the market close today we reported third quarter financial results highlighted by strong growth for both gross orders and backlog gross orders for the third quarter increased  yearoveryear to  million while our backlog grew to a record  million which is approximately  higher than prior year this built upon our second quarter gross order results that we reported in late january which were also ahead of our expectations these order results help illustrate why we reiterated our gross order guidance for the full year back in january and are doing so again today at the same time our revenue results in the third quarter were moderated by the continued delay in the announcement of class a radiotherapy licenses in china and the long revenue conversion time associated with a higher mix of distributor source orders we have pointed out during our q earnings call that our full year revenue outlook could potentially be impacted by these  factors and this was proven to be the case as a result were recasting our full year revenue outlook to a range of  million to  million while were encouraged by our continued momentum in order growth were not pleased with the trends related to the timing of revenue conversion and are announcing today a number of executivelevel personnel and structural organization changes with a focus in  key areas first to ensure that we build on our recent order momentum second to improve our revenue conversion time lines in those regions where distributorinitiated orders have become a bigger part of the overall order mix in our backlog and lastly to drive a more streamlined executivelevel structure to improve our overall market responsiveness the first of these changes is the elimination of the chief operating officer position held by kelly londy and the promotion of lionel hadjadjeba the senior vice president and chief commercial officer kelly will remain with accuray through the end of the fiscal year to ensure a smooth transition and i deeply appreciate her many contributions to accuray over her year tenure at the same time i look forward to working more directly with lionel and his commercial management team to drive our business as chief commercial officer lionel will bring a high level of focus accountability and urgency to our commercial sales efforts additionally in this role lionel will help bridge and link the multiple departments and personnel that are involved in customerfacing activities some of which are regionally based and some of which come from our headquarter location in sunnyvale and our international subsidiary location outside of geneva switzerland lionel joined accuray in  as the president of our international business and most recently has been leading the worldwide sales and service organization in this new role lionel will remain  will maintain worldwide responsibility for all our sales regions while reporting directly to me lionel will lead all of the corporate and regionbased customerfacing activities and processes that impact commercial momentum including sales marketing service medical affairs training and medical education additionally we announced today the creation of a dedicated vice president of revenue management position that will report to kevin waters our chief financial officer this position will be responsible for driving the revenue forecast and overseeing the ordertorevenue conversion process for the company by working closely with our regional installation service and commercial teams to ensure we will improve the overall timing and cadence of system installation and ultimately revenue conversion turning back to the quarters results our third quarter order results validate customer market perceptions about our improved product functionality performance and reliability accurays competitive position for both product and service offerings continues to strengthen and on a global basis we continue to win more competitive bunkers than we lose in addition our product portfolio is strongly aligned with  of the fastestgrowing radiotherapy treatment segments imageguided imrt and sbrt the latest generation of our tomotherapy product platform radixact has continued to contribute to our order growth since the early rollout phase of reference sites began late last calendar year im happy to announce we have completed the ramp in monitor phase of the commercial launch process and as of todays call full commercial launch is now underway we have received positive feedback from all of our reference sites in the us and europe that confirm radixacts improvements in treatment planning and overall treatment speed as the standout differentiating attributes of the system while still providing our customers with the unparalleled treatment precision of the tomotherapy architecture for their most challenging cases as an example we have received feedback from one of our reference sites at a new stateoftheart cancer center in south florida this customer has routinely been treating over  patients per day within a standard daily treatment schedule customers at our other reference sites have shared similarly positive feedback the radixact system is proving itself to be a platform that can treat the broadest range of cancer patients quickly and precisely making it a viable choice as a mainstream clinical treatment option in another positive piece of radixact news in january we received shonin approval in japan for radixact and were able to secure several radixact orders from that market during the fiscal third quarter which exceeded our expectations additionally we expect our first radixact patient treated in japan sometime in fiscal q accurays second new product onrad also provided a modest contribution to our fiscal q gross orders which was in line with our expectations and were continuing to focus on advancing the provincial tender processes and building our sales funnel for this segment of the market as we had communicated in our last call we expected initial onrad order uptake in q with order momentum ramping from there moving to cyberknife we saw continued market interest and order momentum during the third quarter cyberknife orders represented approximately  of our gross order dollars in the quarter we believe much of this momentum can be attributed to the better clinician and patient experiences provided by the cyberknife m system including greater functionality with the mlcenabling treatment of a broader case range with faster planning and treatment times we also believe market awareness and confidence in cyberknifes unique capabilities for treating prostate cancer which is the fastestgrowing cancer diagnosis in the male population is helping to drive prospective customer interest recently emerging clinical data about cyberknifes capabilities in the treatment of prostate cancer is having a positive effect on customer awareness the most recent cyberknife study was presented at the ascosponsored genitourinary cancers symposium by dr donald fuller in february dr fullers study showed that cyberknife treatments for treating localized prostate cancer can be successfully delivered by communitybased centers as well as academic hospitals  of the  patients in the study were treated at facilities identifying themselves as communitybased nonacademic across the united states and after a year followup  of the  patients lowrisk patients treated by cyberknife remain diseasefree and  of the intermediaterisk patients treated remain diseasefree importantly the study also found that toxicity levels in the  patients treated with cyberknife compare favorably to the toxicity levels of other radiotherapies dr fullers results mirror the clinically significant cyberknifespecific sbrt prostate study presented at astro last september by dr robert meier when taken together the clinical findings of both of these important studies represent the first truly devicespecific data with long term patient followup and validate cyberknifes unique capabilities and clinical value for safely and effectively treating low and intermediaterisk prostate patients clinical studies at the time led by doctors meier and fuller help clinically validate and continue to drive the broader market trends were seeing in the shift towards sbrt and hypofractionated treatment delivery in another example of how cyberknife is transforming prostate treatment delivery feedback from one of the largest volume multidisciplinary urology practices in the us indicated that they had recently treated their th patient  prostate patient with their mlcequipped cyberknife since installing the m system in october of  with a significant ramp in the number of patients over the last  years we believe the most recently released clinical data on the treatment of prostate cancer with cyberknife can be particularly powerful in the upcoming months when cms is expected to release a report on episodic payments both astro and acro have submitted proposals to cms on episodic payment models these proposals if adopted would position hyperfractionation which is what our technologies are extremely well suited to provide in favorable reimbursement position additionally the us preventative services task force has issued draft screening guidelines for prostate cancer that rather than discouraging screening advised patients to discuss screening with their doctors we anticipate finalization of those guidelines later this calendar year and believe they will be a positive catalyst that will likely bring patients in for earlier diagnosis and treatment finally id like to have a  say a few words about customer feedback at the beginning of this month we held the accuray aero users summit in chicago while this summit enables our customers to share best practices and learn about innovative approaches to improving treatment results for their patients it also enables our management team to gather customer feedback over the course of the day event we met with more than  customers representing a broad crosssection of large academic institutions as well as smaller regional and communitybased facilities and received an overwhelming level of support and positive feedback for the improvements we have made to the functionality and reliability of our product portfolio we believe that the organizational changes we announced today will result in improved consistency and execution of both orders and revenue conversion timing the growth drivers we have laid out for our business remain firmly in place namely the growing need for radiotherapy devices globally the positioning of accurays product portfolio in the fastestgrowing treatment segments of the market the growing body of data illustrating the clinical efficacy of accurays technology and the upcoming replacement sales opportunity in our installed base with systems entering their year replacement window and with that id like to turn the call over to kevin kevin waters thank you josh and good afternoon everyone as josh highlighted we ended the third quarter with backlog of  million representing growth of  over the prior year our q performance included gross orders of  million and net orders of  million reflecting ageouts of  million  cancellation for  million and  of negative foreign currency impact ageouts in the quarter were better than we anticipated as an order which we expected to ageout ended up being shipped during the quarter gross order performance was favorably impacted by both our new radixact system as well as significantly more cyberknife system orders compared to the same prior year period order growth by geography was driven by strong performance in asia pacific japan and our european region on a yeartodate basis order growth is up  over the first  months of prior year additionally our replacement order rates have continued at a consistent pace during the first  months of fiscal  turning now to our income statement total revenue for the third quarter was  million representing an increase of  on a sequential basis this compares to revenue of  million in the year ago period product revenue for the quarter was  million product revenues in both the us and japan were significantly above prior year revenues however as josh touched on both china and the longer revenue conversion times particularly in europe negatively impacted q revenue performance service revenue for the third quarter was  million compared with  million in the year ago period which was slightly below our expectations due to less installation and training revenue which coincides with the shortfall in product revenues turning now to gross margins our overall gross margin for the quarter was  compared with the prior year period gross margin of  primarily driven by reduced product gross margins product gross margins decreased  basis points over the prior year primarily driven by the lower overall unit sales volume as well as product and channel mix overall pricing was stable as compared to the year ago period and within our expectations product gross margins should improve sequentially in the fourth quarter on higher unit sales volume however on a full year basis product margins will now be approximately  to  which is due to a combination of product and channel mix and lower overall revenues service gross margins in the fiscal third quarter were  as compared with  in the year ago period on a yeartodate basis service margins are  which are slightly below prior yeartodate performance of  we continue our focus on improved parts reliability and cost management and continue to anticipate full year fiscal  service margins to be at or above  which were  operating expenses for the quarter were  million this  reduction compared to the prior year was driven by a  million decrease in ga and an  decrease in rd while we had a slight increase of  in selling and marketing our improvement in ga was the result of lower legal expenses while rd was the result of lower development expenses primarily related to prior year costs associated with the development of the radixact system adjusted ebitda was  million compared to  million in the year ago period adjusted ebitda through the first  months of the fiscal year was  million compared to  million in the prior year turning to the balance sheet we had  million of cash and investments at march   the  million sequential decrease in cash from the second quarter is due to restricting  million to satisfy future payment obligations associated with our term loan and also a decrease from working capital usage with regard to our fourth quarter cash flows we expect to generate positive cash flow primarily through a decrease in working capital on reduced accounts receivable and inventory balances with respect to our outstanding convertible debt that is due in february  were currently evaluating all financing sources that will allow us to either refinance our existing convertible debt or provide the cash necessary to settle the debt in cash at maturity thus avoiding additional potential dilution turning now to our annual guidance for fiscal  were today updating our guidance as follows yearoveryear growth of approximately  for gross orders which is unchanged from our previous guidance revenue within the range of approximately  million to  million this compares to our previous guidance range of  million to  million and reflects a reduction due to the delay in the issuance of china class a licenses and extended revenue conversion timing associated with distributor orders our outlook for adjusted ebitda is a range of  million to  million compared to  million to  million previously and reflects our revised revenue outlook and an operating expense decline of  to  compared to the prior year the operating expense decline from previously issued guidance is primarily due to less incentive compensation expenses associated with the revised revenue range we anticipate closing out fiscal  with product system backlog of approximately  million to  million this includes q ageouts of approximately  million to  million ageout as a percentage of ending backlog for the full year fiscal  would represent a slight improvement over fiscal  and ending backlog would show growth of  to  over prior year and with that i would now like to hand the call back to josh joshua levine thanks kevin before we open up the call for your questions id like to thank the entire accuray team for their focus and contribution this quarter our companys commitment to the important work were doing in improving the lives of cancer patients by providing leadingedge treatment solutions remains central to our mission and now operator were ready to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of tycho peterson with jpmorgan tycho peterson josh maybe on the distributor dynamics i know you called this out last quarter but you had reaffirmed guidance last quarter and kind of anticipated that this would be kind of a manageable issue can you maybe just talk about to the extent that you are taking steps  and i know you talked a little bit about this in the last earnings call in terms of trying to accelerate that conversion maybe just talk about any incremental progress youve had there and how long do you think it takes to resolve these issues joshua levine so i think weve made some progress but i dont think that progress tyco has been enough its one of the reasons why were putting the role that we described in our prepared remarks in place and getting better focus on and better alignment i think that  you remember the conversation we had at the end of last quarter this is a consequence quite frankly in terms of the mix  the order mix in the backlog its primarily in the markets or regions where we have bigger distributor order growth taking place and as a consequence we basically dont have the same clear line of sight around those basic activities that are  were managing on our own in the direct business like site planning installation planning coordination of contractors we have a distributor in the middle of those conversations we have an end user that were trying to coordinate calendarization of those activities with which creates a longer revenue conversion cycle the strategy and the thought process around the vp of revenue role is that we have one person there at that point that drives the forecasting process but the details that underpin the forecasting process such as the entire endtoend order revenue conversion process so coordination working with our regional installation and service teams coordinating with the distribution partners and the enduser facilities to ensure that weve got essentially the pieces moving in the right direction to improve installation cadence and execution and so there are some process changes that i think that will take place i dont see those as sweeping but the creation of this dedicated role focused on this process from end to end i think will be a very very helpful piece to improved forecast predictability and i also think that having this position report to kevin waters puts added visibility and a sense of process discipline and urgency to it that quite frankly in my view have been somewhat lacking so thats the highlevel thought process about the strategy with it tycho peterson okay and then for my followup just on competitive dynamics last quarter i think you talked about winning  to  of replacement orders is that kind of still holding and as we think about early interest in onrad how do you think about just competitive dynamics there obviously varian is talking about launching a new lowerend system for emerging markets as well joshua levine yes so nothing has changed with regards to the order mix and whats impacting it were still seeing roughly  to  of the order mix coming from the installed base replacement opportunities the  that means by definition the remaining roughly  to  of orders are coming either from greenfield opportunities or competitive opportunities and so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we  on a global basis were still seeing winning at a higher rate than were giving up our own bunkers so we feel good about that radixact has been a good contributor albeit early in that discussion we have order activity in the third quarter thats radixact related and this is the first quarter of true full commercial launch so we have basically all of our reference sites now up and running and actively treating patients which is going to help expand the sales process and the advancement in terms of sales funnel for this in general weve heard the market chatter about what varian may or may not be coming to the market with an escrow but at this point its too early to speculate on what that might mean or what the potential impact of that is weve gotten really good feedback from the sites that are using radixact in terms of tangible differences in the treatment planning capability and treatment speed so we feel good about early functionality early feedback on functionality at this point that radixact has been getting operator our next question comes from josh jennings with cowen and company joshua jennings i was hoping to follow up on the revenue conversion issue and can you just help us think about as we get into fiscal  and you anniversary the revenue conversion lag times how does that start to play out clearly you have some new people in place and youre trying to optimize the path forward but once you anniversary the lag times will you be able to manage that better or does it just continue to cause issues in terms of revenue recognition kevin waters josh this is kevin so were not going to comment on  guidance specifically well do that on our next call but just in a general sense our revenue growth rates going forward should more appropriately reflect the growth in our product revenue backlog and thats not whats occurring this year and we think by making some of these process changes we could have the future more appropriately reflect those growth rates id also use an analogy here and if you look at a country like japan which is  distributor where we cited their increased revenue conversion process in fiscal  weve been able to put a high level of focus there and were now seeing japan for example perform significantly above plan and be a big contributor to our results and thats the analogy i would use when i look moving forward in regards to us doing what we can do on distributor conversion joshua jennings great and the growth rates in that order delta it was the smallest gap in many quarters you talked about one order that you thought might fall out off of that but that you  that went  turned into an installation but are there any trends that we should be thinking about in terms of that gap narrowing as we move forward here kevin waters yes i dont think theres any trend i think  i also pointed out that ageouts are going to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter in our prepared remarks but to put ageouts in perspective weve highlighted increased revenue conversion times weve seen others in the industry talk about this phenomenon as well and were going to end  with approximately  million of orders that are older than  months id like to point out that of those  million that have aged out only  million of those have subsequently been canceled by the end user so while we report ageouts i do believe that the remaining  million do have the potential to be future revenue and were seeing a bit of increased ageouts in our fourth quarter due to this increase in conversion timing joshua jennings great and my last question just on the service revenue not dramatically lower but it trended lower in q here than weve seen in numerous quarters how should would be thinking about service revenue growth maybe what happened in q for the sequential downtick and then how we should be thinking about service revenue growth going forward kevin waters yes so ill speak to the sequential downtick so service revenue is dependent on product revenue as well so we record installation and training revenue at the same time as we have installs and when we have a quarter like we did in this fiscal third quarter where distributors in japan for example perform very well were not responsible for installation in those markets and therefore we see a decline in installation and training revenue on top of that we also had less upgrade revenue in our fiscal third quarter we think our service revenue growth rate should improve as we head into  as we have more upgrades to offer and we can start to fill that pipeline again operator our next question comes from amit hazan with citi unidentified analyst this is phil ph on for amit i guess ill start with the other side of guidance maybe great order number from a gross perspective and through  quarters just what went into the decision i guess not to take that guidance level up for the rest of the year was there any pull forward that we saw or what went into that decision kevin waters i think just to be quite honest given our trends and were sitting on a call here where weve lowered revenue guidance were happy with our full year order guidance however q would still suggest a number of approximately  million which would represent a quarterly high for us in  we believe thats attainable due to the strength of our funnel but we just didnt feel it was appropriate even though were ahead of our expectations to look at raising that metric at the time with that said as we exit  our second half growth rate orders would be kind of in the  to  range and i think thats pointing to a lot of the initiatives that josh highlighted in terms of the full radixact launch and some of our success in the replacement cycle but again were happy to be ahead where we expect it to be but we just thought given the q absolute numbers its still a large number it wouldnt be appropriate to raise that metric unidentified analyst right understood sounds good maybe just a little bit higher level any comment on either pricing or purchasing trends maybe in light of political ahca uncertainty anything youve seen there would be great joshua levine no impact phil ph at least from an ahca discussion standpoint and id say pricing has continued to operate or flow at the levels that we expected it to we dont see any major degradation there so id say its fairly stable operator our next question comes from the line of brandon henry with rbc capital markets brandon henry so you guys lowered revenue guidance by  million can you help me parse out what the impact was from the continued delay from chinese class a quotas and then what the impact was in the longer distributor conversions kevin waters yes so its roughly equal so the china class a delay we were anticipating approximately  million to  million in the back half of our fiscal year and probably more in the high end there so youre looking at a  million shortfall from china class a and then itd be a roughly equal contribution from the delay of the distributor orders that josh discussed that distributor conversion by the way id point out was primarily for orders in eastern europe due both to construction and enduser project delays brandon henry okay and then separately you guys mentioned that astro and acro are working on bundled payment model for radiation oncology can you give us a sense regarding the potential timing of implementation of these initiatives and how quickly you think theyll be rolled out joshua levine brandon we dont have  were tracking it but we dont have any greater insights than you do on timing we know that the inputs to cms have been made and cms is expected to release a report sometime fairly soon but dont have visibility on exact timing of that so i guess its a stay tuned kind of answer but again our takeaway on this is that when you think about episodic payment structures and models and you think about what really is implied there with regards to the opportunity both clinically for the patient overall experience for the patient and the payer market impact in terms of the economics  the health economic impact of this all signs point to the fact that hypofractionated treatment sbrt in a hypofractionated form is really a good solution for all of those constituencies that i just talked about and we quite frankly think were really well positioned with our current portfolio to help take advantage of that i guess from a timing standpoint we think this is relatively soon maybe this summer but again i dont know  we dont have an exact time frame operator our next question comes from christian moore with jefferies christian moore maybe one on radixact it seems like its progressing well we were just wondering if you could help quantify the contributions to the gross orders and just by geography a little color on what youre seeing in radixact uptake obviously its in japan now and how the ramp in europe and us is going as well kevin waters yes this is kevin so we have said that roughly  of our orders were cyberknife orders in joshs remarks which means the other  are on the tomotherapy platform were not going to break out what amount of tomotherapy platform orders were the h series versus radixact what i will say is that we did have  radixact was a significant contributor to that number we did have initial placements in japan with shonin approval which we received in january which was above our expectations and then we also have ce mark for radixact in the eurozone and also obviously fda approval and so thats why continue to sell that product christian moore and then maybe one just on the upcoming astro conference have you factored in anything from a competitive launch standpoint in terms of what varian is expected to be bringing into the market for fiscal  or beyond in your models and is there anything else that investor  that you want us to be paying attention to joshua levine yes i mean i think the direct answer on factoring things into forward looking in fact is  when i say forward looking i guess im referring to fiscal  were not going to be talking about guidance or expectations on  until we get to our yearend earnings release but we  the forecast that were running to from an internal standpoint are to take into account what we know right now and again i think i indicated before that we have heard some market noise customer noise about a varian product launch in escrow but we dont have any further information than you do beyond what was communicated yesterday in varians release it sounds like its a product that may be more focused on emerging markets but i think thats at this point speculation on what it means and specific impact its too early to really predict operator our next question comes from the line of sean lavin with btig ryan zimmerman this is actually ryan on for sean so just one for kevin with the operational changes underway and the process improvements related to revenue conversion should we be thinking about any onetime charges or nonrecurring charges over the next few quarters as you guys implement those processes kevin waters no in fact all of the discussion  changes that josh referenced any onetime severance thing is already factored into our operating expense guidance that we gave i would expect that as we staff this function there could be additional adds but nothing material wed still be able to adhere to kind of our operating expense run rate so nothing unusual there operator showing no
