investing specialist avenue capital group said energy debt offers a onceinalifetime opportunity after plunges in oil and other commodity prices left many companies overleveraged speaking at the recent reuters global investment outlook summit in new york lasry said the amount of distressed debt in energy had grown this year to between roughly  billion and  billion from  billion he said that offers opportunities for patient investors not bent on making a quick buck energy today is a onceinalifetime opportunity said lasry either you will get paid off or you will become the new equity of these companies but you need the luxury of time you need to be able to wait two or three or four years lasry oversees  billion at new yorkbased avenue he also became coowner of the national basketball associations milwaukee bucks last year avenue is among a handful of firms that have raised money in recent months for a dedicated energy fund lasry closed the avenue energy opportunities fund lp in july after raising  billion only to see the market become more distressed senior secured debt that was once available for  cents on the dollar now fetches  cents to  cents he said the whole market is oversold and were trying to take advantage lasry said he said the new fund has been investing  percent to  percent of its assets each month biding its time as prices across the sector move further downward lasry acknowledged that the fund lost money in its first few months but added that it has investor money locked up for roughly seven years so there is no hurry to sell for other investment firms primarily mutual funds that must return investor capital on demand and hedge funds that promise to return it more quickly recent heavy losses have become a problem forcing some investors to resort to hasty selling at inopportune times lasry said the oil slump will hurt exploration and production companies he said but prices will always come back the question is does it take six months or does it take three years lasry said avenue was also raising money for a new fund that will invest in europe with a focus on banks in great britain germany switzerland and nordic countries
