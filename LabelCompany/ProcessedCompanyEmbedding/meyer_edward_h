biggest — and most profitable — agencies continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story but now even mr meyer concedes it is time for him to go a decision grey global intends to announce formally today along with details of succession plans“a couple of years ago i realized i was not immortal” mr meyer who joined grey in  in the account service department said in an

chief executive of wpp said in an interview comparing mr meyer’s track record at grey global with the achievements of splashier agencies that are only “ years  years old”“the test is over time” mr sorrell said adding “it’s not a meter dash it’s a marathon he has built an integrated operation with very big clients procter  gamble nokia glaxosmithkline it’s not short term and sexy it’s long term and powerful”“if i had been there  years ago would i have done it necessarily the same way” mr sorrell asked rhetorically referring to mr meyer’s model of centralizing operations“maybe not” he continued “but the results speak for themselves grey grey health care g gci mediacom wing latino” those are among the principal divisions of grey global which handle tasks in addition to advertising that include digital marketing media planning and buying design and marketing aimed at hispanic consumersmr meyer acknowledged that he had faced vociferous critics of the way he ran grey global“i built my career and the agency on the belief clients come first and the job of the guy at the head of the agency is to know their needs” mr meyer said “not what they like for dinner but their advertising needs better than anyone at the agency advertisement continue reading the main story “i built auxiliary services here like direct marketing not because i’m a genius but because i got an early alert i heard my clients talking about them” he added “if i waited for the guy or gal running the account to get that information to me it’d be a year later”comparing himself with some other chief executives in the s through the s mr meyer said “i was one of the few guys who owned a big hunk of the agency he ran every penny i had was in here so i had more at stake than anyone else”“i sweated it harder i overruled people because i couldn’t afford to be a nice guy”mr meyer said he noticed contradictions among the complaints “i used to get criticism because there was so little turnover and yet i was called a ‘benevolent dictator’ who was harsh on people” he said “if i was why didn’t they leave”now however mr meyer is taking a more mellow view“i’ve had a year run and i had the opportunity to wake up one day and say ‘it’s been enough’ ” he said joking that he did not think he had “another  years in me” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify
