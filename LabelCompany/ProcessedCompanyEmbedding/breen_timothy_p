politics shaped american independence new york oxford university press  x   pp  cloth isbn  reviewed for ehnet by farley grubb department of economics university of delaware t h breen presents two propositions  during the middle fifty years of the eighteenth century nothing short of a revolution occurred in colonial consumerism colonists became awash in imported british consumer goods that in turn transformed their world materialistically socially and conceptually — even down to the meanest members of colonial society and the colonists were selfaware or conscious of this transformation  this new consumerism influenced revolutionary politics not merely by giving the colonists a weapon to use against the british — the boycotting of british imports — but by providing the colonists a tool with which to assess the degree of patriotic commitment not only of one’s neighbors but of fellow colonists in distant colonies those who did not adhere to the cause against the british by boycotting british goods such as tea either because they were free riders or because they did not believe in the cause could be easily spotted by their outward consumerism they could then be chastised in some way thus stopping free riding from destroying concerted action against the british and by identifying the “traitors” in their midst driving the traitors off or silencing them the end result was that the new consumerism provided the vehicle that allowed cohesive and concerted crosscolony action on a massmobilization level against the british now in some ways this is all old news that colonial imports of european consumer goods in the fifty years before the revolution rose substantially is well known that the colonists used the boycotting of british imports as a political weapon from the stamp act through the townsend duties and tea act is well known that colonists who did not tow the line on the boycotts were spotted and threatened is also reasonably well known so what is new here well it is the rich detail with which breen makes his case if you ever doubted any of these things or doubted their pivotal importance then that doubt will be wiped away by breen’s thorough and detailed presentation the first  pages of the book are given over to demonstrating proposition  not “how” or “why” this revolution in consumption occurred but merely “that” it occurred — from every conceivable angle using every possible type of evidence breen uses evidence from traveler accounts from official government correspondence from government customs records from newspapers from probate inventories from archaeological digs from museum artifacts and so on to make his case this section also has my favorite sentence in the book “from museums we move to trash” the material is presented in a seemingly endless set of individual stories that after awhile start to seem all the same faced with this tediously turgid presentation my eyes glossed over and only masochistic perseverance got me through while reading this section all i could think of were images of the author going from archive to archive library to library jotting down stories on note cards or into computer files and then feeling compelled to tell us every single story he had found a few stories are entertaining in their own right but only a few but there is a reward for perseverance breen’s methodology is more like that of an impressionist artist than an economic scientist using this analogy breen is applying the technique of pointillism such as that used by georges seurat in his painting “a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte” if you stand too close it looks just like a seemingly endless mess of points with each point looking somewhat the same and conveying little individually but when you step back and take in the whole all of a sudden an undeniably powerful yet fuzzy truth appears — namely proposition  while breen does not talk about this for economists his finding presents an important challenge — namely how to reconcile breen’s undeniable revolution in consumption behavior with even the most liberal estimates of the rate of economic growth in colonial america that colonists even the meanest of them on a per capita basis were incredibly better off in some utility sense in  than they were in  from this revolution in the consumption of imported goods seems undeniable yet economists typically find per capita economic growth to be miniscule this is a puzzle that economists need to address better or reconcile more sensibly than what they have yet done the final  pages of the book are given over to demonstrating proposition  while breen uses the same technique or methodology here as he used for proposition  the nature of proposition  makes the outcome less satisfying and more speculative at best we can say that consumer politics went on or somehow “shaped” or “influenced” american independence but by how much is harder to pin down at one point breen asserts that this consumer revolution was a “necessary” but not a “sufficient” condition for success in marshalling forces to american independence but this is undemonstrated and i don’t think it was even a “necessary” condition that the course of events took this particular shape is interesting and noteworthy but it was not necessary in some grander sense at least not well demonstrated as such what breen does convey well is that it wasn’t just the power of consumer boycotts in an economic sense that mattered but the power to affect collective consciousness over some common issue by the marshalling of massparticipation that came with this particular application of consumer boycotts that was important while breen does not use this language or present it in this way an economist will readily see the issue as how to marshal and maintain collective action in the face of freerider incentives when using consumer boycotts as a political tool breen clearly demonstrates the prevalence of the incentive to free ride and the response to it via the rise of extralegal devices to enforce compliance while breen illustrates the intrusive power of these compliance devices he probably underplays the terror inflicted not just on the freeriders and fencesitters but also on those who did not agree with this action and legally wanted not to go along by the extralegal patriotic committees and mobs who seemingly scrutinized and publicized every outward action of consumption and even invaded peoples’ homes to scrutinize their nonpublic behavior in consumption but even after two hundred years it is hard to openly talk about the terror used by patriots in the name of a cause we still hold dear in general the evidence is heavily weighted toward the new england new york and philadelphia regions it would have been nice to have more evidence from a broader swath of colonial locations finally it would have been nice if breen would not have presumed that the “” colonies were the only colonies why did this story of consumer revolution shaping the politics of revolution and knitting the colonies together into concerted action somehow stop at new hampshire and georgia and not affect montreal halifax kingston bridgetown and so on or if it did why did it yield a different outcome illuminating such would make a nice extension to or even a test of the importance of breen’s propositions farley grubb is professor of economics university of delaware his two most recent publications are “the circulating medium of exchange in colonial pennsylvania  new estimates of monetary composition performance and economic growth” explorations in economic history  oct  pp  and “creating the usdollar currency union  a quest for monetary
