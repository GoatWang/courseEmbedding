a pool of prime fixed rate mortgage loans all but  of the loans are fully amortizing the aggregate pool included loans originated from cole taylor bank  primelending  george mason  and wj bradley

documented loans to borrowers with strong credit profiles low leverage and substantial liquid reserves all but  of the loans are fully amortizing thirdparty loanlevel due diligence was conducted on  of the overall pool and fitch believes the results of the review generally indicate strong underwriting controls originators with limited performance history the majority of the pool was originated by lenders with limited nonagency performance history while the significant contribution of loans from these originators is a concern fitch believes the lack of performance history is partially mitigated by the  thirdparty diligence conducted on these loans that resulted in immaterial findings fitch also considers the credit enhancement ce on this transaction sufficient to mitigate the originator risk geographically diverse pool the collateral pool is geographically diverse the percentage in the top three metropolitan statistical areas msas is  and concentration in california is  which is similar compared to recent semt transactions the agency did not apply a default penalty to the pool due to the low geographic concentration risk transaction provisions enhance performance as in other recent semt transactions rated by fitch semt  contains binding arbitration provisions that may serve to provide timely resolution to representation and warranty disputes in addition all loans that become  days or more delinquent will be reviewed for breaches of representations and warranties rating sensitivities fitchs analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how the ratings would react to steeper market value declines mvds than assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area msa and national levels the implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the surveillance of the transaction fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool the model currently projects sustainable mvds smvds at the msa level for two of the top  regions fitchs shp model does not project declines in home prices these regions are dallasplanoirving in texas  and chicagojolietnaperville in illinois  fitch conducted sensitivity analysis assuming smvds of   and  compared with those projected by fitchs shp model for these regions the sensitivity analysis indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings would react to steeper mvds at the national level the analysis assumes mvds of   and  in addition to the model projected  for this pool the analysis indicates there is some potential rating migration with higher mvds compared with the model projection additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue report sequoia mortgage trust
