costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs these costs which are not reflected in annual portfolio operating expenses or in this example affect the portfolio s performance during the most recent fiscal year the portfolio s turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies to achieve its objectives the portfolio primarily invests in income producing securities such as corporate bonds us government debt securities convertible bonds mortgage and asset backed securities and preferred stocks the various income producing securities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government the portfolio may invest in bonds of any maturity the average maturity and type of bonds in the portfolio change based on the investment adviser s view of market conditions and the likelihood of a change in interest rates for the different types of bonds the portfolio buys typically the portfolio s investments will include us treasuries agencies corporate bonds and high quality mortgage and assetbacked securities the investment adviser believes that having mostly investment grade bonds in the portfolio generally decreases the risk of losing principal and interest however if the investment adviser feels that it can take advantage of higher yields offered by bonds that are not investment grade  junk bonds  the portfolio may invest up to  percent of its assets in such bonds bonds that are not investment grade have a higher risk of losing principal and interest than investment grade bonds the portfolio has adopted a policy to invest under normal circumstances at least  percent of the value of the portfolio s assets in investment grade bonds in addition the portfolio may also invest in securities issued by foreign companies and it may invest in derivative instruments principal risks of investing in the portfolio an investment in the portfolio involves risk including possible loss of the principal amount invested therefore you could lose money by investing in the portfolio the portfolio is subject to the general risk that its investment objective or objectives will not be achieved or that a portfolio manager will make investment decisions or use strategies that do not accomplish their intended goals in addition the principal risks of investing in the portfolio are credit risk the portfolio s investments and particularly investments in convertible securities and fixed income securities may be affected by the creditworthiness of issuers in which the portfolio invests changes in financial strength or perceived financial strength of a company may affect the value of its securities and its ability to make payments of interest and principal and therefore impact the value of the portfolio s shares if it invests in the company s securities further investments in junk bonds are subject to credit risk to a greater degree than higher rated investment grade securities derivatives risk the portfolio s use of derivative instruments may involve risks different from or greater than the risks associated with investing directly in  securities or other traditional investments derivatives may be subject to market risk interest rate risk and credit risk certain derivatives may be illiquid which may reduce the return of the portfolio if it cannot sell or terminate the derivative instrument at an advantageous time or price some derivatives may involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation or the risk that changes in the value of the instrument may not correlate well with the underlying asset rate or index the portfolio could lose the entire amount of its investment in a derivative and in some cases could lose more than the principal amount invested also suitable derivative instruments may not be available in all circumstances and there is no assurance that a portfolio will be able to engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks foreign investment risk the portfolio may invest in securities issued by foreign companies which may pose a greater degree of risk foreign companies may be subject to disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices that are different from those to which us issuers are subject accordingly the portfolio may not have access to adequate or reliable company information in addition political economic and social developments in foreign countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect the operations of foreign companies or the value of their securities risks posed by investing in the securities of foreign issuers may be particularly acute with respect to issuers located in lesser developed emerging market countries high yield risk highyield highrisk bonds also known as junk bonds  have speculative characteristics including particularly high credit risk highyield bonds tend to be less liquid than higherrated securities the liquidity of specific issuers or industries within a particular investment category may be diminished or disappear suddenly and without warning the highyield bond market can experience sudden and sharp price swings and become illiquid due to a variety of factors including changes in economic forecasts stock market activity large sustained sales by major investors a high profile default or a change in the markets psychology interest rate risk since the portfolio invests in fixed income securities changes in interest rates will affect the value of its investments generally inversely with changes in interest rates issuer risk the value of a security may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the general economic or political conditions or to the issuer such as management performance financial leverage operating leverage and reduced demand for the issuer s goods or services manager risk the manager s selection of securities for the portfolio may cause the portfolio to underperform other bond funds or benchmarks market risk the portfolio s net asset value fluctuates in response to securities market movements the portfolio could lose money over short periods due to fluctuation in the portfolio s net asset value in response to shortterm market movements and over longer periods during market downturns securities may decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries represented in the markets the value of a security may decline due to general market conditions economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or to factors that affect a particular industry or industries during a general economic downturn in the securities markets multiple asset classes may be negatively affected mortgage and assetbacked securities risk mortgage and assetbacked securities may decline in value when defaults on the underlying mortgage or assets occur and may exhibit additional volatility in periods of changing interest rates prepayment riskextension risk the portfolio may invest in fixed income securities that may be paid off sooner than expected because borrowers prepaid or refinanced their obligations if there is such a prepayment and interest rates are falling the portfolio may have to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates which may result in a decline in the portfolio s income during periods of rising interest rates borrowers may pay off their obligations in connection with these securities later than expected preventing the portfolio from reinvesting principal proceeds at higher interest rates and resulting in less income than otherwise might be available as well as increasing the exposure of the portfolio to further reductions in the securities values resulting from increases in interest rates style risk if at any time the market does not favor the portfolio s investment style the portfolio s gains may not be as big as or its losses may be bigger than other funds using different investment styles an investment in the portfolio is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency performance information the bar chart and tables below provide some indication of the risks of

of investing in the portfolio an investment in the money market portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency although the portfolio seeks to preserve the value of its investment at  per share it is possible to lose principal by investing in the portfolio additional risks are credit risk the portfolio like all money market portfolios must invest exclusively in high quality debt securities fixed income securities are subject to the risk that the issuer of the security will not repay all or a portion of the principal borrowed and will not make all of the interest payments if the credit quality of a fixedincome security deteriorates below the two highest credit rating categories after the portfolio has purchased the security the portfolio may be required to dispose of the security interest rate risk even with the shortterm investments made by the portfolio there is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the portfolio s investments or cause the portfolio to pay less interest than is currently available from other money market instruments investments in fixed income securities generally will change in value inversely with changes in interest rates however fixed income securities with shorter terms to maturity like those in which the portfolio invests typically

the most recent fiscal year the portfolio s turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies the portfolio primarily invests in equity securities that are selected based on fundamental investment research and longterm growth prospects attractive relative valuations and sensitivity to socially responsible principles the portfolio uses a multicapitalization approach meaning it may invest in companies of any size from large wellestablished companies to smaller companies with market capitalizations below one billion dollars and may change the composition of its investments depending on the outlook for the economic environment and the markets the investment adviser may incorporate technical analysis to assist in the timing of trading decisions the portfolio may also invest in securities issued by foreign companies and it may invest in derivative instruments the portfolio focuses on securities of companies that are sensitive to socially responsible principles although the social criteria for the portfolio are not fundamental and may be changed without the approval of shareholders in particular the portfolio will typically avoid investments in the following types of companies companies that are engaged in the manufacture of tobacco companies that derive a significant portion of their revenues from the manufacture of alcohol companies that are involved in gambling as a primary line of business companies whose activities include direct participation in abortion and companies that derive a significant portion of their revenues from activities that promote pornography in addition to extensive fundamental analysis the investment advisor also uses technical analysis its purpose is not to make investment decisions but rather to assist in the timing of trading decisions principal risks of investing in the portfolio an investment in the portfolio involves risk including possible loss of the principal amount invested therefore you could lose money by investing in the portfolio the portfolio is subject to the general risk that its investment objective or objectives will not be achieved or that a portfolio manager will make investment decisions or use strategies that do not accomplish their intended goals in addition the principal risks of investing in the portfolio are capitalization risk during an overall stock market decline stock prices of small or mediumcapitalization companies often fluctuate more and may fall more than stock prices of largercapitalization companies to the extent that the portfolio invests in stocks of small and mediumcapitalization companies which have sometimes gone through extended periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to largercapitalization companies derivatives risk the portfolio s use of derivative instruments may involve risks different from or greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities or other traditional investments derivatives may be subject to market risk interest rate risk and credit risk certain derivatives may be illiquid which may reduce the return of the

dramatically over the shorter term these movements may result from factors affecting individual companies or from broader influences like changes in interest rates market conditions investor confidence or announcements of economic political or financial information while potentially offering greater opportunities for capital growth than larger more established companies the equities of smaller companies may be particularly volatile especially during periods of economic uncertainty these companies may face less certain growth prospects or depend heavily on a limited line of products and services or the efforts of a small number of key management personnel the portfolio may be particularly subject to the potential risks and volatility of investing in equities socially responsible

value portfolio investment objective seeks to provide longterm capital appreciation the portfolio seeks current investment income as a secondary objective fees and expenses of the portfolio this describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the portfolio the table does not reflect charges and fees associated with a separate account that invests in the

in the portfolio for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  percent return each year and that the portfolio s operating expenses remain the same if separate account andor insurance contract fees and charges were reflected expenses would be higher although your actual costs may be higher or

transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs these costs which are not reflected in annual portfolio operating expenses or in this example affect the portfolio s performance during the most recent fiscal year the portfolio s turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies the value portfolio invests primarily in equity securities selected on the basis of fundamental investment research for their longterm appreciation potential using a bottomup approach the portfolio concentrates on companies which appear undervalued compared to the market and their own historic valuation levels both quantitative and qualitative tools are utilized focusing on a value based equity strategy important valuation criteria include price to sales price to cash flow price to adjusted earnings profitability capital adequacy and growth potential the portfolio also focuses on management ability insider ownership industry position and liquidity of the underlying equity issues in addition to extensive fundamental analysis the investment adviser also uses technical analysis its purpose is not to make investment decisions but rather to assist in the timing of trading decisions the portfolio may also invest in securities issued by foreign companies and it may invest in derivative instruments principal risks of investing in the portfolio an investment in the portfolio involves risk including possible loss of the principal amount invested therefore you could lose money by investing in the portfolio the portfolio is subject to the general risk that its investment objective or objectives will not be achieved or that a portfolio manager will make investment decisions or use strategies that do not accomplish their intended goals in addition the principal risks of investing in the portfolio are capitalization risk during an overall stock market decline stock prices of small or mediumcapitalization companies often fluctuate more and may fall more than stock prices of largercapitalization companies to the  extent that the portfolio invests in small or mediumcapitalization companies stocks of those companies which have sometimes gone through extended periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to largercapitalization companies derivatives risk the portfolio s use of derivative instruments may involve risks different from or greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities or other traditional investments derivatives may be subject to market risk interest rate risk and credit risk certain derivatives may be illiquid which may reduce the return of the portfolio if it cannot sell or terminate the derivative instrument at an advantageous time or price some derivatives may involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation or the risk that changes in the value of the instrument may not correlate well with the underlying asset rate or index the portfolio could lose the entire amount of its investment in a derivative and in some cases could lose more than the principal amount invested also suitable derivative instruments may not be available in all circumstances and there is no assurance that a portfolio will be able to engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks foreign investment risk the portfolio may invest in equity securities issued by foreign companies which may pose a greater degree of risk foreign companies may be subject to disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices that are different from those to which us issuers are subject accordingly the portfolio may not have access to adequate or reliable company information in addition political economic and social developments in foreign countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect the operations of foreign companies or the value of their securities risks posed by investing in the equities of foreign issuers may be particularly acute with respect to issuers located in lesser developed emerging market countries issuer risk the value of a security may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the general economic or political conditions or to the issuer such as management performance financial leverage operating leverage and reduced demand for the issuer s goods or services manager risk the manager s selection of securities for the portfolio may cause the portfolio to underperform other funds or benchmarks market risk although equities historically have outperformed other asset classes over the longterm their prices tend to fluctuate more dramatically over the shorter term these movements may result from factors affecting individual companies or from broader influences like changes in interest rates market conditions investor confidence or announcements of economic political or financial information while potentially offering greater opportunities for capital growth than larger more established companies the equities of smaller companies may be particularly volatile especially during periods of economic uncertainty these companies may face less certain growth prospects or depend heavily on a limited line of products and services or the efforts of a small number of key management personnel the portfolio may be particularly subject to the potential risks and volatility of investing in equities style risk if at any time the market does not favor the portfolio s investment style the portfolio s gains may not be as big as or its losses may be bigger than other equity funds using different investment styles as a category value stocks may underperform growth stocks and the stock market as a whole over any period of time in addition value stocks selected for investment by the portfolio managers may not perform as anticipated because stocks that appear undervalued may remain undervalued indefinitely or may in fact be fairly valued an investment in the portfolio is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency performance information the bar chart and tables below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the value portfolio the bar chart shows changes in the portfolio s performance from year to year for the last ten  years performance numbers shown in the average annual total returns table demonstrate the
