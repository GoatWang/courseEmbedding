me now turn the call over to rich gelfond richard l gelfond thanks jess and thank you all for joining us this morning the third quarter served as another example of the strong demand for imax theaters that weve seen throughout  in the third quarter alone we signed agreements for  new imax theaters most notably our  theater deal with wanda which was the single largest deal in the companys  year history yeartodate we’ve signed agreements for  new theaters which is by far the most we’ve signed in a single year let alone in a ninemonth period in addition to continued signing strength in china we’ve executed a number of agreements with partners in western europe such as kinépolis in belgium cinemark in denmark uci in italy and just a couple weeks ago we announced a five theater deal with pathé which is their second deal with us this year and our largest agreement in france in our history in fact i was in europe last week where i met with senior management of several exhibitors and i was very encouraged by imaxs position in that market overall i think there is a robust opportunity for us in europe the market tends to have strong psas and recent consolidation such as amcs acquisition of odeon and uci could lead to more activity in that market given our record level of signings activity this year our backlog has grown to an alltime high of  theaters at quarter end and is derived from exhibitors in  countries this backlog provides us with an excellent visibility into future installs and when taken together with our exciting existing commercial network of roughly a  theaters means that our footprint should grow to approximately  screens over the next few years that is  larger than it stands today and doesnt include additional theaters that we will sign and install within that period of time our increased level of signings activity over the past year is accomplished by heightened installation activity which as you know is a key driver of our growth in the third quarter we installed  new theaters and now believe we will install between  and  new theaters for the year which exceeds our pace of installations in recent years as we look to  while still early initial indications suggest that installation should be similar to s levels on all we’re very pleased by exhibitor partners desire to not only add additional imax theaters but to get them up and running as quickly as possible with regard to the expansion opportunities i mentioned earlier we’re continuing to make progress all over asia in addition to china countries such as japan are very attractive given the overall opportunity in that market and the success of our partnership with toho which follows our success with many other exhibitors including tokyo another market that im excited about is the middle east with its relative under penetration of imax screens strong psas and growing interest of exhibitors as a matter of fact the number one imax theater in the world for solely magnificent seven and deepwater horizon with the mall of emirates in dubai which recently installed our laser projection system greg why don’t you now take a minute to walk us through the film side of the business greg foster thanks rich and good morning everyone starting with our third quarter box office results we generated a global box office of  million in the quarter resulting in a q psa of  geographically speaking domestic box office grew  to  million primarily led by an  psa growth international exchina and china markets generated psas of  and  respectively it goes without saying there some  that there are some natural variability tied to the box office which is beyond our control however despite the challenging international box office environment in q we have several markets outside of the us perform extremely well including latin america which saw psa group of  yearoveryear latin americas growth was underpinned by strong performance from mexico ecuador and brazil which saw psa group of   and  respectively which is encouraging given the opportunity we see in the region looking at mainland china in a bit more detail our q box office of  million was down roughly  over last year we believe there are few principal reasons for the decline first the rd is depreciated roughly  since q of  therefore on a constant currency basis our q box is down  and yeartodate is up  another factor contributing to the decline is ticket prices our ticket prices similar to the overall industry in china are down  to  since the period a yearago we believe the primary reason is related to discount pricing theater operators tend to offer promotional pricing on newly open theaters of which weve had many recently and lastly theres a ramp up period that takes place for newly open theaters typically it takes a new theater about  months to hit full stride as the theater operator builds awareness and gets the marketing ticketing pricing and everything else right all of these factors contributed to the weaker china box office however we remain bullish on the longterm outlook for china as we believe these factors are cyclical and we will work and we will work  excuse me and will work themselves out over time as the film slate also continues to improve needless to say the second and third quarters of the year overall were sluggish in the box office with that being said its important to remember that the first five months of the year were very strong and came off of  or so months of recordsetting box office in  more importantly box office momentum should begin to build steam once again in the fourth quarter with titles such as the harry potter spinoff fantastic beasts and where to find them the marvel film studio film doctor strange which by the way is premiering tonight at the tcl chinese imax in hollywood and the film doctor strange feature  minutes of specially formatted specially formatted footage for imax and of course rogue one a star wars story we also have some prominent titles playing abroad in the quarter such as zhang yimous the great wall which is releasing in china in middecember these titles should provide us with solid momentum heading into the promising  and  film slates furthermore we recently upped our studio deals with fox and warner bros these along with our existing slate deals with every other major studio provide us with strong visibility into our future slates which again are coming together quite nicely focusing on  for a moment its looking like there should be a major blockbuster virtually every month of the year even better many of these films in fact twice as many as last year will include imax dna having been filled with imax cameras andor utilizing our enhanced imax specific aspect ratios as many of you know we tend to over index on films that are designed specifically for imax looking at next year in more detail there are some fantastic pillar titles and id like to name a few in february we will have the lego batman movie in march we have disneys liveaction beauty and the beast in april we will see the next fast and furious installment fast  in may we have the sequel to guardians of the galaxy in june we’ve wonder woman and the next transformers which will be prominently featured with imax cameras in july we will have spiderman homecoming and christopher nolans new film dunkirk which is materially filmed with imax film cameras and between november and december we’ve the next door the first justice league film and of course star wars episode  clearly theres no shortage of imax centric films next year and of course there will be additional titles added to just what i just mentioned beyond  and   beyond   is also shaping up to be full of tentpole titles we’re still firming up parts of the calendar and have not confirmed all of the following titles i’m going to mention however you can expect to see another year of big blockbuster titles with big major releases which include a jurassic world sequel a predator sequel marvels black panther alita battle angel which is a jim cameron and jon landau production from lightstorm entertainment pac rim  ready player the steven spielberg film the next avengers infinity wars which is being filmed entirely by the russo brothers with imax cameras a star wars the han solo spinoff toy story  warner bros dcs aquaman fantastic beasts  mission impossible  and the avatar sequel to name a few again the anticipated strength of the film slate over the next  months coupled with our quickly expanding network should position us well to take advantage of the years ahead with that i will pass the call back over to rich richard l gelfond thanks greg as we’ve said box office cycles are shortlived and we try to get not so caught up in the monthtomonth or quarter to quarter variability that is inherent in our business so rather than fixate on one metrics i think whats important that we continue to focus on expanding the network improving our technology containing costs and creating exciting experiences for our consumers a pickup in box office will come and based on what greg just discuss it sounds like it should come sooner rather than later id like now to briefly touch on a couple new initiatives outside of our core business and are particularly excited about on our key focuses of mine one is the original content strategy and the other is virtualreality touching first on our content strategy as i mentioned earlier with the commercial network of over  theaters an additional  theaters in backlog we now have critical mass to leverage our distribution platform in more ways than weve done in the past you may recall that we established both the documentary film fund and china film fund to invest in content and are currently exploring new opportunities and partnerships to invest in original content and facilitate its development and release we view this strategy as being a natural evolution to our existing content strategy as this new content would help fill the gaps in our film slate and not disrupt existing windowing patterns we’ve had a lot of interest from filmmakers and a wide array of content creators to partner with us with the draw stemming for our limited release window availability global reach and attractive target demographic for new or less known franchise in particular having imax associated with your content can provide a boost we are in discussions with a number of these content creators regarding the opportunity so stay tuned as i believe we will have more updates on this initiative in the relatively near future the second area of focus is vr as many of  virtual reality as many of you on this call know imax is in a unique business with deep expertise across a number of disciplines on the film side we help capture and remaster content we work with exhibitors to install theaters we are technology producer and integrator and at the heart of it all we’ve a tremendously valuable brand with global recognition the core requirements of launching a locationbased vr experience lineup nicely with our companys core skill sets we’ve studio and filmmaker relationships on the content side capture mechanisms for new content relationships with exhibitors and real estate developers for potential vr sites and a brand that is synonymous with immersive experiences since we announced our vr strategy theres been strong interest for partnerships content deals and many other opportunities and unlike many other vr offerings out there which are targeting the at home experience we’re focused on the locationbased offering which have the ability to provide a broader array of high quality more immersive content experiences with a social element out of the home our national plan is to open our first two pilot locations one in la and the other with odeon in the uk test the concept and assuming this concept works embark on a more aggressive rollout schedule in terms of what the experience will look like the imax vr centers will employ a new modular design proprietary imax that will consist of several vr pods to allow multiple people to engage in the experience so you can go with friends to enjoy the interactive exciting movable vr experiences we expect our initial pilot location in la and the uk to open by yearend with regards to economics we plan to adopt a jv model similar in nature to our cinema business i dont want to get too far ahead of ourselves we continue to be very excited about this initiative i look forward to sharing more about our business after we get our pilot sites up and running i want to underline the word pilot this is a test we are not investing a lot of money at this time in the initiative we are doing a test if the test works we will go forward and i think its a very exciting business for imax and i’m quite optimistic but we’re certainly not getting ahead of ourselves all in all the company is in a very exciting place we’re signing installing theaters at a record pace which positions the core business to take advantage a robust film slate and in addition to the core business we’re in the late stages of launching some exciting new initiatives with that said let me turn the call over to our new chief financial officer patrick mcclymont patrick patrick s mcclymont thank you rich and good morning everyone it’s a pleasure to participate my first earnings call as cfo of imax before diving into the results i thought it might be worthwhile to share some of my initial observations of the company and a few of my areas of focus in the months ahead it goes without saying that imax holds very strong brand equity and generate compelling economics for our exhibitor and studio partners around the world this is evidenced by the impressive network growth during the last several years and more importantly by the record number of theaters in backlog clearly the uptick in signings levels signal ongoing strong network growth for the foreseeable future with continued growth as a backdrop its my goal to ensure the finance department work seamlessly with the various business units so that we can continue to grow quickly efficiently and of course profitably as imax invest in promising new areas of business we will look to be disciplined as we optimize our use of capital focus efforts around cost control and operating leverage and ultimately maximize our returns i believe there is tremendous opportunity to execute the expansion of the core business while also leveraging imaxs brand equity for new areas of growth i’m excited to be a part of this next chapter in imaxs development with that let me review some of the key results within our core business for the third quarter the sustained momentum on the signings front has facilitated a healthy environment for imax theater installations during the quarter we installed a total of  new imax theaters exceeding our q guidance of  theaters and marking a record number of installs for the third quarter as theater operators ramped up ahead of s promising film slate on the new installation  were sales type arrangements  full jvs and nine were hybrid jv arrangements additionally we had two laser upgrades in the quarter as rich mentioned we will likely end up installing between a  and  new theaters this year of the roughly  new theaters expected to install in q we anticipate approximately  to be sales type arrangements  to be full jvs and  to be hybrid jvs moving on to our financial performance our q revenues were  million which resulted in total gross profit of  million or  of revenues which is up from  from q last year our jv and dmr revenues were  million and  million respectively and generated margins of  and  respectively for the jv business its important to note that our margins were diluted slightly by large number of installations completed in the quarter increased jv depreciation expense as our jv network expands and other upfront marketing and commission costs associated with those installs as mentioned previously we installed a total of  full jvs and nine hybrid jvs versus last years  full jvs and eight hybrid jvs in the case of our hybrid jvs we fully expense those system cost during the quarter of installation moving onto opex sga excluding stockbased compensation was  million in the quarter with approximate  related to the new business initiatives for  we expect sga from our core business to be approximate  million in line with  levels sga related to new business initiatives is expected to be approximately  million consistent with last year rd for the quarter was  million which primarily reflects development of our commercial laser product the development of our digital delivery system and costs related to our home initiatives given the accelerated development of our commercial laser product we currently expect core rd expenses of approximate  million in  and rd related to new business investments is expected to be approximately  million in  versus  million last year in total core opex is expected to be approximately  million to  million in  up about  million to  million versus last year opex from new initiatives is expected to be approximately  million for the year essentially in line with  we think its important to look at the core business excluding our new business initiatives to demonstrate the underlying economics of the core remember that these new businesses are still in the investment stage and as such typically have an initial dilutive impact to earnings our adjusted ebitda for q excluding new business and minority interest was  million compared to  million last year resulting in ebitda margins of  in both periods digging a bit deeper our ebitda reduction from new initiatives was  million this year versus  million in q  the total minority interest impact to ebitda was  million and its impact to earnings was  million in the quarter we expect our fullyear minority interest expense as it relates to ebitda to be between  million and  million as a result of weaker box office in china over the last few months the impact to earnings is expected to be between  million and  million adjusted ebitda including new businesses and after minority interest was  million for the quarter down  from the prior year however please take into account that our china ownership has been reduced to  down from  in the third quarter of last year which causes an uneven comparison yearonyear also keep in mind that the fourth quarter will be the first year  the first quarter in which we will have an applestoapples comparison for this metric as minority interest was reduced to  in q  adjusted net profit was  million or  per share in the quarter compared with  million or  per share last year this reflects a third quarter tax rate of  which was higher than last years result of the overall geographic mix of box and installs for the fullyear we now expect our tax rate to be approximately  looking at the balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million of cash on hand this reflects the  million we spent in the quarter repurchasing  imax shares under our existing buyback program through the first nine months of  we’ve spent approximately  million under our buyback program repurchasing more than  million shares we also saw a buildup of inventory as a result of the relatively large number of installs expected in the fourth quarter and the year ahead before i wrap i want to highlight some new things we’re trying out on the ir front we will now be providing weekly box office results on our imax ir web site starting next week our intention is to provide these updates every friday for the prior weeks box office we believe this will increase transparency and help eliminate the guessing game that is required to the analysts and investors given the difficulty in obtaining updated and precise international box office data we’ve also created an ir twitter account under the twitter handle imaxinvestors which will include this box office disclosure as well as other items more relevant to our investor community we will be trying out other disclosure and ir initiatives over time and welcome feedback and ideas from all of you to wrap we’ve a terrific business model and with the existing network growing at a rapid pace we’re wellpositioned to take advantage of the anticipated strength of the upcoming film slates as i mentioned before i think finance is a great role to play as a strategic partner to our business units and im looking forward to being a part of a very exciting time here at imax at this time id like to turn the call over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and your first question comes from stan meyers of piper jaffray please go ahead stan meyers thank you good morning rich i guess congrats on record signings and installs in the quarter i was hoping you can comment a bit more  in a bit more detail on your wanda deal maybe the cadence of installs locations and maybe any other strategic plans with your largest global partner in terms of content or vr richard l gelfond sure so in terms of the signings where they are not all of them have been identified but they pretty much follow a pro rata the patterns of where we are today in china so for example the end of last year about  of our theaters were in tier  cities and our recent installs this year in china were similar with the rest cascading across the other tiers and the new deal as i say its not all identified but its generally across all four tiers of cities and again subject to filling in size and roughly the same ratio going forward the economics of the deal are similar to our existing deal where we are today under that deal and there are nuances so laser is priced differently than xenon but when you kind of step back and look at it its very similar in terms of vr we’re talking to wanda about perhaps doing a pilot location we havent ironed that out yet but wanda has a great interest in vr and its investing resources in looking at it our relationship with wanda continues to be very strong as you know wanda owns amc and our relationship isnt only good with wanda but its good with amc and amc recently bought odeon or it hasn’t closed yet and carmike but in connection with the signing of the odeon deal adam aron the ceo of amc said that they expect it to roll out imax theaters in western europe and odeon in uci locations and we’re advancing those discussions and we’ve terrific relationship with amc and what theyre doing so i think in general stand the relationship with wanda is excellent stan meyers thanks and i had one for greg greg you mentioned few china drivers in the quarter and i was wondering if we’ve seen sort of this step down in pricing and promotion or are we going to see more of these  more of this play out or is this sort of a one step function in q greg foster stan i don’t think you can say its completely over but i do think you can say that it ultimately is contingent on the titles that where there there wasn’t a lot of compelling content particularly imax focused content there was a romantic comedy there were a handful of movies but there was not a breakout movie over the course of the last three to six months in china in fact if you look particularly in the july summer period where in  you had monster hunt there was nothing even remotely close to that this year obviously the slate is it as it moves forward we see some incredible titles for the chinese new year period and by the way we’re evaluating which one of those titles to do they have all been offered to us and we see other titles like the great wall which is going to be a big hit in december in china so its a cyclical process i dont think you can say that its  this is how it is going forward nor do i think you can say its all completely done but i think the content drives a lot of it and the content looks like its promising as we turn the page on this last quarter richard l gelfond so stan the one  just to give you a little more color in china its not the same as the us where the ticket price is fixed from film to film in china they will charge more for a film that has more demand and less for a film that has less demand so following up on what greg said with fast and furious sequel coming out and rogue one and things like that i think it will be our expectation that they would charge higher ticket prices for that and for the content that was around this year stan meyers all right thank you guys operator your next question will come from the line of steven frankel of dougherty markets please go ahead steven frankel good morning first just greg you had a mouthful of figures could you repeat for me what the international exchina psa was and what the china psa was and then i’ve a followup on china greg foster let me get my notes so the international q psa overall was a  geographically speaking  growth in domestic international exchina was  china was    richard l gelfond so its in  accompanying this call are some slides and its on the slide the case you get it didnt get it all that time you could get it there steven frankel great and then as a followup now that you’re been at china for a while and where do you think a normal fullyear psa ends up in china greg foster well i think its largely film dependent as greg just said i think we’ve seen a range last year it was around  million as you know its not only depending on the film its depending on the rmb also this year its significantly less than that my guess is over time that for a normal year it will be somewhere in the middle but we will have to say we are opening an awful lot of theaters as greg said in his script last year we opened at a very rapid pace in fact there was  new theaters that we opened which is a  increase in china and it takes  months for those theaters to ripen more mature so the question is when you say normal i mean do we normal with  growth do we need normal with not a lot of good films do we normal with loss of blockbusters i mean i think it is all those variables but i would say its probably somewhere between last year and this year steven frankel okay and then in terms of japan you’ve made some progress there should we expect another good spate of orders coming from that territory in the coming months richard l gelfond we have an extremely good strong backlog from there so i think you could expect to see installs and the new theaters that have opened especially toho opened two or three this year are doing extremely well there are some things in negotiation but i think there is something like  in backlog that are yet to open so i think youll see the  actually there is  open and i dont remember the backlog number but its somewhere between  and  but i think you will see those roll through over the next year and there is still dialogues going on so we’re optimistic about that steven frankel and on the laser upgrades and installs that you’re doing currently how are the gross margins progressing relative to where you thought they would be by this time patrick s mcclymont i’m sorry could you repeat that steven frankel what are the gross margins like on the laser systems i know they started at a very low gross margin and you had plans to cost them down or to get your gross margins up what happened with that yeartodate patrick s mcclymont i think on the gt laser product that we’re installing now that continues to be an expensive product and has thinner margins in the xenon business rich mentioned in his comments and i mentioned that we’re spending rd dollars right now on a commercial laser product and that is designed to be a broader application it will have margins that are more consistent with the traditional systems steven frankel okay great thank you operator operator instructions and we will go and take our next question from ben mogil of stifel please go ahead benjamin mogil great good morning and thanks for taking my question so greg i wanted to touch a little more about china in your comments around the ticket pricing so certainly i think the comments that you made later on about the market or rich made about the market being sort of one with much more dynamic pricing so good movies pricing moves up and vice versa but when you look at kind of theaters that have been open for more than a year so you of cycle through some of the newness if you will are you  can you maybe talk a little bit what  by what the rmb pricing trends are greg foster well the pricings changed we know that last year there was a proliferation of discount tickets promotional tickets that were offered by the ticket buying services offered in conjunction with the theaters and theres a little bit less of that now so the prices last year were lets say  to  rmb and they’ve gone up in many locations … richard l gelfond in dollars greg foster dollars yes dollars and they’ve gone significantly up this year as the ticket buying discounts have sort of been eliminated in certain places so i think its sort of even now in terms of becoming a little bit more consistent but again these things happen based on the demand of the films so when there is not a lot of demand all of a sudden you see discounts when all of a sudden theres a demand it goes up so thats sort of my answer and i do think its stabilizing and i think as we get into a year that has such incredible brand recognition on titles like furious  etcetera it will be very  it will be a lot more stable benjamin mogil and in general when you say look at a b or c market compared to an a market what’s the ticket price gap just so we can get a sense as you add more and more screens in b and c markets to sort of understand what where sort of the puts and takes you’re almost thinking about the indiscernible retail perspective in terms of stores that you add in sort of second tier markets if you will richard l gelfond again we have theaters across all markets all tiers and theyre not concentrated in tier  as a matter of fact as i said before it is only  of our theaters roughly in tier  markets  in tier   in tier  and  in tier  markets the prices are less variable than you would think and the toptier markets higher about  renminbi for the ticket price but interestingly in two three and four they’re very similar they’re all grouped around rmb benjamin mogil okay and then just on i think your interest on latin america i know brazil has got sort of specific issues given economic growth and the taxation issue but exbrazil maybe you can talk about latina america when you made some positive comments around psas but more onscreen installation sort of activity signings etcetera richard l gelfond so as you know our theaters are doing very well in latam and they’ve been doing better as greg said in his comments and i think our head of sales don savant is pretty enthusiastic about latam and in fact in a earlier draft to our speech we address this question but i’ve just been around too long and the combination of taxes and the currency fluctuations i dont want to go out on a limb maybe the psa growth translates into rapid theater growth but im more cautious about that its certainly a necessary predicate what’s happening but is it sufficient sort of you need more currency stability lets wait and see benjamin mogil that’s great thanks rich thanks greg i appreciate the color operator your next question will come from the line of alexia quadrani of jpmorgan please go ahead alexia quadrani thank you just sort of back on china specifically on the local language down there can you expand a bit on your strategy there you mentioned there are bunch of films coming up and evaluate them sort of film by film is that still the plan kind of sort to take them as they go or do you have a bigger maybe broader commitment to sort of expand your commitment to the local language film and then also you mentioned sort of the new theater conversions are ramping it takes a while before they become really beneficial to the system i guess any sense when you look at  is that still a headwind or does that eventually convert into a tailwind for  greg foster so this is greg i’m going to talk first about the pictures and then rich can talk about the theater growth what we are doing is we’re fully committed to the local language films and we will continue to be and we do so in concert with the hollywood films so during the socalled blackout periods which would be december which would be chinese new year which would be october we tend to have a variety of options to pick from lets talk for instance i’m not going to get into the titles because i don’t want to put anyone in a bad spot but there are been a handful of titles that have been offered to us for the chinese new year and we’re going to pick what we think is the best title in the past we picked a little early often before actually seeing the films and now we put ourselves in a position that we’re able to actually watch the movies before we pick so we will be doing that over the course of the next month or so and i would say in the end of december for the chinese new year title we will announce which one we’re going to do but we will continue to have    local language chinese films throughout the year in the film slate and weve seen great results with many of them some of them are gap fillers and dont do as well like a regular hollywood business but its a big portion of our chinese business and its something that’s also terrific about building up our relationships with chinese filmmakers and studios and we also have an inclination to begin to include imax dna imax cameras into chinese productions to go with our chinese film fund so we’re fully committed to it going forward richard l gelfond so alexia i think its both you ask is it a headwind or a tailwind in the new theaters so tailwind pushing us forward is the network growth and china is extremely rapid i dont remember the exact number but in the fourth quarter there is a lot of installs going on back end loaded now in china and then for next year as i said the install guidance has picked up worldwide and a lot of those are coming out of china so when you look at it as a percentage again you know this is rough so every disclaimer at the beginning calls here but i think that we’re looking at a post  network growth in china again next year and even higher if you look at the quarter so yes its going to take a while for those to mature but on the other hand the  we installed since third quarter last year are going to be open for a year and that will increase how that develops in an equilibrium is a too complex an algorithm for me to do at the moment but i think its both a tailwind and a headwind alexia quadrani and rich you mentioned or you talked a bit about the dynamic pricing in china do you ever see that model or at least for the imax theaters coming here in the us richard l gelfond no its  as i’m sure you know the studios have talked about dynamic pricing for a long time and the exhibitors have discussed as well so for those on the call who arent familiar with the concept it would be when youre showing star wars you charge  more than when youre charging  showing a small romantic comedy but neither the exhibitors nor the studios have really embrace that model in the us but china kind of grew up later as a market and thats not official but its more embedded in the chinese ecosystem alexia quadrani thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of jim goss of barrington research please go ahead james goss thanks first greg congratulations on your promotion to  you are given the board seat greg foster thanks james goss and maybe for you or rich the notion of the programming mix continues to evolve and im wondering if at this stage what you think is the optimal number of films per year and how you allocate these screen time you picked up at least one or two potential or major blockbusters every month in  do you tend to  are you tending to allocate the two weeks or three weeks as an initial thought depending on whether its going to work and then fill it in with a couple of others or you know how is that progressing at this stage greg foster so jim well first of all thanks for indiscernible on the board and secondly we’re trying to show as much flexibility as possible so for instance you recall last year we didnt play the lego movie this year we’ve two lego movies and  on our schedule we often play movies for three or four weeks certainly in the past we did them a lot more frequently that’s come back down a little bit i would say the average movie is probably two weeks but we probably have  not probably we definitely have a lot more oneweek movies than threeweek movies but then when we’ve a title like a star wars or a title like chris nolan movie we’re going to really dig in and play that movie because its innate to our dna so we have to be flexible we will be flexible what we’re not getting to do is come up with sort of these religious statements of we dont do that we’re open for everything we’re open for what we think creates the most compelling content  weeks a year and sometimes it will be one week sometimes it will be two weeks sometimes it will be three weeks and every once in a while it will be four weeks we do this also very much in concert with our exhibitor partners we’re in constant contact with them they certainly have a strong point of view on certain things and we listen to them because they’re our partner we also work with the studio and we also usually tend to honor the relationships and the filmmakers who mean an awful lot to us so theres no hard and fast rule its not as simple as the science theres definitely some variability to it but i would say in general we’re more inclined to play things for two weeks now than we used to which would be three or four james goss okay and with the continued evolution of programming in china are you getting any sense that any of the chinese product could travel well to the united states or are we still not quite there with subtitles or however it would work richard l gelfond i think we are moving in that direction jim i think that that’s certainly the plan when you meet with people who understand kind of the longterm goals of the chinese studios and the government its definitely to become  youre not just to make movies for internal consumption but to make them for export as well and its starting to kind of trickle weve done some of them in imax its early mixed results but i think over time you’re going to see more of that but i dont think that’s an imminent development in the industry q  james goss okay and one final financial sort of thing sales type lease adds  tend to add a penny or something of that nature rule of thumb to eps when you have the hybrid jv type structure does that also have that blended little bit of the jv and therefore that there would also be an initial favorable impact in the quarter when the addition took  takes place greg foster well the hybrid jvs you end up expensing the system cost upfront and then theres the typical sort of installation ramp up expenses so the initial impact is going to be a drag and then you’re sharing in the economics over time so the irr project is quite attractive but the initial upfront is an expense james goss okay okay all right thank you very much operator your next question will come from the line of robert peters of credit suisse please go ahead robert peters great thank you very much for taking my call greg i was wondering you gave us some really great color on the  and  film slate with a number of good hollywood titles coming up but i was wondering when you look at that film slate for china is there any of those hollywood titles that you think will do extremely  do well in those markets for example in the past we’ve seen titles like fast  do extremely well but other titles like star wars havent got it as much attraction i was just wondering if theres anything that jumped to the front of your mind when we look forward to the international film slate greg foster so certainly you’re going to see great results from disney we saw what happened for instance with a title like utopia ph last year where it did such huge business i expect the beauty and the beast will do remarkably well and the animation titles do really well there furious  in going to be giant furious  was a massive title there and i think that the pentup interest in seeing that movie in china will be very strong transformers has china dna in it for several titles now that until recently was the highest grossing hollywood title in all of china so i’ve no doubt that will do remarkably well i think guardians will do well also theres just so many of them spiderman has tended to do particularly well in china and then i think there are titles that are coproductions if you will so for instance the great wall i am confident that the great wall in china in particular will do very very well so i dont think there is going to be a shortage of high performing titles over the course of the next  months and there is often other ones that come out that surprise you for instance in june and who knows if its getting in i’m sure it will but theres the kingsman that’s coming out from fox and the kingsman last year the original one that’s kingsman  did great business in china by the way theres also movies like despicable me  that are coming out so theres  i can just keep going down the list theres quite a lot to choose from and i would anticipate that  has some more traditional home runs than  has had robert peters perfect and maybe just a followup on that if we look at the quota i believe the next round of wto negotiations is starting in  i’m just wondering if you guys could share any thoughts you might have on the current quota system and kind of where you see that going over the longterm richard l gelfond there are a number of open issues between china and the us in terms of film distribution in china i will name three of the major ones there are more than that but three of the major ones one is as you say the quota another one is the city of indiscernible and another is the distribution pattern being dominated by china film group and i think those are the primary issues for discussion and the talks in  i dont think that all three of those are going to break one way or the other but i think there will be some adjustments as a whole that will probably  whats the word i’m looking for probably be favorable to the hollywood community but how that gets divided up and which ones they are  they dont know and we dont know yet robert peters fantastic thanks rich and maybe just one last question then i will pass the line when you’re looking at obviously increasing your film count and offered more international titles and being flexible wondering if you could just talk about any trends you’re seeing in dmr costs on a per title basis do you see that going up over time or is there some way you can look to improve that process and reduce the cost richard l gelfond they’re definitely coming down you have to remember that there are certain titles for particularly if we have cameras in use or aspect ratio were going to surround that movie and make sure that its done with multiple passes to ensure that its the best version of the imax experience but for instance doing an animated title tends to be a little less expensive than doing a live action title and its not something that were not cutting the cost in half but i would say its a    to  reduction and its something that were working on we also have more teams doing it which helps make it more efficient and so we dont have to have as much over time and i think that’s something its very very important and that’s on the actual physical production dmr now part of that is offset by the fact that we’re also contributing more marketing to the titles its very important to us that we make sure that people know that these are imax movies and we work very closely eileen campbell our cmo and her team worked very closely with our studio partners on the marketing side so its a little bit of lower the cost on one end but then add some of it back into the marketing to make sure that people are buying tickets so it works handinhand we’ve also found quite great cooperation with the marketing departments at the studios and with exhibition because of the strength of our slate particularly going forward so its a little bit of take from  some from one hand and move it to  move it to the other robert peters thank you very much operator operator instructions thank you our next question will come from the line of aravinda galappatthige of canaccord genuity please go ahead aravinda galappatthige good morning thanks for taking my question rich i was wondering if you can just touch on the buybacks obviously  million is pretty sizable but we’ve seen the buyback that have ease a little bit as we get into q so given the balance sheet and the fact that arguably this is not responding as well as we would like given to the strong signings maybe just touch on your thoughts going forward about maintaining that momentum richard l gelfond so as we said at the beginning we thought the stock was a good investment we thought that we were going to be opportunistic is what we said and i think we follow through on that aravinda we’ve our plan is  million that was voted in by the board patrick is looking for the number but we bought in a hundred this year and we bought in some more than that last year patrick s mcclymont about a  little bit less than  all in richard l gelfond  all in so we told you what we were going to do we are on the road to doing what we are going to do and then i think we evaluate it as i said earlier with vr and our content strategy we’re not really using a lot of cash right now however should we get convinced that those are good initiatives with good irrs i think we  just like on our jvs i think we would use cash at that point so i think given that we still have room under our existing board program its too early to discuss what we will do after that aravinda galappatthige great thank you rich operator our next question will come from the line of darren aftahi of roth please go ahead darren aftahi good morning thanks for taking my questions just couple if i may if you exclude wanda to your signings this year are you kind of look at  kind of the outlook going  months forward what’s your kind of sense on the cadence of the theater signings and secondarily on your warner bros indiscernible deal any material change on the dmr fees thanks richard l gelfond no material change on the dmr fees going forward we do have different discussions with the studios about marketing support and i think as we go forward they are certainly encouraging us to do more of that and spend more on the movies and as greg just said we are doing that in terms of signings if you exclude the wanda deal which i don’t know why you would but happy to do the hypothetical so its  less  which is  which still beats last year and still beats most years and we have a quarter to go so i’m feeling really good about sizes lots of activity around the world even excluding the wanda deal by the way by way of color in my remarks i talked a little bit about europe but france is a territory that’s been relatively slow to develop but pathé has had tremendous results from the theaters they open especially other two laser theaters and that led directly to the new deal in belgium i’m excited about opening our first theater with kinépolis in japan the results have been extremely good and yet you have to remember thats with a stronger us dollar so its translating in ways that less than what it would translated a yearago but frances psas were up  in the third quarter and as greg mentioned latin america is doing very well so its not just the china story but the china story is a pretty good one darren aftahi thanks operator our next question comes from the line of eric wold of b riley please go ahead eric wold thanks good morning question i’ve i guess on virtualreality i know its early rich and you mentioned in the beginning that you’re kind of focus that model similar to the jv model here i guess one is that kind of the sole focus of that or is it a situation where we could see depending on the market and the partner kind of a threepronged strategy like we have with the core cinema turning to an upfront hybrid and then jv and then second part on content  as you think about the content deals that you would be striking for those vr experiences and kind of competition at home with gaming etcetera what you envision the split to be in terms of exclusive content like maybe youre the only place you can fly the millennium falcon for star wars and lucas and all that versus maybe more generic vr content deal otherwise that are nonexclusive richard l gelfond so eric you know our business very well so i think even though in the shortterm we are doing jvs in the longterm i wouldn’t exclude it evolving in virtual reality the way you suggest so again today we wont do jvs in russia because of transparency and political risk and things like that if we go into russia i would expect we would follow a similar model and we think this is a very huge opportunity and there are  if we could do a big deal where someone wanted to own and operate a number of them and give us a really good margin i think we would be very open to doing that also but our preferred way of going is going to be the jv and we think especially early on we are going to create a terrific product with our great brand that people are going to want and we’re going to drive it to the jv model but we’re openminded in terms of content i think it will follow similar to the way the industry works now so i think content will go through windows so that will be vr content so the first window would probably be imax locationbased entertainment and maybe certainly eventually there will be others that evolve out of home that i think theyll cascade into other windows including inhome windows earlier in the game i think there will be opportunities to have exclusive imax vr windows and we’re looking at bringing in different financing partners so maybe do that where we could profit on both the content side and the distribution side but i think its going to be a developing market and its just a guess but my guess is it will develop consistent with the way the cinema market develop eric wold thank you operator our next question comes from the line of eric handler of mkm partners please go ahead richard l gelfond so this is our last question this is our last question so go ahead eric eric handler all right thanks for getting me under the wire rich your install outlook for next year i thought was great and probably better than most people had anticipated in their models and when you combine that with on paper what looks to be a very good film slate the revenue outlook for the company has the potential to be very strong next year my question is when you look at your expenses are you committed to allow for margins to expand to a level of at least you know that    range that you  weve seen over the last several years or maybe even getting closer to  richard l gelfond so eric as you know because you know us very well we dont look at it that way as targeting a target margin we do have a lot of installs next year on the outlook but you have to be clear a lot of them are jv install so its not going to be kind of onetime revenues coming in so you’ve got to account for that expenses were always focused on the margins and if you saw our sga growth this year was in line for the core business or maybe better than we thought it would be going in to the year however following up on the last question by the other eric we’re obviously trying to do grow our business in different ways too so i think as you look at the business and you separate it were going to try and be a little more transparent on this going forward when you look at the core business i think we’re very focused on the operating margins and we are very focused on improving them that doesn’t mean we’re not going to invest in other businesses that we think show promise and as i said earlier we are not going to invest a lot of money but we’re going to dabble until we see if they work and if they work we are going to invest more money so it depends how you look at i think probably analysts as insightful as you are we will be able to understand that the core business margins are expanding and we’re investing them in the new business now you’re going to have to make a judgment as they come together whether those are good businesses and we know were doing how we should spend more or they’re not i’m sorry i know that was a rather long answer but the short answer is we’re very focused on margin so thats a good point to kind of conclude the call you know as we said during the call kind of my two sentence summary is if youre a longterm investor in imax and you look at longterm success the things like network growth its things like psas and new territories its things like backlog its things like what other opportunities were looking at unfortunately from a box office point of view it wasnt one of the best quarters ever but we think box office tends to be ephemeral so hopefully next  on our next call after rogue one and after fantastic beast and doctor strange and the  slate we will see our longterm strategy come into financial focus so thank you all very much operator ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions id like to hand it back over to your speakers for closing and this
