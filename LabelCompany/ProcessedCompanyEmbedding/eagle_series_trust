objective the technology fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in equity securities of companies that rely extensively on technology in their processes products or services or may be expected to benefit from technological advances and improvements in industry manufacturing and commerce special emphasis may be given to companies employing innovative technology to enhance distribution systems develop new products and increase management efficiencies the fund invests in various technology subsectors including personal computer hardware and software enterprise hardware and software data networking telecommunications internet and electronic commerce semiconductors semiconductor equipment computerbusiness services contract manufacturing and component distribution the funds portfolio manager will use a bottomup method of analysis based on fundamental research to select companies for the funds portfolio in selecting investments the funds portfolio manager will search for companies regardless of size whose stocks appear to be trading below their true value the fund also will invest in companies that are positioned for accelerated growth or higher earnings the portfolio manager may sell any security in the funds portfolio if the companys fundamentals deteriorate the competitive landscape of the company or its industry changes the companys position size in the funds portfolio becomes too large or new investments are more attractive the fund will invest under normal market conditions at least  of its total assets in equity securities of companies that rely extensively on technology in their processes products or services or may be expected to benefit from technological advances and improvements in industry manufacturing and commerce equity securities include common and preferred stocks warrants or rights exercisable into common or preferred stock securities convertible into common or preferred stock and american depository receipts as a temporary defensive measure because of market economic or other conditions the fund may invest up to  of its assets in highquality shortterm debt instruments to the extent that the fund invokes this strategy its ability to achieve its investment objective may be affected adversely what are the main components of the risks of investing in the technology fund perhaps the biggest risk of investing in this fund is that its returns will fluctuate and you could lose money this fund invests primarily in the equity securities of companies whose value might decrease in response to the activities of the company that issued the securities general market conditions andor economic conditions if this occurs the funds net asset value also may decrease investing in a single sector the fund concentrates its investments in the technology sector as a result the funds investments likely will be sensitive to sectorwide conditions adverse conditions or developments affecting one technology subsector may spread to other companies within related technology subsectors the market prices of companies within these subsectors may move in tandem which may cause greater volatility on the funds net asset value and performance than on a fund that invests among different and unrelated sectors investing in technology companies investments in technology companies present special and significant risks for example if technology continues to advance at an accelerated rate and the number of companies and product offerings continues to expand increasingly aggressive pricing may affect the profitability of companies in which the fund invests in addition because of the rapid pace of technological development products and services produced by companies in which the fund invests may become obsolete or have relatively short product cycles as a result the funds returns may be considerably more volatile than the returns of other mutual funds that do not invest in similarly related companies prospectus  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th investing in smallcap companies the fund may invest a portion of its assets in smallcapitalization technology companies small cap companies often have narrower markets and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger more established companies as a result their performance can be more volatile and they face greater risk of business failure which could increase the volatility of the funds portfolio generally the smaller the company size the greater these risks interest rate risk a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector those technology companies having high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors which may cause sharp decreases in the companies market prices further those technology companies seeking to finance their expansion would have increased borrowing costs which may negatively impact their earnings in addition a rise in interest rates typically will cause the market value of any fixedincome securities held by the fund to fall consequently in a rising interest rate environment the funds performance may be reduced investing in illiquid securities because technology securities may be volatile there is the possbility that the technology securities in which the fund invests may become illiquid illiquid securities may trade at a discount when compared to more liquid investments the fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities in a timely manner or at a fair price due to the lack of liquidity in addition the sale of such securities may require more time and increased selling expenses consequently the funds investments in illiquid securities may have an adverse impact on its net asset value nondiversification risk the fund is nondiversified which means it invests in a limited number of companies consequently the performance of any one company may have a substantial impact on the funds performance in addition the funds net asset value may fluctuate more than a fund investing in a larger number of companies portfolio turnover the fund may engage in shortterm transactions under various market conditions to a greater extent than certain other mutual funds with similar investment objectives the portfolio manager expects that the funds portfolio turnover will exceed  the funds turnover rate may vary greatly from year to year or during periods within a year a high rate of portfolio turnover generally leads to greater transaction costs and may result in additional tax consequences to investors who is the
