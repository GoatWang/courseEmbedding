available dispatched from the uk in  business days when will my order arrive add to basket add to wishlist description its no wonder american higher education is facing a crisis while lowincome students cant find a spot in their local community colleges for lack of funding public fouryear universities are spending staggering sums on luxurious residence halls everbigger football stadiums and obscure research institutes we have cosseted our most advantaged students even as we deny access to the working adults who urgently need higher education to advance their careers and our economy in changeedu rebooting for the new talent economy andrew s rosen clearly and entertainingly details how far the american higher education system has strayed from the goals of access quality affordability and accountability that should characterize our system and offers a prescription to restore american educational preeminence to change our system will have to end its reflexive opposition to anything new and different rosen describes how each new wave of innovation and expansion of educational access starting with the founding of harvard in  and continuing with the advent of landgrant colleges in the th century community colleges in the th century and private sector colleges over the last two decadeshas been met with misunderstanding and ridicule when colleges like the university of california cornell and purdue were founded they were scorned as pretenders to the title of university  language that tracks later criticisms of community colleges and most recently forprofit colleges avoiding that condescension is just one of the reasons colleges have come under the sway of harvard envy  schools that were founded to expand access feel an inexorable tug to become more prestigious and exclusive even worse the competition for the best students has led universities to turn themselves into fullfledged resorts theyve built climbing walls french bistros and person hottubs to entice students to their campuses how can america address an incentive system in higher education that is mismatched to the challenges of the years ahead in changeedu rosen outlines seven certainties of education in the coming  years and presents an imperative for how our system must prepare for the coming changes he proposes a new playbook for dealing with the change ahead one that will enable american higher education to regain its global primacy and be a catalyst for economic growth in the st centuryshow more product details format paperback   pages dimensions  x  x mm  g publication date

colleges and universities and the benefits of the fastgrowing privatesector collegeswhile this book will not quiet all the critics it effectively identifies weaknesses in both the nonprofit and the public sectors and should stimulate college presidents to reconsider some of their priorities school library journal presently this may be the subject of snide editorials and contemptuous hearings but rosen envisions a day when forprofit learning centers step up and fill the education gap much in the same way land grant and community colleges did in years past the alternative he fears spells trouble for american supremacy in education kirkus reviewsandrew rosen has written a great new book on higher education in america changeedu rebooting for the new talent economy it is provocative
