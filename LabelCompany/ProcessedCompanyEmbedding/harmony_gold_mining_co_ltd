try — tom from concord ca reviews description directions ingredients rated  based on  customer reviews cushings disease cushings disease results from an excess of adrenal gland hormones it is a common sideeffect of drugs such as corticosteroids which are often prescribed to treat canine arthritis allergies and other ailments cushings disease can also result from a benign tumor on one of the adrenal glands or the pituitary gland symptoms of cushings disease include increased thirst and appetite frequent urination loss of hair skin problems panting high blood pressure increased susceptibility to infections if left untreated cushings disease can lead to other conditions like diabetes and heart problems conventional therapies note your dogs cushing’s could be caused by a corticosteroid drug  it may be possible to wean your dog off the drug however this must be performed under professional supervision to avoid complications you can speak to your vet about this corticosteroids sometimes have side effects that are worse than the condition they were used to treat and make your dog more susceptible to bacterial and viral infections every day we get calls from customers looking for an alternative to steroid drugs antineoplastic drugs  during its evaluation as an insecticide a leading antineoplastic drug was discovered to have adrenocorticolytic effects the most obvious and rapid response is a reduction in water intake urine output and appetite which usually occur at the end of the initial course of therapy muscle strength and exercise tolerance improve over the first  weeks skin and hair coat changes take longer and the progress is variable after the first reevaluation rechecks should be scheduled every  months for the rest of the pet’s life to determine whether the dose needs to be adjusted depending on the results of acth response testing overall based on the results of three survival studies the mean survival time of canines with pituitarydependent cushing’s

other steroids the blockade is reversible and appears to be doserelated a word from our veterinarian it is important to note that longterm use of corticosteroid drugs usually prescribed for
