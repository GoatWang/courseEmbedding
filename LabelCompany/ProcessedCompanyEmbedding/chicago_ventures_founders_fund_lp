year after being replaced as ceo of accretive health inc shes raising a  million privateequity fund called chicago pacific founders focused on health care investments its a splashy debut effort in an industry thats attracting lots of interest that land rush may make it harder to produce kingsize returns as investors bid against one another for deals but it also signals the opportunities to be had as a graying population the affordable care act and costcutting pressures reshape roughly a sixth of the entire us economy “there are people with nowhere near the track records of this group who are able to raise funds” says rick herbst who oversees the lifesciences practice at chicagobased sikich llps investment banking unit “there is a lot of competition for deals” ms tolan  spent two decades as an accenture ltd retail consultant and strategist before cofounding accretive in  as a billing consultant to hospitals and physicians groups though she left the company under a cloud—its stock cratered after accretive was accused in  of strongarming patients for bill payments—she seems to have had little trouble assembling an alist of talent for her new venture chicago pacific founders managing partner is larry leisure a former accenture colleague and health care consultant who is an adviser to legendary silicon valley venture fund kleiner perkins caufield  byers in menlo park calif its operating partner is john rijos who previously was chief operating officer of brentwood tennbased brookdale senior living inc one of the nations largest operators of assistedliving facilities ms tolan a trustee of the university of chicagos booth school of business is chairman ms tolan declines interview requests but in a statement she describes chicago pacific founders as “an investment firm based in chicago and san francisco focused on innovative health care services and senior living” investment opportunities according to the linkedin profile of a fund employee include “leading health care providers postacute care nextgeneration health plans eldercare businesses and the technology companies that underpin transformed care adding innovation capital active management and strategic partnering opportunities” its not clear how much money ms tolan and her partners have raised or when they will make their first investment wellworn path ms tolans path to private equity has been wellworn by exceos after chris galvin was forced out as ceo of motorola inc he launched harrison street real estate capital llc in chicago which has raised  billion to invest in real estate including medical offices senior housing student housing and selfstorage glen tullman who quit as ceo of allscripts healthcare solutions corp in  after a fight with his board now invests in health care and education technology through his  wire ventures fund though she left accretive under a cloud she seems to have had little trouble assembling an alist of talent for her new venture “shes a rare health care executive whos worked effectively in a corporate environment and at the same time understands what its like to start a business from scratch” says nina nashif ceo of healthbox llc a chicago incubator for health care startups who calls ms tolan a mentor ms nashif says “thats key” nonetheless ms tolan must prove she can spot potential winners before others do in chicago alone chicago pacific founders could be competing with some of the biggest players in private equity such as gtcr llc as well as flexpoint ford llc water street healthcare partners and roundtable healthcare management inc ms tolan and chicago pacific founders are part of another trend says david loucks ceo of northbrookbased investment banking firm healthios capital markets llc “those funding health care today are different from those who funded it in the past” he says “there are as many family offices funding innovation as institutions individuals like bill gates at the end of the day they want to be known for something more than what theyve already done” ms tolan grew accretive to more than  million in sales and nearly  employees she resigned as chairman in november the company which has said it

fellowship is nurturing local startup founders in industries as diverse as healthcare energy retail and more share related conversations editor pick entrepreneurship my booth polsky center winter  recommended for entrepreneurs tapping into a likeminded community can provide that extra push to keep going that’s precisely the goal of the polsky founders’ fund fellowship or pf at the polsky center for entrepreneurship and innovation where nine entrepreneurs are spending the year growing existing ventures left to right joey dumas gordon taylor rho kook song lance larsen andi hadisutjipto dane guarino austen mance jinjing xia mike pintar and laotu team member dora yao pf now in its first official run serves as a yearlong incubator for chicagobased entrepreneurs providing everything from funding to coworking spaces to quarterly checkins graduating university of chicago students booth students and decelerating booth students can apply for the program here’s a look at the newest fellows current fulltime mba student lance larsen and dane guarino ’ cofounders of markit medical combatting sticker shock after a medical procedure can be difficult so fellows larsen and gaurino created a platform that integrates into the physicianreferral process and lets consumers estimate the costs of their procedures and doctor visits before committing to a certain physician or treatment the founders are marketing the service to insurers eager to help their customers find more transparency when it comes to medical costs in addition to giving them the opportunity to grow their database the fellowship has been a rewarding experience because the pair has been able to further hone their concept said larsen pf “allowed us to run proofofconcept tests before we had insurance companies as customers” he said mike pintar ’ coo of netenergy after years of hardware development the team at netenergy is almost finished with a thermal battery they hope will shave at least  percent off of commercial cooling costs the battery stores cold energy and is similar to an electrical battery during peak energy use—when rates can surge up to six times the offpeak rate—the battery uses stored thermal energy to reduce both costs and carbon emissions said pintar as the team of five works to perfect the battery hardware the fellowship has turned into a community to celebrate both successes and mistakes “we can talk and share war stories” pintar said we were able to bring in an advisor who is a former ridesharing executive which allowed us to understand more about the industry gordon taylor current fulltime mba student andi hadisutjipto founder and ceo of riviter the world of image recognition is expanding quickly applying the latest technology is especially useful for innovative online retailers said hadisutjipto riviter uses a visual search algorithm to improve retailers’ ability to market relevant products to consumers online pf’s quarterly checkins for fellows “have been a great organizing function” hadisutjipto said “these help to keep us accountable to higherlevel goals and get us in the practice of reporting to our investors” current fulltime mba student rho kook song cofounder and ceo of freenters as printing costs at universities grow students have another option freenters works with sponsors to pay college students to print ads along with their documents said kook song the company which has more than  users and is already active on campuses is now moving toward a softwareonly model a transition that’s been helpful to speak about with other fellows with most pf teams located at a coworking space in the city it’s easy to “casually bounce ideas off each other” kook song said “those spontaneous conversations are worth it” austen mance ab ’ founder of enlistics applying analytics to the hiring process can mean huge rewards for businesses looking to find the best employees at enlistics mance helps firms analyze the strengths of sales candidates through their social media data much like creditcard companies check credit scores minimizing the risk for employee turnover the support from polsky has allowed the team of five to attend autoindustry conventions to roll out their services to car dealerships where salesteam turnover remains extremely high mance said polsky helped us to reach out to our base in shenzhen jinjing xia gordon taylor ’ founder of carla even with widely available ridesharing services getting to a largescale event can be a hassle when prices surge and hopes of finding a car wane taylor’s earlystage carpooling startup hopes to address the problem by providing transport to large events such as coachella and burning man or even local football games the platform allows car owners to rent their vehicles for carpooling with their peers while new to the ridesharing space taylor said the fellowship has helped him get better acquainted with the industry “we were able to bring in an advisor who is a former ridesharing executive which allowed us to understand more about the industry” he said joey dumas ’ cofounder and ceo of unmannedkind as drone technology becomes even more sophisticated the regulatory environment becomes more complex dumas a former pilot is hoping to provide advisory services to companies eager to integrate drones into their current airspace and flightplanning systems as well as help in navigating the everchanging regulation landscape for dumas the encouragement and advice from pf fellows who are further along in building their firms is key “as the rest of my classmates are starting to get fulltime jobs and paychecks having that network and cohort is very helpful” he said jinjing xia ma ’ cofounder of laotu with greater focus on the safety of china’s food supply startups including laotu are moving in cofounder xia hopes to build out a platform for rural farmers making ecologically produced products in china that’s because connecting farmers to their urban customer base promotes the kind of “environmental caring” that’s key to sustainable agriculture she said for xia who founded the company last year reaching the user base from chicago’s campus seemed out of reach at first but as a pf fellow xia was able to tap into the booth network in china connecting with experts in agribusiness to get a sense of the market and the needs of consumers “polsky helped us to reach out to our base in shenzhen” xia said —by alina dizik     share
