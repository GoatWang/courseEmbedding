seafood in which william mayer controlled the daily operations and plaintiff was the sole owner and shareholder william mayer was experienced in the seafood business and plaintiff owned a janitorial business which he continued to operate along with wholesale seafood wholesale seafood also employed other sales persons including ralph natale and daniel daidone who according to a certification signed by william mayer are members of the south philadelphia and new jersey mafia wholesale seafood has since gone out of business according to plaintiff he loaned william mayer money on several occasions in amounts ranging from  to 0 in december  plaintiff testified that he wire transferred  payable to william mayer to defendants joint bank account  of which was for a christmas bonus the first transfer was made on december   for  and the second transfer was made on december   for 0 both transfers were made from the bank account of plaintiffs company jc consulting and leasing corporation located in the grand cayman islands plaintiff explained that he opened the account for investment purposes at trial plaintiff testified that he prepared a promissory note memorializing the 0 loan which was signed by william mayer on january   he further testified that he prepared a second document referred to as an addendum personal security note which he contended was signed by both defendants and notarized before a notary public on january   plaintiff testified he never spoke to candice mayer concerning any of the alleged loans he made to william mayer or concerning the signing by her of a promissory note and mortgage plaintiff never asked candice mayer to guarantee any loan to william mayer candice mayer testified she never asked to borrow any money from plaintiff or jc consulting and leasing corporation she never told plaintiff that she would sign a promissory note or mortgage or any other loan document from plaintiff to her husband candice mayer further stated that she has never spoken to plaintiff except briefly at a few social functions after the two wire transfers were made plaintiff testified he requested william mayer to ask candice mayer to guarantee the payment of 0 of the  in wire transfers and that he prepared a second note for william and candice mayers signatures to provide him security for the loans he made to william mayer candice mayer testified that she never signed the second note captioned addendum personal security note nor did she give her husband or anyone else permission to sign her name to the note according to the certification of william mayer which was read to the jury he forged his wifes signature on the note as a result of being threatened with bodily harm by an agent of plaintiff if he failed to obtain his wifes signature on the note and mortgage candice mayer was unaware at the time the addendum personal security note was signed by william mayer that her husband had signed her name to that document michele devery a notary public who plaintiff contended notarized the signatures of both william and candice mayer on the addendum in january  testified that while working at pnc bank she notarized the security agreement she stated that defendants signed the agreement while in her presence however when the court asked devery if she recognized candice mayer as the woman who came into the bank and signed the document devery responded i couldnt tell you the promissory note which was admitted into evidence was dated september   however it was signed on january   the note reflects that the first payment was to be made on october   during crossexamination plaintiff explained that the note predated the december  loans because the promissory note was originally drafted for a previous 0 loan that was paid by william mayer prior to his signing of the note plaintiff stated that he used the old note and handwrote the changes for the subsequent 0 loan on december   a payment in the amount of 0 was made to plaintiff by a check signed by william mayer plaintiff testified that the 0 was for repayment of a september  loan and not the 0  december  loan peter meltzer testified that he assisted plaintiff in attempting to collect the 0 debt owed by william mayer meltzer stated that he discussed the note and its payment with william mayer who never asserted any defenses against the collection of the debt he also testified he never discussed with william mayer the signatures on the note on crossexamination meltzer stated that he had no notations from any conversations he had with william mayer concerning his debt collection efforts plaintiffs counsel introduced a debt collection letter from meltzer dated august   addressed to william and candice mayer which demands the payment of the loan candice mayer denied receiving this letter joseph riga plaintiffs attorney also testified as to his efforts in collecting the debt from defendants riga testified that he filed the initial lawsuit in september  as an attempt to collect the 0 debt he stated that william mayer never asserted any defenses against the collection of the debt during crossexamination riga testified that in december  once execution efforts against the defendants home were commenced candice mayer contacted him explaining that her purported signature on the security agreement was not her signature he stated that she implied her signature on the security agreement was a forgery candice mayer submitted exemplars of her actual signature on various official documents candice mayer admitted that  in two checks was deposited into the mayers joint checking account in december  she testified that when she became aware of the transfers her husband explained that it was his christmas bonus from plaintiff immediately after the funds were deposited candice mayer began writing checks to pay various credit card bills however a few days later she was informed by her husband that the money was not a christmas bonus and that plaintiff was upset that defendants were spending the money william mayer then wrote a check for 0 to plaintiff from the wire transfer money five or six days later he wrote a second check for 0 but the check bounced she testified that she spent approximately  of the wire transfer money for household expenses she believed the  was her husbands christmas bonus candice mayer also testified that her husband told her he signed the promissory note however she never signed it she also denied that she appeared before devery to have her signature notarized she stated that she only knew devery because deverys husband was an employee of wholesale seafood she also stated that she refused to sign the 0 note when asked by her husband to sign it because plaintiff had already been paid a check for 0 at the close of defendants case the trial judge ruled that those paragraphs of william mayers certification that complied with njre b and b would be permitted to be read to the jury by defense counsel defense counsel read the following redacted certification i william mayer do hereby certify as follows then i had inadvertently become indebted to clement r hipple in the amount of  the way that happened was that wholesale seafood inc had initially been profitable and had just completed the successful christmas and new years most of the key employees at wholesale seafood inc had received cash bonuses i did not receive a cash bonus however plaintiff hipple did state to me that he was very happy with the job i was doing for the company and that he would see to it that i was quote taken care of end quote or words to that effect shortly thereafter plaintiff hipple wired the sum of  into my bank account from an account which he had i believe in the cayman islands    based upon the cash bonuses which the other employees had received and my previous discussions with plaintiff hipple i assumed that the money was my overdue christmas bonus i quickly spent the money only to find out a very short time later that plaintiff hipple was using my account to send money to himself in order to avoid banking regulations and the internal revenue service scrutiny when plaintiff hipple asked about the money he was  he wired to my account i explained to him that i had assumed it was my christmas bonus and that i had spent most of it plaintiff hipple was not very happy that i had spent a lot of the money that he had wired into my account    eventually at some point plaintiff hipple sent ralph natales driver anthony vesta to see me     ralph natale was an employee of wholesale seafood therefore at the insistence of ralph natales driver that would be anthony vesta at the behest of plaintiff hipple i agreed to sign a promissory note in the amount of 0 for the  which i had quote borrowed from the plaintiff hipple ralph natales driver anthony vesta also indicated that plaintiff hipple was insisting that my wife and i sign a mortgage on our home to secure the note    i subsequently met ralph natales driver at the dennys restaurant where i signed the promissory note and mortgage my wife defendant candice mayer was supposed to be there also but she was not i told ralph natales driver that she had refused to sign the mortgage actually i had not told my wife the extent of my problems and about the danger that i thought it was  that i was in because i did not want her to worry about me     when i told ralph natales driver that was anthony vesta that my wife had refused to sign the mortgage he initially became very angry then he calmed down and seemed as if he were concerned for me he explained to me that he was looking out for me and trying to keep hipple from turning in  this into a quote mob situation end quote he explained to me that if my wife would not sign the mortgage i would have to sign her name in order that he could report back to hipple that everything has been taken care of initially i refused to sign my wifes name however when ralph natales driver told me that if i were lucky they would just break my legs i agreed to sign my    wifes name to the mortgage all right on more than one occasion plaintiff hipple sent me to meet with ralph natale at restaurant and this restaurant and that and i should call the people he had spoken with and arrange for delivery of seafood sometime after wholesale seafood inc closed and after i had signed the 0 promissory note and mortgage plaintiff hipple stated to me that there was money missing from the business and that he thought that i was responsible in response to that i told hipple that i never handled the money at any time and that if there was in fact money missing that he should take  he should take a look at the people who handled the money at wholesale seafood inc those persons included greg johnson plaintiff hipple continued to accuse me of stealing money from wholesale seafood inc eventually plaintiff hipple offered me a simple choice i could either sign a promissory note in the amount of  which amount was to include the debt on the previous promissory note which hipple had obtained or i could have this turned into a quote mob situation end quote i chose to sign the note rather than assume the risk that plaintiff would make good on his threat as respects the addendum defense counsel read the following from william mayers certification in the document entitled addendum personal security note which document as i understand it and as it was intended by the plaintiff is a mortgage on  spring mill drive sewell new jersey 0 the  spring mill drive sewell new jersey property is my residence and home which i own together with my wife defendant candice mayer as set forth hereinabove after signing the 0 note i was not able to make payments on it and plaintiff brought suit against me and my wife thereafter i paid the plaintiff the total of 0 toward the debt and thats all the jury was charged as to each defendant separately as to the estate of william mayer the jury was asked whether william mayer was liable to plaintiff on the loan and in what amount as to candice mayer the jury was asked whether she was liable on the 0 loan and if so in what amount if the jury found she were not liable on the loan the jury was asked whether candice mayer ratified the personal security note and in what amount or in the alternative whether she was unjustly enriched when she received the wire transfer sums in december  finally the jury was instructed as to defendants counterclaim for 0 the questions of ratification and unjust enrichment were submitted to the jury as a result of the court granting plaintiffs motion at the end of all the evidence to amend the complaint to conform to the evidence by adding a claim for unjust enrichment the court granted the amendment as to candice mayer over defendants objection on february   the jury returned its verdict the jury found that the estate of william mayer was liable to plaintiff for the original 0 loan but that candice mayer was not liable on the loan the jury however found that she ratified the loan but no amount was awarded to plaintiff on this claim however the jury found unjust enrichment as to candice mayer and awarded plaintiff 0 as damages against her defendants counterclaim was rejected by the jury candice mayer presents the following arguments for our consideration point i the jury returned an unsupported inconsistent and unsustainable verdict with respect to defendant candice mayer a the trial court should not have permitted an amendment to the complaint to assert a claim for unjust enrichment and plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie case for that claim and it should not have gone to the jury b the verdict against defendant william mayer on the contract claim requires that judgment against defendant candice mayer on the claim for unjust enrichment be reversed plaintiff presents the following argument for our consideration the trial court should not have vacated hipples  judgment nearly four and onehalf years later ii we will first address the issue raised by plaintiff on his crossappeal plaintiff contends the trial court erred in vacating the  default judgment entered against both defendants although defendants march   motion to vacate default judgment did not refer to any specific subsection of rule 0 the oral argument advanced by defendants counsel suggested his application was brought under subsection c fraud whether    intrinsic or extrinsic misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party defendants motion was filed march   nearly four and onehalf years after default judgment was entered on december   and served on defendants on january   plaintiff contends the motion brought under subsection c of rule 0 was time barred by rule 0 because it was brought more than one year after the judgment was entered plaintiff claims the trial court lacked the discretion to modify or ignore the specific time limitation set forth in rule 0 defendants counsel filed the detailed certification of william mayer which we have recited in this opinion in support of defendants motion to vacate default judgment against them additionally the judge heard testimony from william mayer in support of the motion william mayer asserted that the note upon which plaintiff obtained default judgment was obtained by extortion ie he was coerced by a threat of physical violence directed against him from an agent of plaintiff with ties to the mafia into signing the note sued upon by plaintiff and in forging his wifes signature on the addendum note see njsa c0 only the jailing of the agent of plaintiff who extorted his signature and his forgery of his wifes signature and plaintiffs obtaining of a writ of execution on defendants home caused defendants belatedly to move to vacate default judgment the judge without reference to a specific subsection of rule 0 implicitly determined that defendants had shown excusable neglect and a potential meritorious defense and granted defendants motion to vacate for reasons of justice conditioned on defendants payment of a  counsel fee to plaintiffs counsel we are convinced from our review of the record that the judge construed defendants motion as being brought under rule 0f any other reason justifying relief from the    judgment based on a finding of exceptional circumstances or under rule 0 based upon a finding of fraud on the court the judge specifically required the testimony of william mayer as back ground information as to why defendants think theres been a fraud created on the court the court in granting defendants motion rhetorically asked why wouldnt i allow him to reopen if the alleged constitutes a meritorious defense hes alleging he was threatened    your saying that your signature was forged    the issue here is under rule 0 to do justice as i recollect that rule    i view that there is potentially meritorious defense    and in the interest of justice that is how i see justice although rule 0 provides that a motion to set aside a judgment for reasons of exceptional circumstances under rule 0f must be made within a reasonable time there is no time limit imposed by rule 0 upon the power of a court to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court see tara enters inc v daribar mgmt corp  nj super   app div  hyland v kirkman  nj super   ch div  an application to vacate a default judgment is viewed with great liberality and every reasonable ground for indulgence is tolerated to the end that a just result is reached marder v realty constr co  nj super   app div affd  nj 0  see also rule 0 nevertheless a default judgment will not be disturbed unless the failure to answer or otherwise appear and defend was excusable under the circumstances and unless the defendant has a meritorious defense either to the cause of action itself or if liability is not disputed to the quantum of damages assessed pressler current nj court rules comment  on r 0  in marder supra  nj super at  we held that a reopening of the judgment for purposes of assessing damages is proper where the defendant provides a reasonable assertion to the effect that it is not liable for the amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff in this case defendants motion was filed to vacate a default judgment that was entered on december   the trial court granted defendants motion pursuant to rule 0 we review the trial courts granting of a motion to vacate default judgment on abuse of discretion grounds we are satisfied based on the reasons set forth by the judge on the record that the courts decision was in accord with marder supra  nj super at  and the courts broad discretion to grant relief under rule 0 the judge was concerned with candice mayers rights due to the testimony by william mayer that he was forced to forge his wifes signature the judge explained im more concerned about the misses rights    i have no idea    whether he did or didnt forge her signature that will have to be established by a bona fide process we are convinced that the certification of william mayer in support of defendants motion to vacate default judgment which contained allegations of extortion to obtain signatures on a note if true and if known to plaintiff when the default judgment was obtained would qualify as constituting a fraud on the court the assertions contained in william mayers certification would likewise support relief from the judgment under rule 0f that subsection provides for relief in exceptional circumstances and in such exceptional cases its boundaries are as expansive as the need to achieve equity and justice court invest co v perillo  nj    we are satisfied given the certification before the court that the judge based upon his broad power in the exercise of discretion properly permitted the vacation of default judgment notwithstanding the defendants four and onehalf year delay in seeking relief from the judgment iii candice mayer asserts that the trial court erred when it granted plaintiffs motion made at the conclusion of all the evidence to amend the pleadings to conform with the evidence by adding a count of unjust enrichment against her defendant acknowledges that a claim for unjust enrichment against candice mayer was not alleged in his complaint he contends however that such a claim was not originally pleaded because candice mayer never disavowed her signature on the note or her obligation on the loan until several years after the collection suit was filed once candice mayer advanced her claim of forgery her benefit from the use of the loan proceeds became an issue in the case a motion for leave to amend to conform to the evidence is to be liberally construed r  it is generally a matter left to the trial judges sound discretion in the interests of justice new mea constr corp v harper 0 nj super   app div  our review of the record convinces us however that the court mistakenly exercised its discretion when it submitted the claim of unjust enrichment to the jury because plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie case in support of the claim one of the elements that a plaintiff must prove to make out a claim for unjust enrichment is that the plaintiff expected remuneration from the defendant at the time plaintiff performed or conferred a benefit on defendant vrg corp v gkn realty corp  nj    additionally the doctrine of unjust enrichment rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly at the expense of another associates commercial corp v wallia  nj super   app div  to recover under this doctrine plaintiff must prove that the defendant received a benefit and that retention of that benefit without payment therefor would be unjust ibid quoting callano v oakwood park homes corp  nj super 0 0 app div  a common thread running through the successful invocation of a claim of unjust enrichment is that the plaintiff expected remuneration from the defendant or if the true facts were known to plaintiff he would have expected remuneration from defendant at the time the benefit was conferred id at  quoting callano supra  nj super at 0 there was no evidence adduced at the trial that would support a contention by plaintiff that he expected candice mayer to repay or guarantee the loan at the time it was made plaintiff did not testify that at the time of either wire transfer he expected candice mayer to repay or guarantee repayment of the loan indeed the wire transfer was to the order of william mayer alone nor is there any testimony or documentary evidence that would support such a contention the wire transfers took place on december   and december   the promissory note that evidences the loan was not signed until january   the addendum personal security note was signed on the same date according to the testimony of plaintiff he did not give the promissory note and addendum personal security note to william mayer until after the wire transfers thus the very first time that the issue of candice mayer being responsible for repayment of or guaranteeing the loan was raised was after the loan had been made moreover even if plaintiff had testified that at the time of the wire transfers he had an expectation of candice mayer becoming obligated on the loan or guaranteeing it the facts simply would not support any such expectation the loan documents clearly show that any loan was made to william mayer alone by plaintiffs own account william mayer requested the alleged loan by plaintiffs own testimony and the express terms of the addendum personal security note it was intended to secure the loan to william mayer by creating a lien upon the home of the defendants it is undisputed that candice mayer never asked to borrow any money from plaintiff or jc consulting and leasing corporation nor did plaintiff ever ask candice mayer to guarantee any loans to her husband candice mayer never told plaintiff that she would guarantee any loans made to her husband there was no testimony that william mayer ever told plaintiff that candice mayer had agreed to become obligated on or to guarantee the loan either prior to or at the time it was made since plaintiff never spoke to candice mayer concerning the alleged loan and since william mayer had never represented to plaintiff that he had spoken to his wife about the alleged loan plaintiff could not have had any expectation concerning the willingness of candice mayer to become obligated on or to guarantee the loan unless and until such time as she actually signed the addendum personal security note another element that plaintiff was required to prove with respect to his claim of unjust enrichment was that candice mayer actually received a benefit and that retention of that benefit without payment would be unjust vrg corp supra  nj at  those elements are largely indistinguishable from the question of to whom the loan was made since the undisputed evidence shows that the loan was made only to william mayer only william mayer received the benefit of that loan the fact that candice mayer had access to the defendants joint checking account and spent some of the proceeds of the loan to reduce household credit card debt is not evidence that candice mayer was unjustly enriched if plaintiff had known that candice mayer neither signed the note nor authorized her signature and that she had no knowledge of the forgery of her signature he would not have expected remuneration from her when he made the loan to william mayer via wire transfers payable to william mayer plaintiffs argument focuses upon the proceeds of the loan as opposed to the loan itself however even when the unjust enrichment claim is analyzed from this perspective it is clear that there is no competent evidence that candice mayer was unjustly enriched according to the testimony of plaintiff the two wire transfers totaling  constituted a 0 loan to william mayer with the remaining  being a christmas bonus for william mayer on december   william mayer paid back to plaintiff 0 of the  that plaintiff had just wired to him on december   according to plaintiff the 0 payment represented the repayment of a previous loan that he had made to william mayer in september  plaintiff testified william mayer was    paying me back with my own money since the alleged september loan of 0 was only to william mayer no claim of unjust enrichment against candice mayer could attach to that 0 that left only a balance of 0 to which a claim of unjust enrichment could theoretically be asserted candice mayer testified that she continued to use the joint account after the proceeds of the loan were deposited into their joint account she stated that she wrote checks totaling approximately  from the proceeds of the wire transfers none of the checks that she wrote from the proceeds of the wire transfers were offered or admitted into evidence candice mayer was never asked to identify who the payees were on any of the checks that she wrote she was not asked if the checks represented payments of her debts the debts of william mayer or joint debts they were simply identified as household debts the doctrine of unjust enrichment requires plaintiff to prove that candice mayer received a benefit to which she was not entitled therefore it was the burden of plaintiff to prove that a portion of the loan proceeds were used to pay obligations of candice mayer she may well have written checks totaling approximately  to pay joint credit card debt or to pay obligations of william mayer whose obligations were satisfied by the checks written by candice mayer from the proceeds of the wire transfers simply cannot be determined based upon the evidence thus plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof we are convinced that accepting all of the testimony and evidence submitted by plaintiff in the light most favorable to plaintiff that the evidence adduced did not support the submission to the jury of the doctrine of unjust enrichment plaintiff could not have expected based on these facts remuneration from the defendant any mistake by plaintiff as to the validity of the purported signature of candice mayer on the addendum note did not result from any action of candice mayer as she had no expectation that there was reliance by plaintiff on her signature when in fact it had been forged by her husband without her knowledge the fact that loan proceeds are deposited into a joint checking account on which both spouses customarily write checks does not in and of itself in our view support a finding that the innocent spouse was unjustly enriched if the spouse does not fulfill an obligation that he or she knew nothing about because we are convinced that the elements necessary to support a claim for unjust enrichment were not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record we reverse the judgment against candice mayer rova farms resort inc v investors ins co of am  nj    reversed on the appeal affirmed on the crossappeal   william mayer died prior
