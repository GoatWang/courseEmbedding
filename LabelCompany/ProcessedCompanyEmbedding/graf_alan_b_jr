   cfo magazine share tweet email print  print  email this article to please enter your email address subject comments memphis in early august is about as hot as it gets in the summersoaked south yet there was alan b graf jr executive vice president and cfo of fdx corp parent of federal express down in the trenches sweating in a golf shirt heavy gloves and steeltoed boots hauling packages at the company’s central hub facility his suit “stashed somewhere in a locker” graf and his staff of finance executives left their thirdfloor offices to pitch in wherever needed at the airportbased hub the reason the stunning volume increases caused by a strike last year by united parcel service workers a major fedex competitor “i forgot to wear a back brace that first day” says graf a former college athlete who should have known better “i didn’t forget it the second day” recommended stories how dollar shave club bested a consumer giant investors beware emerging growth company stats suggest election drags down small business optimism graf also never forgot to see the opportunity in the situation “it was educational” he says of the day period in which fedex handled more than a million pounds of additional traffic a day “i began to think about how efficient the superhub could be during peak operation hours and what additional technology we could put in to make things more efficient and easier” fedex estimates it’s been able to keep  percent of the  extra packages a day it delivered during the strike ultimately adding roughly  million to its domestic revenue such a “keen sense of looking beyond the financials” says frederick w smith fdx chairman president and ceo has been graf’s trademark ever since the yearold joined the company in  but it is in the financials that his contributions have been most apparent to wit since  when he was promoted to senior vice president and cfo overall revenues have more than doubled from  billion to  billion in  the onceunprofitable international segment now contributes  percent of total corporate operating profits and the tide of declining revenues per package in the united states has been reversed global powerhouse graf’s impact was first felt in the international segment which was losing almost  million a day when he became cfo “we had aggressively grown our international network including an expansive intraeuropean network” he recalls “we believed we could serve all three markets in europe equally well intracountry intraeurope and intra continental we were wrong there was long entrenched competition in these markets we also found we needed significantly different operations for say intracountry versus intracontinental we were sending out waves of couriers pickup and delivery times were all over the place and nothing meshed” ultimately fedex embarked on a european restructuring that refocused its capital on just its intracontinental service a painful decision that cost more than  jobs–not to mention a  million writeoff but it was absolutely necessary for fedex to put a tourniquet on the bleeding and rebuild its european base “it was time to cut off money to what was a losing operation alan recognized this and made tough decisions” says jim runde managing director in charge of worldwide transportation at morgan stanley dean witter adding “he could look beyond the european debacle and see how his decision eventually would translate into a higher pe” to monitor fedex’s progress graf developed key performance metrics by which the international operations are now measured–in particular increasing volume by  to  percent per year for overnight packages “previously we simply had this belief that since our strategy worked in the us it stood to reason it would work the same in europe” he says “but we hadn’t built a financial and strategic model to understand our cost structure once we did that it became clear that all these tremendous investments we were making– investments that were bucking the conventional wisdom on the street– would pay off and they have” in  international revenues reached  billion and international operating profit totaled  million competing on the ground domestically graf worked on multiple fronts to tackle the company’s declining yield per package–the result of aggressive price competition and a higher dependence on heavily discounted customers to reverse the trend graf and his crossfunctional team first renewed existing accounts to eliminate some loss leaders next they implemented selective rate increases for some large and national accounts beginning in january  and finally in july  the company implemented distancebased pricing for all domestic express services the result was that the yield per package which had fallen to  in  was up to  by  to increase revenues going forward graf recently turned to a subject both he and smith had considered for some time acquiring or developing a lowerpriced less time sensitive package transportation service to compete against ups’s threeday product their brainstorming led to the  billion acquisition of caliber system inc a ground transport company in akron last january “it was a very smart move because it effectively gave fedex a position along the continuum of services provided to the customer that they did not have before” says jack levy head of mergers and acquisitions at merrill lynch graf took the lead on the project not only identifying the target but also pursuing it when all appeared lost “fred gave me the go ahead and there were lots of stops and starts” the cfo says “ultimately we changed the transaction from a cash acquisition to a stock merger the market had changed so significantly that the stock merger became a creative rather than a dilutive strategy for fdx shareholders that was not the case when we made the original contact” others agree “alan nailed caliber at a very attractive price for fdx shareholders” says runde “he figured the timing perfectly he also outfoxed the competition in terms of this timing the competition was asleep he wasn’t he seized the day and made a decision to go forward on his terms without going to an auction ultimately he created a lot of value for the company” upon completion of the deal graf was kicked upstairs to become fdx’s first cfo and he seems bound to run a company some day a prediction by jim riddle of riddle  mcgrath an atlantabased executive search firm “alan provides leadership and a style that others want to follow” he says “he’s not focused just on the numbers he understands the big picture and has all the attributes of a ceo” of course if things don’t pan out as riddle projects there’s always a career in package loading and unloading “i liked the physical part of the job” graf says adding with a fake groan “once i got that back brace” leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name  email  website advertisement popular articles
