well as technology to its power customers the energy industry is rapidly changing our solutions are facilitating cheaper green solar power for business frequently asked questions commercial industrial and government cig customers exploring a rooftop solar solution typically seek answers to the following questions reliability – will the system be as reliable as the current electricity supply yes – the solar power supplied by the panels will supplement the electricity supply from the grid in the event of a technical fault or outage your supply would automatically resume from the grid equipment – what equipment do you use at vivopower we place reliability and safety of power provision to customers as of the utmost importance we provide power and we take away the hassle of clients having to follow the latest in solar panel or inverter technology it is seamless to our clients and you only need to worry about your core business aesthetics  space required – will the panels impact the aesthetics of the building the panels will only be visible if you are viewing the roof space panels are nonintrusive and are prevalent throughout the world inverters are the only other visible pieces of equipment and are small and will be installed in areas of low impact in consultation with the customer safety – is the system safe both when being installed and in operation yes – we commission approved installers to install the system according to all relevant standards and have the utmost focus on safety the operating system is safe and will not impact day to day operations should the equipment fail power will immediately be sourced from the grid with no interruption to supply this changeover happens safely and automatically without intervention business interruption – will the installation or operation interrupt our business standard solar installations typically involve minimal if any business interruption the majority of work occurs outside the premises and the actual period of time that power is interrupted is much shorter than the total installation time – usually the interruption is only required to connect the new equipment to the existing equipment we will liaise with you through the installation process and work with you on scheduling any potential power outage vivopower will be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the system for the life of the contract contract period – what is the length of the typical contract as we are installing long life assets and there is no upfront capital required by you for those assets we do need to have a longerterm agreement we need to fit this to a business case depending on your tariffs and how long you or your landlord intends to be at site we will discuss this with you in the early stages of engagement to ensure there is a strong business fit between us as we will be your partner and supplier through a longterm agreement estimated savings – what level of cost savings and carbon savings can be expected the exact level of savings depends on the particular project however with a ppa power purchase agreement there will be no upfront capex and there will normally be material ongoing power cost savings the carbon savings on each unit of energy consumed will be  solar is emission free how do we get started we will meet with you and request current energy usage data from analysis of that data we will be able to put together a package that suits your needs and will give you an indication of contract length and next steps enjoy cheaper easier and greener power than you do today
