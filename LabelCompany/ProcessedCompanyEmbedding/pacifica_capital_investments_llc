pacifica capital investments llc   real estate history  experience – pacifica capital investments llc real estate history  experiencehomereal estate history  experience real estate history  experience real estate investment philosophy real estate in the media founding in los angeles pacifica began in  as a los angelesbased firm that specialized in investing in commercial real estate from its inception the organization was committed to implementing its valuebased investment philosophy • buy real estate at a discount to replacement cost in markets and product types where we have superior knowledge and expertise hold for the long term and consider selling when markets reach price levels that are not sustainable andor when excess new supply threatens market rents and values with its private investors pacifica began acquiring improving developing and managing commercial income properties its affiliate provided commercial brokerage services for its independent landlord and tenant clientele as well as for pacifica’s properties in the early ’s southern california began recovering from a deep recession that had resulted in depressed prices for commercial real estate pacifica seized on the opportunity to acquire income properties at below their replacement cost and assembled a portfolio extending from west la to the south bay area of los angeles county as the market improved selective properties were added where development and redevelopment could create value when prices became inflated in the late ’s pacifica began selling its holdings and looking elsewhere for investment opportunities signature portfolio in denver a regional search led us to denver in  where severely depressed real estate prices followed the regional energy and real estate boom and bust cycle of the early ’s repeating its successful southern california business plan pacifica began acquiring commercial income property with its private clients as the local economy was rebounding to provide a handson presence it soon opened offices in denver that accommodated some of pacifica’s top executives – including steve leonard – who relocated from los angeles to take full advantage of the opportunity as the cycle continued and the market improved pacifica began partnering with institutional investors on both acquisitions and development opportunities some of those same institutional partners including the mack family of new yorkpreviously “apollo” have resumed investing with us after pacifica returned to southern california by  pacifica became the largest private owner of commercial space in colorado the nd biggest commercial property manager in the state and its th largest commercial brokerage firm as the cycle matured and commercial markets became strong in the mid’s additional investors with large amounts of capital arrived and new developments were planned that would likely exceed the increase in demand so in  and  pacifica sold its  million square feet of industrial retail and office product for approximately  million those sales resulted in an attractive irr for the portfolio as they were exiting the denver market principals in the pacifica portfolio began to pursue opportunities in other markets modest portfolio in las vegas with a local partner blake isaacson took his portion of the denver portfolio to southern nevada to establish new industrial and retail holdings initially funded in part by  exchange money generated from sales in colorado the portfolio was assembled early in the strong part of the cycle before being liquidated in approximately  and  as prices began to reach their cyclical highpoints resume investing in los angeles meanwhile steve leonard with pacifica’s la partners developed again in southern california from  through  when they built a portfolio of approximately  million square feet of commercial product those efforts culminated in  when pacifica sold the last facilities built in that phase of the cycle for approximately  million again resulting in an impressive irr on the equity invested other than that selective activity pacifica had generally paused investing in commercial real estate in the early ’s as it was concerned that too much capital – public private and institutional – was being deployed in the sector those concerns proved justified as the great recession decimated real estate markets creating new opportunities to find value for pacifica’s capital and that of its investors multifamily development in gateway cities the upheaval in housing markets and other demographic economic and regulatory dynamics following the financial crisis created strong demand for urban apartments – both among renters and institutional investors including public reits the lack of building to meet that demand in the early years of this decade created a unique development opportunity to build and sell or to hold the projects cyrene highrise project in downtown seattle pacifica joined forces with matt burton now with pacifica and paul keller of urban partners along with the mack family of new york apollo real estate advisors “area” to capitalize developments in key cities up and down the west coast that were experiencing strong growth in highpaying jobs that portfolio was anchored by a number of developments in seattle as well as projects in southern california and portland the total development cost of building out that portfolio will be in excess of  billion when they are completed not all by pacifica institutional investment partners have included carlyle pritzker aecom capital la county public employee pension and cigna insurance san diego industrial officeshowroom carlsbad research center carlsbad ca by  the san diego economy was experiencing sustainable growth and pacifica anticipated that the recovery cycle for commercial real estate would follow sure enough vacancy rates began to fall as the local economy expanded creating ideal conditions for investing in a market that had not seen speculative construction for many years pacifica teamed with local partners primarily raf pacifica group founded by adam robinson and began buying existing product at attractive discounts to replacement cost as we gained confidence in the market and our local lionshead ave carlsbad ca capabilities pacifica took on lease up risk in exchange for deeper discounts from sellers we also initiated the redevelopment of projects where value could be created the portfolio of existing product has grown to include  million square feet of commercial buildings acquired for approximately  million we are particularly focused on industrialofficerd showroom product in and around central and north san diego county where two principals of the firm reside steve leonard and blake isaacson elevate creative industrial development carlsbad ca san diego development we are now also developing among the first speculative projects in north county the industrialrd market for existing buildings is very tight as the local economy continues to grow and new construction is minimal just over  planned in a market with a low  vacancy rate pacifica has seen similar conditions when it started development instigate creative industrial development carlsbad ca in other markets throughout its history those factors when combined with the strength of our local partners’ capabilities and our deep penetration and knowledge of the san diego real estate market lead us to be confident about the investment potential of our new construction projects our institutional partners include carlyle in this portfolio our plan is to take advantage of favorable supply and demand conditions to build and lease high end industrialrd buildings we then plan to sell them at attractive prices to institutional who are particularly interested in buying new buildings that are leased in strong markets like san diego we will also be constructing more traditional industrial buildings for sale to ownerusers who will pay high prices at this point in the cycle santa barbara portfolio the leonards decided to relocate to montecito and steve has established relationships with local real estate professionals those connections have led to new development opportunities including a unti multifamily project in santa barbara we are attracted to these dynamics for the development of commercial real estate in and around santa barbara a strong local economy healthy demand among tenants and limited competitions from new construction due to the difficulty in securing the approval for new developments pacifica senior living it is no secret that the huge baby boomer generation is heading towards retirement and old age and its members and their families are making arrangements accordingly senior housing is experiencing among the fastest growing demand among all real estate sectors indeed demographic life span and aging patterns suggest that senior housing will be part of a growth industry for decades to come – a very desirable feature for any investment we have had our eye on those attractive dynamics as they have become more compelling and recently pulled the trigger when the right ingredients came together a specific land opportunity in the roaring fork river valley with a local development partner we know an experienced operator of senior communities whom we trust and in related markets where we have a familiarity and history pacifica real estate senior living fund i llc acquired  acres of land in carbondale colorado to develop and operate a unit senior living center sopris lodge our project will accommodate three key needs during the typical aging cycle initially independent living assisted living options as the residents slow down and memory care our expectation is to hold the investment for the long term for cash flow and appreciation magnified by modest leverage we hope to add to the fund additional senior communities in the denver metro area and in other locations in the front range the roaring fork river valley and the western slope and where the leonards have had a “second home” since the s   about us – pacifica capital investments llc about ushomeabout us about us our team pacifica’s history disclosures pacifica’s goal is to build long term wealth for clients by investing in public companies that have strong prospects for the foreseeable future our proprietary investment process focuses on acquiring stock in those businesses as part of a concentrated investment portfolio at prices below our estimate of their intrinsic value our approach reflects patience and discipline – and they are the foundation of pci’s longrun success no part of our investment management is outsourced we analyze and select each company and then opportunistically include each one in a portfolio that has the best long term potential we seek to minimize risk by knowing more about the companies we own pacifica gains no comfort in “diversifying” holdings beyond the top tier of businesses where that intimate knowledge becomes increasingly less likely instead we concentrate holdings in our favorite companies rather than spread them over ones that aren’t the investable assets of the firm’s principals are concentrated in the same basic portfolio of companies as our clients depending upon the opportunities available at the time   pacifica’s history – pacifica capital investments llc pacifica’s historyhomeabout uspacifica’s history about us our team pacifica’s history disclosures pacifica began as a los angelesbased real estate investment company in  from its

at a significant discount to intrinsic value with its private investors pacifica developed acquired and managed commercial income property its affiliate leonard  ohren provided commercial brokerage services for its independent landlord and tenant clientele as well as for pacifica’s properties in the early to mid’s southern california began recovering from a deep recession that resulted in

some of pacifica’s top executives who relocated from los angeles to take full advantage of the opportunity as the market improved pacifica began partnering with institutional investors on both acquisitions and development excessive building in colorado in the mid’s became a concern so in  pacifica sold its  million square foot portfolio for approximately  million resulting in an exceptionally high internal rate of return “irr” for the portfolio as it was exiting the denver market pacifica began to see opportunities to acquire and develop again in southern california from  thru  pacifica assembled a portfolio of approximately  million square feet those efforts culminated in  when pacifica sold the last buildings in the portfolio for a sale of approximately  million again resulting in an impressive irr on the investment during this period pacifica established an office in madrid spain and began assembling and developing a  acre retail center and industrial park within the city limits of madrid pacifica capital investments was formed in april of  and has applied the same philosophy pacifica executed so successfully in real estate investments now in its th year pci has grown significantly with assets under management of  million as of the beginning of    performance record – pacifica capital investments llc performance recordhomeresultsperformance record performance record our performance record below is a chart showing the difference between the market’s performance as measured by the sp  total return index which reinvests all dividends from april   the pci start date through december   versus the composite performance of all fully discretionary accounts managed by pci   listed below are comparisons between the market’s performance as measured by the sp  total return index which reinvests all dividends from april   the pci start date through december   versus the composite performance of all fully discretionary accounts managed by pci pci performance for each year is unaudited and is a time weighted rate of return for that year except for  which is an internal rate of return for those years irr is a dollarweighted return that accounts for contributions and withdrawals during the period twr is a timeweighted return that effectively eliminates the effects of contributions and withdrawals and their timing  is a partial year the sp  total return measures the change from the start of the period to the end of the period assuming no contributions andor withdrawals and includes dividends the “total” is for the entire period compounded annually pci results are shown net of all fees including management fees brokerage fees and custodial expenses and reflect the reinvestment of all dividends and earnings performance results provided herein are the aggregate of all fully discretionary accounts managed by pci including those accounts no longer with pci and include the performance of the accounts of pci’s principals which do not incur management fees and certain other accounts that have reduced management fees minimal leverage and short selling has been used since inception for the pci managed accounts the effects of such leverage and short selling on pci’s performance figures have been nominal results for individual accounts are varied and will vary in the future in addition it is not likely that the relative performance of pci’s managed accounts will exceed the performance of the broader stock market as measured by the sp  total return or other broad market indexes by as large a margin as has occurred to date the stock market faced an unprecedented decline in the year  which strongly impacted the performance of the sp  total return index during the time period shown in addition pci’s performance during the year  was significantly enhanced by the strong performance of one large position in its accounts under management the  total ending balance for all accounts was approximately  million and approximately  million was in accounts of pci principals leonard and pemberton family accounts total number of individual accounts was  as of  past performance is not a guarantee or indicator of future results and investors should not assume that investments made on their behalf by pci will be profitable and may in fact result in a loss investors also should not assume that pci’s results will outperform the sp  total return index or other broad market indexes in the future the investment objective of pci’s managed accounts is capital appreciation pci’s strategy is to concentrate its investments in a limited number of positions with certain positions representing an intentionally large size in the accounts this concentration is likely to result in greater volatility than the overall market as measured by the sp  total return index which is made up of  large companies the sp  total return index reflects both changes in the prices of stocks in the sp  index as well as the reinvestment of the dividend income from its underlying shares the index does not bear fees and expenses and investors cannot invest directly in the index in addition pci’s strategy is to “hold for the long term” which reduces trading costs   investment philosophy – pacifica capital investments llc investment philosophyhomephilosophy  processinvestment philosophy investment philosophy investment process investment philosophy pacifica’s first rule of investing is “no permanent loss of capital” and our investment approach is designed to avoid that occurrence over the long term the key to our success is finding outstanding businesses that can be bought at attractive prices and holding them over the long term – and the longer the better with tax rates on the rise our “buy and hold” philosophy also creates tax efficiencies for most investors pacifica often holds substantial cash positions for varying periods of time while we await opportunities to buy interest in great companies when the market makes them available at discounted prices until compelling investment opportunities present themselves your money will remain in interest or dividendbearing instruments focused pacifica capital investments focuses on finding quality businesses that we understand well we define these as having favorable long term prospects sustainable competitive advantages and capable and shareholderoriented management teams pci’s investments are most often in companies having strong brands leading market positions honest and capable management high returns on invested capital and sustainable competitive advantages we concentrate on select industries and limit our holdings to just those top companies when we can buy them at attractive prices pacifica seeks to minimize risk by owning fewer businesses we know more about we see no benefit to extending our holdings beyond that first tier and into companies with futures that are more difficult to evaluate value investing we strive to invest in just the best businesses when the market makes them available at prices below our estimate of their intrinsic value since that condition doesn’t regularly occur the pci approach often leads to opportunistic acquisitions of quality companies when there is a solvable concern within a company trouble in its sector or fear is prevalent in the broader market the key to pci’s success is finding outstanding businesses that can be bought at attractive prices and holding them over long periods of time the longer the better we wait patiently until the opportunity emerges and buy only when we have confidence in the longterm performance of the business if those criteria aren’t met our philosophy dictates that we hold cash and await value longterm results the key to our longterm success is that we have found and invested in outstanding businesses bought at attractive prices — and have typically held them for long periods of time our goal is to beat the market over time — and not worry about beating it every time pci’s long term results illustrated in our performance record are a testament to this rewarding strategy   about us – pacifica capital investments llc
