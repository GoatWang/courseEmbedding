the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search hayes microcomputer products was a usbased manufacturer of modems the company is well known for the smartmodem which introduced a control language for operating the functions of the modem via the serial interface to the data terminal equipment in contrast to manual operation with frontpanel switches this smart modem approach dramatically simplified

known for high quality products they remained a major vendor throughout the s periodically introducing models with higher throughput in the early s a number of greatly costreduced highperformance

the phone jacks and analog hardware were connected via the ribbon cable dennis c hayes left the georgia institute of technology in the mids to work at an early data communications company national data corp a company that handled electronic money transfers and credit card authorizations hayes job was to set up modem connections for ndcs customers at the time modems generally came in two versions one for the enduser that required the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into the connection and disconnection was entirely manual with the user picking up the phones handset dialing manually and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard disconnecting at the end of the session was also manual with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging it up on the phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the onhook state and end the call there were optional systems to dial the phone or pick it up but these were generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used on one end of the connection or the other for instance the autodialler was a system that automated the action of picking up the phone and dialing a number and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks who might use one to send an endofday file to branch offices early hayes productsedit hayes was a computer hobbyist and felt that modems would be highly compelling to users of the new bit computers that would soon be known as home computers however existing modems were simply too expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users what was needed was a single modem that could do it all connect directly to the phone answer incoming calls dial numbers to initiate outgoing calls and hang up when the call was complete the main problem with producing such a modem was forwarding commands from the computer this could be addressed in internal modems that plugged directly into the computers motherboard such modems had access to the computers main memory and by dedicating certain memory locations or registers to various status readouts or commands software programs running on the computer could control the modem this was a straightforward and thus a popular solution the novation applecat ii for the apple ii computer was an early programmable modem of this type hayes started producing similar products at a hobby level in his kitchen in april  with his friend and coworker dale heatherington their first product was the a a  bits bell compatible design for s bus machines business picked up quickly and in january  they quit their jobs at national data to form their own company dc hayes associates sales were further improved in early  with the introduction of the  bits micromodem  for s bus computers and the micromodem ii for the apple ii that used an external microcoupler to connect to telephone lines in  the company changed its name to hayes microcomputer products under which it operated for most of its history the smartmodemedit the original model  baud smartmodem although powerful the internal modem was commercially impractical not only did it require special driver software but a different hardware design was needed for every computer bus including apple ii s trs and others some popular computers like the atari  did not even integrate internal slots an obvious solution was to use the rs serial port modems were serial devices and generally driven off rs anyway and most computer designs included an rs port or some variant hayes and the companys marketing manager glenn sirkis approached heatherington with an outline for a new commanddriven external modem a few external modems already offered the ability to dial the phone by entering a phone number when the modem was first started but the real problem was somehow sending a command to hang up while the modem was already connected there needed to be some way to indicate that the characters flowing out from the computer to the modem were not simply additional data to be sent to the far end but commands to be acted on several solutions to the problem were studied and in the end heatherington decided the only practical one was to have the modem operate in two modes in one data mode all data forwarded from the computer were modulated and sent over the connected telephone line as it was with any other modem in the other command mode data forwarded from the computer were instead interpreted as commands in this way the modem could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations such as hang up the phone or dial a number the modem would normally start up in command mode the problem was how to move from mode to mode one option would be to signal this change—put yourself into command mode—via one of the many pins in the rs cable however while the pin connector on the modem side had more than enough pins for this purpose even some meant for this purpose the computer side often used a much smaller pin connector and equally often many of these pins werent actually connected or accessible from software in fact there were very few pins that were guaranteed to work on all computers mostly the data in and out ready indications that said whether the modem or computer was operational and sometimes flowcontrol pins while it would have been possible to use some of these pins for the sort of commandswitching they needed the ready indications for example would have sufficed heatherington instead came up with the idea of using a rarely seen sequence of characters for this duty since these characters could be sent to the modem using the same two data pins that the port would need anyway they could be sure that such a system would work on every computer the sequence he decided on was  three plus signs when this was received from the computer the modem would switch from data to command mode of course it was entirely possible that the computer would send this sequence for other reasons for example the sequence might be contained within a text file describing how modems worked in order to filter out these accidental sequences heatheringtons design only switched to command mode if the sequence was led and followed by a onesecond pause the guard time in which no other data were sent in this case it could be safely assumed that the sequence was being sent deliberately by a user as opposed to being buried in the middle of a data stream with the basic idea outlined hayes and sirkis gave heatherington the goahead to build a prototype by adding a microcontroller to an otherwise lightly modified version of their existing  bits hardware sirkis was particularly interested in using the  mhz pic microcontroller which were available for only us a piece after six months of trying to get the modem working with the pic heatherington gave up and demanded they use the  mhz zilog z instead a us part sirkis acquiesced and a working prototype was soon complete hayes added a requirement of his own that the modem be able to automatically detect what speed the computers serial port was set to when first powered on this was not simple unless the modem knew what data were initially being sent allowing it to time the bits and thereby guess the speed heatherington eventually suggested the use of a wellknown character sequence for this purpose recommending at for attention which is prefixed on all commands the new design housed in an extruded aluminum case sized to allow a standard desktop telephone to rest on top was announced in april  it was known simply as the smartmodem the smartmodem was the first modem integrating complete control over the phone line and that allowed it to be used in exactly the same fashion with any computer hayes originally had big plans for the form factor referring to it as the hayes stack and intending to release a range of products that could be stacked beside the computer in the end only two nonmodem devices were added to the line the hayes stack chronograph an external realtime clock and the transet  a printer buffer and primitive email box both of these items sales were apparently dismal early advertising referred to the smartmodem as the hayes stack smartmodem but this naming convention was dropped a short time later at the time of its introduction the modem market was fairly small and competitors generally ignored the smartmodem but it was not long before hobbyists were able to combine the smartmodem with new software to create the first real bulletin board systems bbses which created significant market demand the market grew rapidly in the mids and as the smartmodem was the only truly universal modem on the market hayes grew to take over much of the market heatherington retired from what was then a large company in  competitionedit the modem market in the s was very simple and stagnant modems tended to sell at us per baud hayes saw no need to be different—the original hayes  baud modem sold for us retail at that price point hayes could build a cadillac of modems using highquality components an extruded aluminum case and an acrylic front panel with a number of led indicators as the modem market expanded competitors quickly copied the hayes command set and often the hayes industrial design as well to compete with hayes on price early competitors manufactured modems using lowcost components that were often unreliable hayes quickly gained a reputation for high quality and for a time held a  market share also differentiating hayes from its competition was the smartmodems use of the guard time hayes had patented this concept in  in patent  the modem with improved escape sequence with guard time mechanism generally referred to as the hayes  patent hayes licensed the guard time to other manufacturers for  a modem—a charge which competitors derisively termed the modem tax a number of manufacturers banded together and introduced the time independent escape sequence or ties but it was not as robust as heatheringtons system and never became very successful in  at the spring comdex in atlantic city hayes introduced the bell compatible smartmodem  for  the first practical allinone  bits bell compatible modem the earlier design was redesignated the smartmodem  at the time hayes was one of the few modem companies with the capital and engineering wherewithal to develop entirely new modem architectures however this was only a limited competitive advantage since it was not long before companies offering hayes clones introduced derivative  bits models of their own the  bits market existed for a relatively short time in  the ccitt introduced the vbis standard for  bits operation this was the first time that the ccitts standard predated bells introductions avoiding compatibility issues that had plagued earlier standards modem companies quickly incorporated vbis into their product lines hayes was no exception the company introduced its vbis smartmodem  at us in  the  bits smartmodem also remained available at a lower price point competition drove prices rapidly downward and by  a clone  bits modem was generally available for around us after  modems increasingly became a commodity item higher speeds and increased competitionedit hayes was not as fast as some other manufacturers to release modems that ran faster than  bits which opened the door for us robotics usr and telebit to meet market demand with faster products in  hayes responded with the  bits pingpong protocol which was later renamed express  the name referred to the way the modems could pingpong the single highspeed link between the two ends on demand in a fashion similar to the usr and telebit protocols however the express  both was late to market and lacked error correction making it far less attractive than its competition the design was generally unsuccessful and for the first time hayes lost cachet as the leader in modem design and manufacture hayess slow entry into the highspeed market led to a fracturing of the command set in order to set up the modem to accept or reject certain types of connections hayes had added a number of new commands prefixed by  the ampersand to the smartmodem  when they moved to the smartmodem  they simply extended the set further using the same syntax the other companies involved all used their own syntax usr used an incompatible set of prefixed commands microcom used  and telebit was based on setting a series of registers all of these survived for some time into the early s through the late s and early s new standard highspeed modes were introduced by the ccitt the first of these v offered  bits in both directions at the same time whereas earlier highspeed protocols were highspeed in one direction only in  hayes effectively abandoned their express  protocol in favor of v which along with mnp support was built into the  usd hayes vseries smartmodem  in  the company introduced the smartmodem ultra  which offered both v and express  support and added the new vbis error correction and compression system in addition to mnp v modems remained fairly rare and expensive although by  thirdparty v modems were available for approximately  usd vbisedit in  rockwell introduced a lowcost chipset supporting the new  bits vbis standard along with similar v and vbis  bits versions all of which supported mnp vbis and optionally  bits v fax modem capabilities their system was introduced commercially in the suprafaxmodem  which went on to become a runaway bestseller soon there were literally hundreds of similar models on the market and rockwells competitors also rushed in with similar chipsets of their own hayes was never able to reestablish itself as a market leader through this era they quickly introduced their own vbis model in the fall of  the us smartmodem ultra  but this point express  had little cachet and the market was already flooded with lowercost modems they then split their line into the accura and optima brands offering the accura as a lowcost model although the feature sets were not that different between the two lines hayes eventually purchased two of their competitors practical peripherals and cardinal turning them into lowcost brands in order to compete with companies such as zoom telephonics as speeds increased with the introduction of v and v hayes increasingly became a follower rather than a leader by the mids their modems were also based on the rockwell chip set and had little to distinguish themselves from other vendors oddly it was the rockwell chip set that also restandardized the various command sets back on the original highspeed ones introduced by hayes as the rockwellbased systems became more and more common other companies like att introduced new versions of their modem chip sets with identical commands rockwell had taken their commands from the vseries smartmodems so by the mids the market was once again based largely on a real hayes command set decline and falledit hayes realized that changes in the telephone networks would eventually render the modem in its current form obsolete as early as  he started efforts to produce consumerready isdn modems betting the company on isdn becoming a widespread standard—which was widely believed at the time by the early s this was a major focus of the company however unlike europe or japan isdn simply never happened in the us consumer market the whole model was based on endtoend digital communications and was thus limited to the speed of the longdistance carrier lines either  or  kbits the bell companies were interested in deploying isdn but doing so required customerend installations to make their conventional telephones work which made the system unattractive for widescale deployment additionally the rise of the internet in the mids made pointtopoint communications far less interesting after dialing their local internet service provider the user could call out at high speed to services around the world so the need for longdistance data calls was generally eliminated as a result of this shift there was no real need to limit the user to the speed of the longdistance lines giving the bell companies flexibility in terms of what to install at the users site their attention turned to asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl which ran over the existing wiring and did not block a telephone connection in the process the enduser was offered much higher speeds while still being able to use existing phones with the added benefit of helping tie the user to the telephone companys own isp hayes having bet the company on a system that was never actually deployed had no new products in the pipeline in an attempt at diversification in january  it had acquired most of the assets of local area network software developer waterloo microsystems inc of waterloo ontario and belatedly entered the operating system os market in june  with lanstep a network os for small offices but this was subsequently abandoned in  in the face of stiff competition particularly from novell netware an effort was started to move into the market for adsl and cable modems but this was a multiyear effort during a period when usr increasingly took over the market they entered chapter  protection in november  exiting in october  as hayes corp after selling  of the company to nortel and a singaporebased venture capital firm in  they merged with access beyond a builder of isp rackmount modems and terminal servers and changed the company name again this time to hayes communications the merger was primarily a way to take the company public the stock started crashing over the next year from around us in early  to pennies in october when they once again filed for chapter  protection no new funding could be found and in  the company assets were liquidated the brand name was purchased and revived by onetime rival zoom technologies in july  zoom continues to use the hayes name on some of their products notesedit a widely circulated

the real problem was somehow sending a command to hang up while the modem was already connected there needed to be some way to indicate that the characters flowing out from the computer to the modem were not simply additional data to be sent to the far end but commands to be acted on several solutions to the problem were studied and in the end heatherington decided the only practical one was to have the modem operate in two modes in one data mode all data forwarded from the computer were modulated and sent over the connected telephone line as it was with any other modem in the other command mode data forwarded from the computer were instead interpreted as commands in this way the modem could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations such as hang up the phone or dial a

when this was received from the computer the modem would switch from data to command mode of course it was entirely possible that the computer would send this sequence for other reasons for example the sequence might be contained within a text file describing how modems worked in order to filter out these accidental sequences heatheringtons design only switched to command mode if the sequence

use the rs serial port modems were serial devices and generally driven off rs anyway and most computer designs included an rs port or some variant hayes and the companys marketing manager glenn sirkis approached heatherington with an outline for a new commanddriven external modem a few external modems already offered the ability to dial the phone by entering a phone number when the modem was first

the modem were not simply additional data to be sent to the far end but commands to be acted on several solutions to the problem were studied and in the end heatherington decided the only practical one was to have the modem operate in two modes in one data mode all data forwarded from the computer were modulated and sent over the connected telephone line as it was with any other modem in the other command mode data forwarded from the computer were instead interpreted as commands in this way the modem could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations such as hang up the phone or dial a number the modem would normally start up in command mode the problem was how to move from mode to mode one option would be to signal this change—put yourself into command mode—via one of the many pins in the rs cable however while the pin connector on the modem side had more than enough pins for this purpose even some meant for this purpose the computer side often used a much

the data in and out ready indications that said whether the modem or computer was operational and sometimes flowcontrol pins while it would have been possible to use some of these pins for the sort of

isdn modems betting the company on isdn becoming a widespread standard—which was widely believed at the time by the early s this was a major focus of the company however unlike europe or japan isdn simply never happened in the us consumer market the whole model was based on endtoend digital communications and was thus limited to the speed of the longdistance carrier lines either  or  kbits the bell companies were interested in deploying isdn but doing so required customerend installations to make their conventional telephones work which made the system unattractive for widescale deployment additionally the rise of the internet in the mids made pointtopoint communications far less interesting after dialing their local internet service provider the user could call out at high speed to services around the world so the need for longdistance data calls was generally eliminated as a result of this shift there was no real need to limit the user to the speed of the longdistance lines giving the bell companies flexibility in terms of what to install at the users site their attention turned to asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl which ran over the existing wiring and did not block a telephone connection in the process the enduser was offered much higher speeds while still being able to use existing phones with the added benefit of helping tie the user to the telephone companys own isp hayes having bet the company on a system that was never actually deployed had no new products in the pipeline in an attempt at diversification in january  it had acquired most of the assets of local area network software developer waterloo microsystems inc of waterloo ontario and belatedly entered the operating system os market in june  with lanstep a network os for small offices but this was subsequently abandoned in  in the face of stiff competition particularly from novell netware an effort was started to move into the market for adsl and cable modems but this was a multiyear effort during a period when usr increasingly took over the market they entered chapter  protection in november  exiting in october  as hayes corp after selling  of the company to nortel and a singaporebased venture capital firm in  they merged with access beyond a builder of isp rackmount modems and terminal servers and changed the company name again this time to hayes communications the merger was primarily a way to take the company public the stock started crashing over the next year from around us in early  to pennies in october when they once again filed for chapter  protection no new funding could be found and in  the company assets were liquidated the brand name was purchased and revived by onetime rival zoom technologies in july  zoom continues to use the hayes name on some

microcomputer products  wikipedia hayes microcomputer products from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search hayes microcomputer products was a usbased manufacturer of modems the company is well known for the smartmodem which introduced a control language for operating the functions of the modem via the serial interface to the data terminal equipment in contrast to manual operation with frontpanel switches this smart modem approach dramatically simplified and automated operation today almost all modems use a variant of the hayes command set hayes was a major brand in the modem market from the introduction of the original  bits smartmodem in  and was known for high quality products they remained a major vendor throughout the s periodically introducing models with higher throughput in the early s a number of greatly costreduced highperformance modems were released by competitors notably the suprafaxmodem  which eroded price points in the market hayes was never able to respond effectively the widespread introduction of adsl and cable modems in the mids repeatedly drove the company in chapter  protection before being liquidated in  contents  before hayes  early hayes products  the smartmodem  competition  higher speeds and increased competition  vbis  decline and fall  notes  references  external links before hayesedit dale heatherington with the prototype a micromodem ii installed in an apple ii the external microcoupler with the phone jacks and analog hardware were connected via the ribbon cable dennis c hayes left the georgia institute of technology in the mids to work at an early data communications company national data corp a company that handled electronic money transfers and credit card authorizations hayes job was to set up modem connections for ndcs customers at the time modems generally came in two versions one for the enduser that required the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into the connection and disconnection was entirely manual with the user picking up the phones handset dialing manually and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard disconnecting at the end of the session was also manual with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging it up on the phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the onhook state and end the call there were optional systems to dial the phone or pick it up but these were generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used on one end of the connection or the other for instance the autodialler was a system that automated the action of picking up the phone and dialing a number and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks who might use one to send an endofday file to branch offices early hayes productsedit hayes was a computer hobbyist and felt that modems would be highly compelling to users of the new bit computers that would soon be known as home computers however existing modems were simply too expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users what was needed was a single modem that could do it all connect directly to the phone answer incoming calls dial numbers to initiate outgoing calls and hang up when the call was complete the main problem with producing such a modem was forwarding commands from the computer this could be addressed in internal modems that plugged directly into the computers motherboard such modems had access to the computers main memory and by dedicating certain memory locations or registers to various status readouts or commands software programs running on the computer could control the modem this was a straightforward and thus a popular solution the novation applecat ii for the apple ii computer was an early programmable modem of this type hayes started producing similar products at a hobby level in his kitchen in april  with his friend and coworker dale heatherington their first product was the a a  bits bell compatible design for s bus machines business picked up quickly and in january  they quit their jobs at national data to form their own company dc hayes associates sales were further improved in early  with the introduction of the  bits micromodem  for s bus computers and the micromodem ii for the apple ii that used an external microcoupler to connect to telephone lines in  the company changed its name to hayes microcomputer products under which it operated for most of its history the smartmodemedit the original model  baud smartmodem although powerful the internal modem was commercially impractical not only did it require special driver software but a different hardware design was needed for every computer bus including apple ii s trs and others some popular computers like the atari  did not even integrate internal slots an obvious solution was to use the rs serial port modems were serial devices and generally driven off rs anyway and most computer designs included an rs port or some variant hayes and the companys marketing manager glenn sirkis approached heatherington with an outline for a new commanddriven external modem a few external modems already offered the ability to dial the phone by entering a phone number when the modem was first started but the real problem was somehow sending a command to hang up while the modem was already connected there needed to be some way to indicate that the characters flowing out from the computer to the modem were not simply additional data to be sent to the far end but commands to be acted on several solutions to the problem were studied and in the end heatherington decided the only practical one was to have the modem operate in two modes in one data mode all data forwarded from the computer were modulated and sent over the connected telephone line as it was with any other modem in the other command mode data forwarded from the computer were instead interpreted as commands in this way the modem could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations such as hang up the phone or dial a number the modem would normally start up in command mode the problem was how to move from mode to mode one option would be to signal this change—put yourself into command mode—via one of the many pins in the rs cable however while the pin connector on the modem side had more than enough pins for this purpose even some meant for this purpose the computer side often used a much smaller pin connector and equally often many of these pins werent actually connected or accessible from software in fact there were very few pins that were guaranteed to work on all computers mostly the data in and out ready indications that said whether the modem or computer was operational and sometimes flowcontrol pins while it would have been possible to use some of these pins for the sort of commandswitching they needed the ready indications for example would have sufficed heatherington instead came up with the idea of using a rarely seen sequence of characters for this duty since these characters could be sent to the modem using the same two data pins that the port would need anyway they could be sure that such a system would work on every computer the sequence he decided on was  three plus signs when this was received from the computer the modem would switch from data to command mode of course it was entirely possible that the computer would send this sequence for other reasons for example the sequence might be contained within a text file describing how modems worked in order to filter out these accidental sequences heatheringtons design only switched to command mode if the sequence was led and followed by a onesecond pause the guard time in which no other data were sent in this case it could be safely assumed that the sequence was being sent deliberately by a user as opposed to being buried in the middle of a data stream with the basic idea outlined hayes and sirkis gave heatherington the goahead to build a prototype by adding a microcontroller to an otherwise lightly modified version of their existing  bits hardware sirkis was particularly interested in using the  mhz pic microcontroller which were available for only us a piece after six months of trying to get the modem working with the pic heatherington gave up and demanded they use the  mhz zilog z instead a us part sirkis acquiesced and a working prototype was soon complete hayes added a requirement of his own that the modem be able to automatically detect what speed the computers serial port was set to when first powered on this was not simple unless the modem knew what data were initially being sent allowing it to time the bits and thereby guess the speed heatherington eventually suggested the use of a wellknown character sequence for this purpose recommending at for attention which is prefixed on all commands the new design housed in an extruded aluminum case sized to allow a standard desktop telephone to rest on top was announced in april  it was known simply as the smartmodem the smartmodem was the first modem integrating complete control over the phone line and that allowed it to be used in exactly the same fashion with any computer hayes originally had big plans for the form factor referring to it as the hayes stack and intending to release a range of products that could be stacked beside the computer in the end only two nonmodem devices were added to the line the hayes stack chronograph an external realtime clock and the transet  a printer buffer and primitive email box both of these items sales were apparently dismal early advertising referred to the smartmodem as the hayes stack smartmodem but this naming convention was dropped a short time later at the time of its introduction the modem market was fairly small and competitors generally ignored the smartmodem but it was not long before hobbyists were able to combine the smartmodem with new software to create the first real bulletin board systems bbses which created significant market demand the market grew rapidly in the mids and as the smartmodem was the only truly universal modem on the market hayes grew to take over much of the market heatherington retired from what was then a large company in  competitionedit the modem market in the s was very simple and stagnant modems tended to sell at us per baud hayes saw no need to be different—the original hayes  baud modem sold for us retail at that price point hayes could build a cadillac of modems using highquality components an extruded aluminum case and an acrylic front panel with a number of led indicators as the modem market expanded competitors quickly copied the hayes command set and often the hayes industrial design as well to compete with hayes on price early competitors manufactured modems using lowcost components that were often unreliable hayes quickly gained a reputation for high quality and for a time held a  market share also differentiating hayes from its competition was the smartmodems use of the guard time hayes had patented this concept in  in patent  the modem with improved escape sequence with guard time mechanism generally referred to as the hayes  patent hayes licensed the guard time to other manufacturers for  a modem—a charge which competitors derisively termed the modem tax a number of manufacturers banded together and introduced the time independent escape sequence or ties but it was not as robust as heatheringtons system and never became very successful in  at the spring comdex in atlantic city hayes introduced the bell compatible smartmodem  for  the first practical allinone  bits bell compatible modem the earlier design was redesignated the smartmodem  at the time hayes was one of the few modem companies with the capital and engineering wherewithal to develop entirely new modem architectures however this was only a limited competitive advantage since it was not long before companies offering hayes clones introduced derivative  bits models of their own the  bits market existed for a relatively short time in  the ccitt introduced the vbis standard for  bits operation this was the first time that the ccitts standard predated bells introductions avoiding compatibility issues that had plagued earlier standards modem companies quickly incorporated vbis into their product lines hayes was no exception the company introduced its vbis smartmodem  at us in  the  bits smartmodem also remained available at a lower price point competition drove prices rapidly downward and by  a clone  bits modem was generally available for around us after  modems increasingly became a commodity item higher speeds and increased competitionedit hayes was not as fast as some other manufacturers to release modems that ran faster than  bits which opened the door for us robotics usr and telebit to meet market demand with faster products in  hayes responded with the  bits pingpong protocol which was later renamed express  the name referred to the way the modems could pingpong the single highspeed link between the two ends on demand in a fashion similar to the usr and telebit protocols however the express  both was late to market and lacked error correction making it far less attractive than its competition the design was generally unsuccessful and for the first time hayes lost cachet as the leader in modem design and manufacture hayess slow entry into the highspeed market led to a fracturing of the command set in order to set up the modem to accept or reject certain types of connections hayes had added a number of new commands prefixed by  the ampersand to the smartmodem  when they moved to the smartmodem  they simply extended the set further using the same syntax the other companies involved all used their own syntax usr used an incompatible set of prefixed commands microcom used  and telebit was based on setting a series of registers all of these survived for some time into the early s through the late s and early s new standard highspeed modes were introduced by the ccitt the first of these v offered  bits in both directions at the same time whereas earlier highspeed protocols were highspeed in one direction only in  hayes effectively abandoned their express  protocol in favor of v which along with mnp support was built into the  usd hayes vseries smartmodem  in  the company introduced the smartmodem ultra  which offered both v and express  support and added the new vbis error correction and compression system in addition to mnp v modems remained fairly rare and expensive although by  thirdparty v modems were available for approximately  usd vbisedit in  rockwell introduced a lowcost chipset supporting the new  bits vbis standard along with similar v and vbis  bits versions all of which supported mnp vbis and optionally  bits v fax modem capabilities their system was introduced commercially in the suprafaxmodem  which went on to become a runaway bestseller soon there were literally hundreds of similar models on the market and rockwells competitors also rushed in with similar chipsets of their own hayes was never able to reestablish itself as a market leader through this era they quickly introduced their own vbis model in the fall of  the us smartmodem ultra  but this point express  had little cachet and the market was already flooded with lowercost modems they then split their line into the accura and optima brands offering the accura as a lowcost model although the feature sets were not that different between the two lines hayes eventually purchased two of their competitors practical peripherals and cardinal turning them into lowcost brands in order to compete with companies such as zoom telephonics as speeds increased with the introduction of v and v hayes increasingly became a follower rather than a leader by the mids their modems were also based on the rockwell chip set and had little to distinguish themselves from other vendors oddly it was the rockwell chip set that also restandardized the various command sets back on the original highspeed ones introduced by hayes as the rockwellbased systems became more and more common other companies like att introduced new versions of their modem chip sets with identical commands rockwell had taken their commands from the vseries smartmodems so by the mids the market was once again based largely on a real hayes command set decline and falledit hayes realized that changes in the telephone networks would eventually render the modem in its current form obsolete as early as  he started efforts to produce consumerready
