insulin producers in  the company announced that it had responded to two investigations into possible insulin pricefixing in an april  filing with the securities and exchange commission sec the company reported it had received “civil investigative demands” – requests for documents and other evidence – from the attorneys general of washington state and new mexico who were investigating insulin price hikes the company said the washington investigation sought information “relating to the pricing of our insulin products and our relationships with pharmacy benefit managers” lilly said it was cooperating with both investigations the probes follow  years of rapidly rising insulin prices and increased public political and regulatory scrutiny on the cost of the medicine vital to keep people with type  diabetes alive a  study in the journal of the american medical association found that insulin prices in the us nearly tripled between  and  a  study in the journal of the american medical association found that insulin prices in the us nearly tripled between  and  by january  a month’s supply of insulin could cost as much as  the american diabetes association reported that some patients were resorting to a risky practice of “rationing” doses to make ends meet taking too small a dose skipping doses or using expired insulin to save money can result in severe kidney damage or death for people with type  diabetes news investigations have documented lilly and the other two largest insulin manufacturers – novo nordisk and sanofi – have raised insulin prices in near lockstep for years bloomberg which first reported on the pattern called it “shadow pricing” meaning one company shadowing another’s price increase by almost the same amount the difference is usually so small there is no competitive advantage for one product over the others in november  two members of congress sen bernie sanders of vermont and rep elijah cummings authored a letter to the us justice department and federal trade commission calling for investigations into the price hikes by the three companies and others in march  lilly and the two other companies were named among the defendants in a count class action lawsuit in a new jersey federal court the suit claims the manufacturers colluded with pharmacy benefit managers pbms to fix insulin prices and violated federal antitrust laws the

was also named in at least two more similar class action lawsuits over insulin pricing the company denied the allegations in all three lawsuits and promised to defend against them “vigorously” just two months later in may  lilly raised the price of humalog by  percent to  for a  ml vial novo nordisk followed suit raising the price of its competing insulin  percent to  – a difference between the two products’ prices of just cents in its april  sec filing lilly said revenue for humalog had increased  percent to  million in the us in the first three months of  worldwide humalog sales rose  percent to  million problematic medications prove costly for eli lilly and company lilly has also faced financial setbacks and regulatory scrutiny over several highprofile medications in recent years lawsuits settlements and even a record criminal fine have affected the company’s finances in  the fda approved lilly’s zyprexa olanzapine for treatment of psychotic disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder zyprexa works by binding receptors in the brain reducing delusions and hallucinations more than  lawsuits were filed by people who claimed they developed diabetes or related conditions after taking zyprexa studies later linked the drug to weight gain and increased blood sugar levels and by  lilly had paid  billion to settle more than  lawsuits filed by people who claimed in court documents they developed diabetes or related conditions after taking zyprexa the us department of justice doj also brought criminal and civil charges against lilly after the company promoted zyprexa for treatments the fda had not approved these included the treatment of dementia and alzheimer’s disease in  lilly pleaded guilty to the federal charges against the company it agreed to pay more than  billion to resolve the case this included an million civil settlement with the doj and a criminal fine of  million – the largest ever in a health care case at the time the company is believed to be shielded from liability in a joint venture with japanese drug maker takeda that resulted in another multibillion dollar court settlement in  the fda approved actos pioglitazone to treat type  diabetes in the us developed by takeda and marketed in the us by eli lilly until  actos became one of the best selling drugs in the world for a short time but studies and reports of serious side effects prompted the fda to conclude that it could increase the risk of bladder cancer in people who took it takeda agreed to settle more than  actos lawsuits for  billion in  lilly said in its  annual report that its business agreement with takeda required the japanese company to “defend and indemnify us against our losses and expenses” in the us lawsuits the drug cymbalta duloxetine also led to lawsuits when people taking it developed medical complications when they stopped taking it withdrawal symptoms could sometimes be lifethreatening these included extreme mood swings and physical or neurological problems in  the fda termed the withdrawal symptoms “cymbalta discontinuation syndrome” in a review of the drug the agency said it was “more severe and much more widespread than acknowledged” by the company the fda also found lilly had not adequately warned people about just how serious these symptoms could be the agency required lilly to take several steps to improve warnings including setting up a system to collect complaints about the drug in  lilly said it had established a settlement framework to settle the nearly  lawsuits still pending in various us courts

manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers the fda and the public to increase sales the public is exposed to pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising for example critics say abbvie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as androgel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men they created a marketing campaign around the condition “low t” that featured a quiz for men to selfdiagnose low t symptoms androgel above was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up the testosterone market soared into the billions as a result but few studies back up drugcompany claims that the drug significantly enhances mood vitality and sexual performance studies also link these drugs to heart problems the fda added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to big pharma doctors conduct research with funds from big pharma private charities and foundations account for a mere  percent of the estimated  billion spent on biomedical research in the us each year pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately  percent big pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout the trade group phrma has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena including  who worked for a member of congress  who worked for a federal agency  who worked for a congressional committee two who worked for the white house one who worked in the court system using these connections to pursue industry goals big pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest marketing research and development rd and drug cost americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases thousands of dollars more per prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed

readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted

glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received
