analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the companys condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes set forth in item  of part i of this quarterly report on form q our mda set forth in item  of part ii of our  annual report on form k and our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in item  of part ii of our  annual report on form k see part ii item a risk factors below and cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking information above and the information referenced therein for a description of risks that we face and important factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forwardlooking statements all amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions except per share amounts or where otherwise noted when we crossreference to a note we are referring to our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unless the context indicates otherwise all amounts noted within the tables are in thousands and amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding overview our company we design manufacture and market a broad array of products that power protect and connect electronic circuits these products are primarily used in the networking telecommunications computing military aerospace transportation and broadcasting industries bels portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive medical and consumer electronics markets we operate through three geographic segments north america asia and europe in the three months ended march    of the companys revenues were derived from north america  from asia and  from its europe operating segment by product group  of sales for the three months ended march   related to the companys connectivity solutions products  in power solutions and protection products and  in magnetic products our operating expenses are driven principally by the cost of labor where the factories that bel uses are located the cost of the materials that we use and our ability to effectively and efficiently manage overhead costs as labor and material costs vary by product line and region any significant shift in product mix can have an associated impact on our costs of sales costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead our products are manufactured at various facilities in the us mexico dominican republic england czech republic slovakia and the prc in the prc where we generally enter into processing arrangements with several independent thirdparty contractors and also have our own manufacturing facilities the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual lunar new year holiday as well as economic conditions in the prc in addition we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and we can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products accordingly we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time these recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies and overtime required in order to meet demand can add volatility to the costs incurred by us for labor in the prc key factors affecting our business the company believes the key factors affecting bels results for the three months ended march   andor future results include the following � revenues the companys revenues for the three months ended march   decreased by  million or  as compared to the three months ended march   the decline experienced in the power solutions business throughout  accounted for  million of the decrease in sales in first quarter  sales compared to the first quarter of  lower sales through distribution partners and weakness in the industrial markets particularly in the oil and gas segment also contributed to the reduced sales volume in the first quarter on a sequential basis consolidated sales were down by  million compared to the fourth quarter of  largely due to the seasonal interruption related to the lunar new year holiday in the first quarter which impacts all of our product lines � product mix  material and labor costs vary by product line and any significant shift in product mix between higher and lowermargin product lines will have a corresponding impact on the companys gross margin percentage in general our connectivity products have the highest contribution margins our magnetic products are less profitable than the connectivity products and our power products are on the lower end of our profit margin range fluctuations in sales volume among our product groups will have a corresponding impact on bels profit margins return to index � impact of foreign currency  since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated financial results into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany transactions to and from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows the company monitors changes in foreign currencies and implements pricing actions to help mitigate the impact that changes in foreign currencies may have on its operating results see selling general and administrative expense below for further details � enterprise resource planning erp system implementation  we are currently engaged in a multiyear process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global erp system we currently estimate total costs over the next three years to be between  million to  million during the first quarter of  the company incurred  million of consulting costs in connection with this implementation which are included in sga in the condensed consolidated statement of operations we anticipate future expenses of approximately  million per quarter through the remainder of  see liquidity and capital resources

which we operate the us has the highest tax rates europes tax rates are generally lower than us tax rates and asia has the lowest tax rates of the companys three geographical segments while first quarter sales continued to decline both yearoveryear and sequentially from the fourth quarter of  we are encouraged by the upturn in our bookings during the first quarter across all of our product lines within the connectivity solutions group there were increased orders related to our rf and harsh environment optical products from military and distribution customers both in the us and europe on the power solutions and protection side there was a mild upswing in sales to customers that support datacenters and we expect growth in this product group in the second half of  as certain key projects move into full production in addition recent project wins in the emobility segment should have a favorable impact on sales beginning in  the preceding discussions represent forwardlooking

follows three months ended march    north america         asia       europe               the decline in north america sales noted above was primarily due to a  million reduction in power solutions

manufacturing services agreement this decline was partially offset by increases in sales of our acdc converter products of  million and our circuit protection products of  million in the first quarter of  as compared to the first quarter of  connectivity solutions the reduction in sales of connectivity solutions products in the first quarter of  primarily relate to lower demand for plugs and structured cabling within our stewart connector business approximately half of this decline is expected to be a permanent reduction due to consolidation within our customer base the remainder is
