plaintiffappellant v freds inc defendantappellee united states court of appeals sixth circuit february   not recommended for fulltext publication opinion mckeague circuit judge dollie ayers an africanamerican woman worked for freds inc for some  years in  she began dating willie jennings an area manager in the memphis warehouse where she worked jennings was not her direct supervisor but there could be times when she might be subject to his supervision ayers and jennings were married in july  when they returned to work from their honeymoon they were informed that one of them would have to resign because company policy prohibited any employee from working directly or indirectly under his or her spouse because her compensation was significantly less than her husbands dollie ayersjennings reluctantly resigned and brought suit under title vii alleging her termination pursuant to a policy that was not strictly enforced as to others was motivated by race discrimination plaintiff attempted to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination by showing that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably she offered evidence of three white employeecouples all of whom were allowed to keep working at freds after marriage freds moved for summary judgment contending the comparators were not similarly situated in all relevant respects the district court agreed the court held the evidence plaintiff relied on did not support an inference of race discrimination plaintiff was found not to have made out a prima facie case and freds motion for summary judgment was granted although plaintiffs termination was abrupt and resulted in unfortunate hardship the record evidence could not warrant a reasonable jury finding that race discrimination motivated her termination we therefore affirm the district courts summary judgment ruling i factual and procedural background dollie ayers began working at freds in  freds is a retail chain with its headquarters in memphis tennessee and stores across the southeastern united states in  ayers began dating her future husband willie jennings jennings was one of approximately ten area managers in the distribution center a freds warehouse in memphis ayers was a strategy control clerk that is a clerk who redirected misdirected merchandise within the same warehouse jennings was not ayerss direct supervisor but under the organizational structure in the warehouse divided into at least four areas it appears any warehouse employee could fall under the supervision of any area manager depending on the circumstances prior to their wedding both jennings and ayers mentioned their wedding plans to their supervisors none of whom cautioned them about the impact of their marriage on their employment status on july   when willie jennings and the now dollie ayersjennings returned from their honeymoon senior vice president reggie jacobs called them into his office jacobs had not been aware of their relationship and just learned of the newlyweds wedding the day they returned from their honeymoon he made the determination that this was a potential problem jacobs told them that their marriage brought them into violation of the companys nonfraternization policy and that one of them would have to resign there was no discussion at that time jacobs simply gave them twentyfour hours to talk it over and decide the nonfraternization policy referred to restricts relationships between coemployees where one would be in a position to supervise the other the policy includes the following pertinent provisions single management employees are not to date anyone they may directly or indirectly supervise because of the possible distractions at work single employees are discouraged but not prohibited from dating other single freds inc employees close relatives from immediate family through first cousins are not to be assigned to the same department nor are management employees to supervise close relatives exceptions may be approved by the president r  ex d nonfraternization policy no  also relevant is the policy concerning employment of relatives and friends of current employees which provides in pertinent part  no relative shall work in the same department except as approved in advance by the vice president of personnel  one relative is not placed under the supervision of another      should any two employees marry each other after working for the company while single there is no requirement under this policy that one of them resign however items  and  would be in effect r  ex i employment of relativesfriends of employees policy no  ayersjennings does not contend that she was unaware of these policies in fact she had signed a form on april   acknowledging that she had read and understood the standardsconduct policy which included notice that management personnel dating individuals whom they supervise is conduct that could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination r  ex e jennings later explained that he had never been dollies direct supervisor and he thought that they would just move one of us when we got married r  ex c jennings aff at ¶¶   freds made inquiry into the possibility of transferring ayersjennings to a different position where she would not be subject to the possibility of supervision by her husband however because all employees in the memphis warehouse were potentially subject to supervision by all area managers this meant that ayersjennings would have to be qualified for an entrylevel position in the corporate division inquiry was undertaken by jamie naughton senior vicepresident of human resources but no position for which ayersjennings was deemed qualified was available ie in the mail room or as a receptionist or accountspayable filing clerk faced with no good choice the couple reluctantly decided that ayersjennings would resign because jennings had the far greater income she was discharged on july   feeling that she was unfairly forced to resign plaintiff ayersjennings commenced this action in the western district of tennessee in september  asserting race discrimination claims under title vii  usc § e  usc §  and the tennessee human rights act tenn code ann §§  et seq on completion of discovery freds moved for summary judgment contending that plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination and in the alternative that she had failed to establish that freds facially legitimate reason for discharging her was pretextual the district court granted the motion on september   finding that plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination plaintiff timely appealed ii analysis a standard of review an order granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo white v baxter healthcare corp  fd   th cir  summary judgment should be rendered if the pleadings the discovery and disclosure materials on file and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law fed r civ p c the reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor white  fd at  not just any alleged factual dispute between the parties will defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the dispute must present a genuine issue of material fact id a dispute is genuine only if based on evidence upon which a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party niemi v nhk spring co ltd  fd   th cir  a factual dispute concerns a material fact only if its resolution might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law id at  b mcdonnell douglas framework the parties and the district court have treated all three of plaintiffs race discrimination claims as being governed by the same legal standards exemplified by the case law applicable to the title vii claim the parties also agree that there is no direct evidence of race discrimination and that plaintiffs circumstantial evidence must be evaluated under the burdenshifting framework prescribed in mcdonnell douglas corp v green  us   to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under title vii plaintiff must show that  she was a member of a protected class  she was discharged  she was qualified for the position and  she was replaced by a person outside the protected class or treated differently than similarly situated nonprotected employees id at  russell v univ of toledo  fd   th cir  if plaintiff makes this showing the burden shifts to freds to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for having terminated plaintiff mcdonnell douglas  us at  if freds meets this requirement the final burden of persuasion rests with plaintiff to show that the proffered reason is actually a pretext for unlawful discrimination plaintiff can carry this burden by showing that the stated reason for termination  has no basis in fact  was not the actual reason or  is insufficient to explain the employers action white  fd at  in applying this framework in the context of a motion for summary judgment the question at each stage of the analysis is whether the party with the burden of production has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact provenzano v lci holdings inc  fd   th cir  plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion that she was the victim of race discrimination id at  c prima facie case the district court concluded that plaintiff failed to meet the fourth element of her prima facie case that is plaintiff failed to show that nonprotected similarly situated employees were treated more favorably than she was specifically the district court held that the three comparable employeecouples relied on by plaintiff were not similarly situated in all relevant respects to support an inference of unlawful discrimination comparable nonminority employees who received more favorable treatment than plaintiff must be shown to be similarly situated in all relevant respects ercegovich v goodyear tire  rubber co  fd   th cir  plaintiff need not demonstrate an exact correlation with the asserted comparable employees receiving more favorable treatment in order for them to be considered similarly situated id in mitchell v toledo hosp  fd   th cir  the court held that to be deemed similarlysituated the individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare hisher treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employers treatment of them for it in ercegovich the court acknowledged that the factors considered in mitchell are generally relevant but explained that an independent determination of relevant aspects of employment status must be considered in each case  fd at  the factors considered in mitchell are only apposite where they are meaningful to the particular claim of discrimination presented bobo v united parcel serv inc — fd — no   wl  at  th cir jan    jay  angel easterling jay and angel easterling are the most similarly situated comparable employees jay and angel—who are both white—worked in the imports department of freds corporate division where angel was jays direct supervisor—before they were married it is undisputed that employees in both the corporate division and the warehouse division were subject to the same nonfraternization policy in  before they were married jay advised alan crockett vice president of finance that he and angel wanted to begin a relationship crockett then approached jamie naughton senior vice president of human resources to seek approval of jays transfer to the inventory department where he would not be subject to angels supervision naughton confirmed that jay was qualified for the transfer and approved it so that angel would no longer be his direct supervisor this was accomplished before jay and angel were married plaintiff contends the easterlings received more favorable treatment though they were similarly situated in all relevant respects they were both employed by freds they became romantically involved and got married and freds allowed both of them to continue their employment despite their marriage as naughton approved jays transfer to a department where he would not be supervised by angel freds contends the easterlings situation is materially distinguishable in that jay was never in a position where he was subject to angels supervision after they got married and naughton approved jays transfer to an available position outside of angels supervision for which he was qualified plaintiff does not argue that jay was unqualified for the position to which he was transferred nor does she argue that there was any available position in the corporate division for which she was qualified neither does she contend that she or jennings like jay easterling ever requested a transfer or other accommodation before or after their marriage nonetheless plaintiff contends the easterlings were sufficiently similarly situated to support an inference of race discrimination freds contends that plaintiff ignores critical differences arguing that unlike plaintiff none of plaintiffs comparators were warehouse workers where under freds organizational structure every laborer is subject to supervision direct or indirect by any manager none of plaintiffs comparators were subject to supervision by reggie jacobs the stickler for company policy who enforced the nonfraternization policy in plaintiffs case and none of the comparators presented a situation where one spouse was in a position to manage the other in response to the first and third of these points plaintiff contends that the possibility that her husband could be in a position to supervise her in the warehouse after their marriage should not be deemed significant insisting there is no evidence that he ever directly supervised her before their marriage yet plaintiff has not offered any evidence refuting reggie jacobs explanation of freds organizational structure there are two separate and distinct divisions within freds one is the corporate division which is divided into professional work groups employees are hired into a specific work group based on their professional work experience and educational level including university level areas of study the other division is the warehouse division which is a labor based workforce and freds crosstrains employees and managers to be able to work in all areas of the warehouse if the need arises the corporate division does not crosstrain the professionals to work in other groups because of the specialized nature of the workgroup subdivisions in the corporate division warehouse managers and employees receive crosstraining in all warehouse areas so each area can be properly staffed and managers can cover all areas when necessary the warehouse division handles nearly all of the products stocked at freds retail stores and it is essential that employees be able to work in all areas of the warehouse when a need arises likewise warehouse managers must be able to manage in all warehouse areas when a need arises because of this structure it is highly likely that each employee will come under the supervision of each of the managers at some time because the corporate division and the warehouse division are separate and distinct divisions warehouse supervisors do not have managerial control over an employee in the corporate division r  ex a jacobs aff at ¶¶  considering this undisputed organizational structure plaintiffs argument that the possibility of her coming under the supervision of her husband was insignificant amounts to nothing more than a challenge to freds business judgment such a challenge is relevant only if the circumstances give rise to an inference of unlawful discriminatory motive see ladd v grand trunk western rr inc  fd   th cir  we look to similarly situated employees not to evaluate the employers business judgment but to inquire into the employers motivation and intent to determine whether the employer was motivated by discrimination quoting wrenn v gould  fd   th cir  here however there is no hint that freds decision to enforce its nonfraternization policy after plaintiff and jennings were married was motivated by race discrimination there is no evidence that freds had ever allowed married employeecouples of any race or color to continue employment in the warehouse or corporate division under circumstances where one was subject to the possibility of supervision by the other as to the second point above plaintiff does not dispute the contention that none of her comparators were subject to supervision by reggie jacobs but she contends that jamie naughton played a role in both the discontinuation of her employment and the continuation of jay easterlings employment whereas naughton approved jays transfer to another department to save his employment naughton did not approve plaintiffs transfer resulting in her termination however even if naughton is accepted as having played a decisive role in both situations plaintiff does not dispute that on the one hand jay was qualified for an available position in a department where he would not be supervised by his wife and on the other hand there was no available position within plaintiffs qualifications to which she could be transferred to avoid supervision by her husband again the record simply does not support an inference that naughtons facially different treatment of the two situations was motivated by race discrimination accordingly the district court did not err in determining that the easterlings were not similarly situated in all relevant respects  ralph  lenora hickman the second asserted comparable employeecouple are ralph and lenora hickman who were both employed by freds for some twelve years after they were married lenora has been employed by freds for some  years she has held various managementlevel positions in the distribution center warehouse her former husband ralph they were divorced three years ago has worked for freds exclusively in the corporate division for  years plaintiff does not contest freds assertion that neither lenora nor ralph ever worked under the supervision of the other spouse instead she argues ineffectually that both of them worked for a period of seven years during which jamie naughton occupied the position of senior vice president for human resources and never raised any concern about their marriage plaintiff has made no showing that either lenora or ralph or their marriage ever violated the nonfraternization policy in fact lenora once applied for a position in the merchandising department where her husband worked in the corporate division she was told she was not eligible for the position because her husband worked there and she could be subject to supervision by her husband if she were awarded the position in other words the hickmans were not treated any more favorably under the nonfraternization policy than were plaintiff and her husband the hickmans have not been shown to be similarly situated in any way that would support an inference that plaintiffs termination was motivated by race discrimination  reggie  leigh ann jacobs the third comparable employeecouple is reggie and leigh ann jacobs they are similarly situated to the hickmans that is they too are longterm married employees of freds one of whom has worked in the warehouse reggie and one of whom has worked in the corporate division leigh ann neither was ever in a position to supervise the other there is no evidence that they ever ran afoul of the nonfraternization policy they offer little support for plaintiffs claim accordingly it is apparent that the district court did not err in holding that plaintiff had not satisfied the fourth required element of her prima facie case plaintiffs evidence that comparable white employeecouples received more favorable treatment from freds than she and her husband has little probative value because none of the comparators are similarly situated in all relevant respects because of the patent and material dissimilarities between plaintiffs situation and those of her comparators the fact that freds allowed each of the comparable employeecouples to continue their employment after they were married simply does not give rise to a reasonable inference that the less favorable treatment received by plaintiff was motivated by race discrimination plaintiff has thus failed to show error in the district courts ruling that she failed to meet the requirements of her prima facie case iii conclusion no reasonable person would disagree that plaintiff deserved better a good loyal employee of some  years was given  hours to decide whether she or her husband would resign—not because of misconduct of any kind—but because of a blessed event their matrimonial union a cruel irony indeed yet though we fail to understand such inflexible adherence to company policy the civil rights laws do not give the courts license to micromanage the workplace in the absence of evidence of unlawful discrimination a reason is legitimate for purposes of the civil rights laws if it is nondiscriminatory even if it is meanspirited illconsidered inconsistent with humane personnel policies or otherwise objectionable galbraith v n telecom inc  fd   th cir  overruled on other grounds kline v tenn valley auth  fd  th cir  because plaintiff was unable to establish her prima facie case under the mcdonnell douglas framework the district courts award of summary judgment to freds was not improper and the judgment is hereby affirmed footnotes  honorable michael r barrett united states district judge for the southern district of ohio sitting by designation  jacobs was the senior vicepresident of distribution and transportation overseeing all warehouse operations he was known to be a stickler for company policy in jacobs own words as both a senior vice president and as an executive vice president i take my responsibilities seriously and strictly enforce freds rules and policies to maintain continuity and order for the employees and supervisors under my management and control r  ex a jacobs aff at ¶   the prospect of transferring jennings to freds second warehouse building in memphis was not considered because it would not have fixed the problem since warehouse managers moved freely between the neighboring buildings in memphis r  ex b jacobs dep at  r  ex b jacobs dep at  the possibility of transferring jennings to freds warehouse facility in dublin georgia was not explored nor is there any suggestion that the couple requested such consideration or that there was an opening in that facility  there is no dispute that plaintiff is a member of a protected group satisfying the first element for purposes of the motion for summary judgment freds conceded that plaintiffs resignation represented a cognizable adverse employment action satisfying the second element as to the third element freds argued below that although plaintiff had undisputably been a good employee for a long time she had ceased to be qualified for her position when she married jennings who could potentially be her supervisor giving rise to a violation of the nonfraternization policy the district court held that a reasonable jury could conclude that the wedding did not render ayersjennings unqualified for her position but only brought jennings as a manager into violation of the policy r  district court order at  freds has not challenged this determination on appeal hence the only issue presented on appeal concerns the fourth element and whether plaintiff presented sufficient evidence that she was treated differently than other employees not in her protected group  the record is ambiguous in relation to whether jay and angel were permitted to begin their relationship at a time when they worked in the same department of the corporate division before he was transferred but even if the answer to this question were deemed to be yes this would not show that jay and angel received more favorable treatment than plaintiff and jennings plaintiff and jennings too were permitted to work together in the warehouse while they were in a relationship for some nine months see r  ex b jacobs dep at   explaining that he jacobs was unaware of plaintiffs and jennings relationship before they were married and that he did not make it a point to inquire on a regular basis of the dating practices or relationships of the employees in the dc it was thus plaintiffs marriage to jennings while still under his indirect supervision that precipitated the adverse treatment she received id at  jay on the other hand had been transferred away from angels department some time before they married hence again the fact that jay and angel may have started a relationship before he was transferred does not support an inference of race discrimination comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right
