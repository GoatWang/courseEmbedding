regarding the bank’s q results “core operating trends were reasonably strong during the second quarter in a business environment that continues to be challenging average quarterly portfolio balances declined on lower offbalance sheet portfolio balances with strong loan disbursement growth offset by prepayments but lending margins remained at robust levels reinforcing the bank’s earnings generation capacity top line revenues aided by solid fee income growth were higher both on a quarteronquarter and yeartodate basis our origination is well diversified across the region and the short duration of our exposures allows the bank to proactively adjust the portfolio mix according to the prevailing market conditions this quarter saw us continuing to shrink the exposure profile in brazil not just in relative but also in absolute terms as the recessionary trend continues in that country while partially compensating with growth in other parts of the region we also increased our efforts to steer origination towards shortterm trade exposures which represent higher quality risk albeit at lower margins we are convinced this emphasis is conducive to asset growth during the remainder of the year and accelerates our focus on ensuring better overall returns deploying our capital more efficiently          as we continue to face disparate growth patterns and overall higher levels of volatility in the markets it is not surprising to see an increase in liability restructuring negotiations and workout arrangements sought by debtors over the last few quarters and we are working diligently to mitigate the impact from these adverse market conditions in certain countries and industry sectors for these clients while the number and amount of these exposures remain relatively small in relation to the overall portfolio we do take them very seriously nonetheless as the size nature and relative importance of these debtors in their respective market segments require close coordination with multiple creditors on the backdrop of strong core business performance for the year so far we have strengthened reserves significantly this quarter to reflect the more advanced stages of delinquency in these few cases due to complex and thus protracted negotiations with the debtors we believe the reserve levels accurately reflect the expected outcomes of ongoing restructuring and recovery efforts but stand ready to adjust these levels should expectations be revised upwards or downwards as efforts progress meanwhile the workout arrangements concluded in prior quarters continue to perform even better as anticipated as underlying commodity prices stabilized in hardhit sectors such as oil  gas and sugar   while commission income from the letters of credit business remained stable albeit below historical levels this quarter on account of limited demand from importers in the southern cone and andean regions the pickup of fee income in our structuring and syndication business did materialize as previously anticipated with a number of successfully concluded transactions to which we have already added another completed transaction early in the third quarter the pipeline of mandated structured transactions continues to look strong and we maintain our positive outlook for the remainder of the year for this line of business   bladex has reached a scale in business operations and efficiency that allows the bank to absorb the effects of a challenging business environment while still maintaining profitability and returns additionally the exit from the participation in investment funds early in this quarter has removed a significant element of market risk volatility allowing us to squarely focus on what we know best – credit risk our diversified portfolio approach not only allows us to mitigate the impacts of current market conditions but also to take advantage of them and we are determined to keep the course in the coming quarters” mr amaral concluded   results by business segment the bank’s activities are managed and executed in two business segments commercial and treasury the business segment results are determined based on the bank’s managerial accounting process as defined by ifrs  – operating segments which assigns consolidated statement of financial positions revenue and expense items to each business segment on a systemic basis          commercial business segment the commercial business segment encompasses the bank’s core business of financial intermediation and fee generation activities relating

credit guarantees and loan commitments and through loan structuring and syndication activities iii gain on sale of loans generated by other loan intermediation activities such as sales in the

expenses   the commercial portfolio includes gross loans at amortized cost customers’ liabilities under acceptances offbalance sheet instruments such as confirmed and standby letters of credit credit commitments and guarantees covering commercial risk and an equity investment   as of june   the commercial portfolio balances stood at  billion  lower compared to  billion a quarter ago and  lower versus  billion a year ago as offbalance sheet portfolio balances decreased and increased loan disbursements were largely offset by prepayments during the quarter while net lending margins remained at robust levels supporting income generation the bank accelerated its emphasis on origination of shortterm trade finance exposures together with reducing certain country industry and client risk concentrations on an average basis commercial portfolio balances reached  billion in the first m down  compared to the  billion during the same period  while q average balance was  billion down  from
