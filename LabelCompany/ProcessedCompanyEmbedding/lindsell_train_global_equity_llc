funds have a single price at which the fund can be bought and sold for dual priced funds the difference between the buy and sell price is made up of the initial charge and other costs eg the fund managers dealing costs the initial saving from hl will reduce the buying price but even with a full discount the buying price may still be higher than the selling price for single priced funds the price quoted does not include the initial charge any initial charge after deduction of the initial saving from hl will be added to the price quoted please note that even where a full saving is offered

the long term by investing in a concentrated portfolio of global equities primarily those listed in developed countries despite the focus on developed markets the managers believe that a companys location can be irrelevant given the increasing level of globalisation the managers look for durable cashgenerative businesses that will still be profitably in business in  years’ time a sustainable high return on equity and low capital intensity are important fundamentals in identifying potential buys before the managers calculate an intrinsic value relative to the share price they believe that companies that are properly researched along these criteria offer relatively low risk therefore they form a highly concentrated portfolio this will typically be focused on consumer franchises but will also include owners of intellectual property and marketplaces stock turnover is very low as the managers are relatively insensitive to changes in valuation considering the quality of the business more
