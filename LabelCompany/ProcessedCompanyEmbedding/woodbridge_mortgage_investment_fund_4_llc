position commercial mortgage fpcm is a simple safer and more secured opportunity for individuals to achieve their financial objectives this private thirdparty loan to woodbridge provides higher returns with shorter terms secured by commercial real estate private lenders – with expert guidance and insight from us – select a commercial mortgage in woodbridge’s inventory to serve as collateral for their private loan they are recorded on title and acquire a first lien position on the mortgage and every lender is paid monthly interest from the moment they partner with woodbridge at a fixed annual  return with a return of principal at the end of the oneyear term why are they called first position commercial mortgages the phrase “first position commercial mortgage” describes the collateral pledged by woodbridge as security for the loan you are making as a private lender you select a particular commercial mortgage from woodbridge’s inventory – with expert guidance and insight from us – to serve as collateral for your loan to woodbridge a first position commercial mortgage loan is not a mortgage investment pool and it is not a direct investment in real estate they are also referred to as first trust deed loans or senior interest position mortgages what is a first position in a commercial mortgage if you have a first position that means you have priority over any other liens or claims on a property if the property owner defaults it puts you in control as a commercial mortgage lender woodbridge executes only first mortgage transactions with commercial borrowers ensuring we hold the first lien on the property with interest rates so low why do borrowers come to woodbridge in today’s lending environment real estate developers and commercial borrowers are seeking out alternative financing that they can receive in  to  weeks which woodbridge provides by partnering with lenders like you we offer shortterm bridge loans to commercial property owners based on the value of their property the borrowers qualify for our mortgages because they are secured by the high value commercial assets what types of property are used as collateral in these transactions generally woodbridge secures these mortgages with commercial real estate such as multiunit apartments office buildings retail centers or mixeduse developments though we will sometimes accept as collateral nonowner occupied singlefamily homes that are held as investment properties and owned by a corporation or limited liability company what are some of the terms of the mortgage given to the borrower our commercial mortgage lending policies dictate that we lend for a maximum loan term of two years and up to only  percent of the value of the real estate that means the properties that secure the mortgages are worth considerably more than the loans themselves at closing what type of due diligence does woodbridge perform on these properties woodbridge performs a rigorous title search to ensure first lien position and thoroughly evaluates each property by conducting a comprehensive appraisal to confirm market value are the properties insured woodbridge obtains insurance coverage on the encumbered property this mitigates the risk of loss to the property’s value due to damage destruction natural disasters earthquake flood tornado hurricane mudslide and the like what is a lender’s collateral with loantovalue ratios of  or less the property’s equity is your collateral   what is the paperwork required to get started when you lend on a first position commercial mortgage you enter

has no additional liens woodbridge conducts a rigorous title search for each property to ensure that the property is free of liens we pay off any existing lienholders when entering into a transaction with a borrower so there are no additional liens on the property   how do i verify that i hold a first lien position in the mortgage upon request woodbridge will provide you with a copy of the title policy which indicates there are no other liens or claims above you no exceptions   will my name appear on the land records of the property yes woodbridge executes and delivers the first lien position documents in your name and files the documentation on the land records in the relevant jurisdiction   does the borrower make payments to me no woodbridge is contractually obligated to make your monthly interest payments and return the principal at the end of the term regardless of the status of the underlying loan   what happens if the borrower does not make payments or defaults first position commercial mortgages are private transactions that are separate and distinct from the pledged collateral if a commercial borrower does not make its payments to woodbridge or defaults woodbridge remains obligated and shall continue to pay your monthly interest payments and return your principal at the end of the term according to the terms of your promissory note and loan agreement
