year cheyne capital social property fund looks to tap pensions demand for inflationlinked cashflows stuart fiertz cheyne capital risknet staff riskdotnet  dec  tweet   facebook   linkedin   save this article send to   print this page   buyside awards  on the face of it difficulties in property development state funding social care and stresses in the inflation swaps market might seem unlikely to find a common solution but cheyne capital thinks such a solution exists and the londonbased hedge fund manager has put together a fund to invest £ million  million pursuing that idea cheynes social property impact fund – for which firstround fundraising completed in may – will buy or build properties suitable for disadvantaged groups or the elderly and lease them to councils or care providers at inflationlinked rates its an initiative that has carried the londonbased fund manager into the orbit of politics – presenting at a recent parliamentary conference on alternative finance for example but the motivation is more than simply doing good – or being seen to do so the opportunity set is at least £ billion estimates stuart fiertz cheynes cofounder president and director of research we see this as an integral and differentiated leg of what we do our real estate debt business today is about  billion in assets under management our credit business is about  billion the nearterm objective is to get the social housing to be about a  billion business cheynes fund is aiming to tap frustrated institutional demand for inflationlinked cashflows – a postcrisis dislocation it hopes to benefit from and contribute towards fixing weve watched how well infrastructure companies such as hicl infrastructure have been trading every time they look to raise more money the market accepts it fiertz says that tells you there is huge demand for inflationlinked assets increased demand cheyne sees that demand intensifying partly owing to new margining rules related to swaps coming into effect between now and september  which will force pension funds to post variation margin against longterm swaps thats an additional cost if you are getting your inflation through swaps fiertz says at the same time some pension funds feel less at ease postcrisis facing bank counterparties on derivatives contracts lasting  or  years the alternative – the way to get inflation without the counterparty risk and without the need to put up collateral – is to buy inflation linked assets fiertz says but uk linkers are strongly bid today and they became even more strongly bid after the uk referendum vote you look at the real yield on linkers and it is negative  on a year bond in our view the next phase for the market is to buy inflation embedded in either a security or an asset if only half of the social housing demand is met through new building we are talking about  housing units that gives you a £ billion investment opportunity stuart fiertz cheyne capital thats what cheynes fund offers terms on the leases underlying the fund will typically be linked to consumer price index inflation – making for current yields in excess of  on costs its a  basis point pickup over gilts and we think that is generous giving the credit quality of our tenants fiertz says the fund is twothirds leveraged to boost both returns and its inflation sensitivity making the latter above  cheyne is targeting a levered  to  return net of fees for the fund for investors the numbers behind the strategy are compelling uk home supply is trailing demand with  million families in the queue for social housing according to the uks department of communities and local government building rates – at  units a year – are well below yearly demand growth of about  units an annual £ billion government grant to housing associations against which they would borrow about the same again was cut to around £ million by the coalition government in june  and has stayed there since meanwhile social care providers face rising calls for assistedliving nursing and care home places as the population ages the overs and overs are the fastest growing segment of the national demographic fiertz points out strategic partnership so far the fund has built  one and twobedroom flats in luton is building  affordable homes in sheffield and has completed a strategic partnership – with developer kier lloyds banking group and the uk homes and communities agency – to build a further £ billion of housing for councils over the coming five years about half the investors are pension funds the remainder mainly insurers and sovereign wealth funds half are based in the uk and the rest in europe north america and australia if only half of the social housing demand is met through new building we are talking about  housing units fiertz says that gives you a £ billion investment opportunity thats not accounting for social carerelated development cheyne plans to launch a second fund and says it has interest already from institutions in japan and the middle east the firm also intends in future to issue inflationlinked notes itself if we borrow on a nominal basis we generate a leveraged inflation exposure but pay slightly more for that leverage as an alternative the firm can secure cheaper leverage by issuing inflationlinked bonds that way the fund would pass through one turn of inflation to bondholders but retain exposure to at least one times inflation while generating a higher real yield its been a solid year for cheyne fiertz says he is pleased with performance in the firms credit funds over the past  months given spreads have moved little and rates have risen recently and in the real estate markets the firm believes it has navigated postbrexit vote turbulence successfully he says wed been cautious in avoiding cyclical parts of the market such as offices and highend residential properties and had focused on sectors driven by secular trends he says and weve been well positioned to take advantage of the further retraction of bank lending after the referendum cheynes total return credit fund is up more than  for the year to september its real estate credit holdings fund is up close to
