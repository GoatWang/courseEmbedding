accessories accessories technology philosophy outdoor pros design methodology our name the crew mzs views the outdoor industry has changed since the early days back then people worked at and owned the companies they founded everyone involved was equally passionate about making the best products possible goals were driven by the lust for great gear solid connections and likeminded people we have seen many of the companies we once respected for delivering kickass gear devolve into less passionate more financedriven corporate entities the methodology at slingfin is design and quality driven the end goal is to bring to market the most welldesigned and highest quality outdoor products ever created for the most serious users in the world utilizing our innovative designs the best materials available and extensive research through handson product testing we make sure our gear is tested under the harshest conditions to ensure a quality and trustworthy product there is no such thing as bad weather only bad gear – masta db the heaviest tent in the world is a lightweight tent that failed – phil scott tents are tensile structures tensile structures are formed with tension and compression members the pure form of tensile structures can be seen with tensegrity structures where tension members wires and compression members struts operate simultaneously for the structure to hold its shape please see tensegritycom if any single strut or tension member fails the whole structure is weakened and can even fail completely individual parts must work together to maintain strength and stability the same is true for tents any failure in a tension member fabric or compression member tent poles results in a weakened or even failed structure liken tents to chains where any weak link may render the whole chain unusable designing a tent where all components are equally strong is a tremendous challenge but is the key ingredient to making a tent or structure as strong as possible many companies attach webbing with a tensile strength of  pounds to a tent using fabric with a tensile strength of  pounds this is not an efficient use or resources because the tent is either out of balance being either heavier than it needs to be or not as strong as it could be using ingredients that are proportionately strong will create the strongest tent for the least amount of weight and when youre out on the trail the last thing you need is a broken tent at slingfin we put design and efficiency at top of our priorities because our team of hardworking outdoor enthusiasts and gear junkies know just how important it is to be able to trust your tent for every mile you spend on the trail steff zurek designed our logo with help from jonathan buck and martin zemitis steff came up with dozens of design concepts and we chose one very similar to our current logo something about the way the tips of the fins joined together at the center made it look unfinished jonathan suggested that we just spread the fins apart so they are no longer joined at the center steff took the new concept and delivered our final and official logo the process took place over  weeks steff zurek is an artist and graphic designer who works in the san francisco bay area where did the name slingfin come from the short story sling refers to a climbing sling a loop of nylon or dyneema with multiple applications and fin refers to the fin from a fish or rock formation founder martin zemitis wanted a name that represented gear made for use on land and in the water the long story per martin i started purchasing domain names in the late s i would register domain names i liked or thought i would have use for in the future i registered the domain names tentdesigncom tentblogcom geodesicdomescom tensegritycom expeditionblogcom mountainblogcom and many others over the years one weekend i spent a few hours looking for climbing related domain names and while searching slingcom and climbingslingcom i stumbled across wwwslingfincom i worked at mountain hardwear for nearly  years before i decided it was time to head out on my own in  i rented a beautiful loft in richmond about  yards away from mountain hardwares original location  central avenue prior to moving to the ford point building in richmond california i moved my parts library industrial sewing machines fabrics materials machinery and design tools into the loft the loft had windows on all sides and a gorgeous wood floor the property owners european sleepworks wwweuropeansleepworkscom were very generous and best of all quiet i was free to design and work on whatever i wanted to no product managers bosses and best of all no interruptions few people knew what i was up to and for  months i spent all my time designing tents sleeping bags clothing and packs i came up with the webtruss™ design and exopak technology during my design time in the loft i used the name expedition technology wwwexpeditiontechnologycom for nearly a year but deep down i knew the name had to be slingfin meet the slingfin crew martin zemitis — founderdesignergearhead martin is widely known as one of the best tent designers in the business as a  year

a computer cad system he couldnt beat lauren herrera sky planning and systems project management lauren alexander  public relations social media  slingfin start written by mz i started in this industry in  with my brother cedrik zemitis bill sterling and bonnie jerome we rented an industrial sewing machine and i started making patterns and sewing products used by backpackers and crosscountry skiers it was easy to come up with new product designs since we were backpacking and crosscountry skiing every chance we got we made used and sold the gear we started from the ground up and got our hands dirty i learned to cut sew and make sample patterns production patterns markers repair sewing machines and much more the learning curve was steep but fun and rewarding i loved finding solutions to design problems which led me to become a designer and later an inventor in the early days most of the backpacking companies focused on the equipment side of the business such as packs sleeping bags accessories and tents clothing was in the mix but was seen as equipment in the early days down jackets were not fashion items — they were tools just like down sleeping bags both were a necessary part of everyones gear list companies grew and realized there was a much larger market for clothing instead of equipment though and slowly equipment became an ever decreasing percentage of the business total as compared to clothing clothing added a whole new level of complexity to the business so most companies split responsibilities between equipment and clothing company owners were still working at the companies they founded and there was pride taken in the quality of their products as the industry continued to grow and mature the dollars got larger and product managers with pure business backgrounds took over with the mission to grow their businesses as money rolled in the game changed and became more serious the economies of scale and capital resources allowed the larger companies to produce products offshore which helped them grow even faster the industry went through several phases of consolidation with many of the smaller brands being assimilated into larger organizations brands such as holubar and others eventually began to disappear altogether the important point here is the shift product managers with pure business backgrounds were hired to to manage the design process most of these managers knew numbers marketing product position and sales but few know of the details that go into making great gear their focus became to increase sales by selling products to a larger market through expanded distribution product managers are looking at the leisure trend numbers so they know what to tell their design department to create for the next season for a forward looking designer this is not a creative way to approach a piece of gear companies began using lower quality fabrics raw materials and second rate factories to make products that meet price points compelling to retail store buyers this cutrate approach leaves serious users confused and disappointed since products are no longer well made so more time is spent on the phone dealing with warranty departments the customer is not happy if the product fails three days into a  day patagonia trekking trip to meet these everlower price points companies are using less experienced lower quality factories and raw materials for example high end tent brands would never have considered using a nylon  fabric  years ago to meet these price points product managers and retail store buyers want nylon  instead of nylon  take it one step further and consider that nylon fabrics are more expensive compared to polyester fabrics many manufacturers are now making their tents using polyester because these are less expensive than even nylon  using the very lowest quality fabrics will help the product managers meet their price targets but the products will not stand up to the marketing hype put out by the company  days of uv exposure is about the most you can hope for from the average tent these days we have decided to get off that train and head down a new path which really is the old path that the industry was founded on  making great gear for backpackers and mountaineers making great gear is easy if you have the balls to do it and you know how you cut out the product manager who does not know how to make anything and solve design problems instead of filling product slots for the retail buyers positioning strategies we started slingfin to make quality gear for professional users this means we are positioning ourselves at the top of the user pyramid these are professional users guides outfitters expedition users and gear junkies who crave only the best we design and build tools which help these users accomplish their objectives this is a tiny segment of the market and not one that will excite the average retailer its not even a market which is economically viable in the long term but it is the right place to start it is however an often overlooked and critical part of the market the users at the top of the pyramid are the ones that can give the feedback needed to produce great gear they are the ones that help define what the problems are so the designers can work on solving the problems i have learned something interesting over the years working with professional guides if they return a piece of gear that is in tatters what most people would consider a trashed piece of gear which should be recycled or discarded and they want you to fix it then you know you have succeeded if you never hear from them again after giving them a product then you know they are not interested in it its a rather dysfunctional means of communication but that has been my observation over the last  years in the industry there are guides and outfitters that are willing to work with you if you are willing to listen and learn from them that is something i have always done since its the long term users who know what works and what does not i have had the privilege to work with many great mountaineers ed viesturs eric simonson robert link babu chiri sherpa david breashears and many more i feel a great amount of respect for sherpas since they are many of the best mountaineers in the world babu chiri sherpa is an example of one of the best and strongest climbers ever i learned a lot from babu and his sherpa friends they see and use gear from all over the world and they know better than most what works and what does not work in some of the most inhospitable places and conditions on the planet the way you make quality outdoor gear is the way you make any quality product you find like minded people who love gear and have a passion for making it there are factories and raw goods suppliers who are passionate about making quality products as well the trick is to know who they are and to set the ground rules when you start working with them generally us manufacturers love to improve the quality of their products as the product cycle matures companies build their brand and improve their reputation which allows them to charge a premium for their products the price goes up as more features improvements and models are introduced asian factories in order to win the contract bid very low which means they have a very thin margin the factories are betting they can increase their margin by lowering their costs over time they do this by squeezing their suppliers and employees in asia from the day you get a price quote the factory and all the suppliers are trying to figure out how to lower their costs and increase their margins this means that from day one the quality of the products steadily decreases as factories try to reduce costs you have to either own a manufacturing facility or know how to work with contract factories to understand how to make quality gear paying for quality fabrics alone will not get the results you are trying to achieve when it comes to making quality gear we work with factories that do not play by the asian pricing strategies what else makes a great company people to make quality gear you need to bring people together who are passionate about gear phil scott for example has been in the industry since the s he has worked for every name brand outdoor company in california he is one of the few people i know other than marty kaiser and mark erickson that can design clothing sleeping bags tents and packs while phil is a designer his real specialties are cutting making production patterns markers grading his sewing is rather crude but he does know how to sew better than most people he has been designing and making gear for nearly  years he knows what works and is constantly making improvements to his products he is an old fashioned craftsman who loves gear phil has been banned for life from participating in any marketing or product naming sessions his dislike and contempt for marketing is only rivaled by his dislike of poor design fabrics or craftsmanship phil is working in our skunk works on clothing as is susan smith a former design room manager and product engineer for the north face and other bay area outdoor companies over the last  years tim baka is a harvard mba and was mountain hardwears numbers guy until the companys sale to columbia in  he put together the business plan for the hardwear along with jack gilbert while his first jobs were as an investment banker tim and his wife dora have spent the last  years in hong kong working in organic cotton garment and fabric manufacturing tim has visited and worked with more textile mills and sewing factories than anyone i know while we are working on clothing sleeping bags and packs our initial products are tents equipment has historically been the foundation of any authentic brand in the outdoor industry tents often separate the creative brands from the others the world sees your company logo in some off the craziest places on earth any company in the rag trade can make a garment but only a handful of companies can make a tent that can withstand  meter conditions with less than  pounds of aluminum and fabric slingfin has no formal marketing department other than a keg of beer and a jockey box full of ice and some very creative minds we have  industrial sewing machines used for sample making the support of our vendors that we have been working with for over  years and people who are passionate about making great gear what we do is build gear like others in our industry used to but this time with people who have more experience than those who did in the s – martin zemitis  slingfincom slingfin  home menu slingfincom × home tents tent accessories accessories

reviews vote up  vote down the slingfin crossbow  rs is the solid bodied ripstop… november   updated nov   sean van cleve  reviewer rep guideoutfitter top  reviewer review corps rating source received for testing via the trailspace review corps samples provided by slingfin for testing and review summary the slingfin crossbow  rs is the solid bodied ripstop fourseason tent in the crossbow  family two backpackers and all of their gear can comfortably wait out the storm without being cramped this tent is ideal for a backpacking duo that does not want to compromise shelter strength in cold weather conditions not every new tent builder has more experience than the big dogs… pros very comfortable for two people extremely spacious vestibules good strengthtoweight ratio excellent quality of materials cons not dry pitchdry breakdown learning curve high price point a quiet afternoon in the forest all to myself although slingfin may be a relatively new name to the tent world the crew on board has more collective experience than most well established companies it is clear that they have paid very close attention to the needs of users who camp in adverse conditions this being said this tent could be overkill for many hikers out there this tent configuration is designed specifically for cold weather environments which has been quite lacking this autumn in the midatlantic east coast region specs msrp  capacity  person number of doors  number of vestibules  interior area  sq ft vestibule area sq ft x interior height ” at center fabric d nylon ripstop pu coated floor             d canopy fabric             d nylon ripstop silicone pu coated fly poles x dac nsl mm main poles            x dac nsl mm bow pole min trail weight lbs oz without footprint setup this shelter takes a good bit of time to learn for proper setup after a couple of uses the crossbow  rs became intuitive to setup after staking the four corners of the shelter the two main tent poles slide through the webtruss and are inserted into grommets much like most tents  the rainfly can then be installed which was shown to be problematic when breaking camp in the pouring rain removing the tent poles from the gusset can be troublesome especially when every moment counts during a rainstorm i broke the tent down during a rainstorm working as carefully as possible to keep the tent dry unfortunately the tent poles were being extremely finicky coming out of their sleeves unfortunately there wasn’t an opportunity to snap any shots at the time… the top bow pole is optional if the user chooses to attach trekking poles as the secondary support system weight savings oz the guylines are all included with clam cleats which have become a standard in the industry over the last several years  rainfly installation is easy with special reflective tabs that indicate the correct opening in respect to the doorway to the tent stability all configurations of the slingfin crossbow  have shown to be among the most stable tents i have ever used the strongest winds encountered during testing were only in the  mph range and this tent did not budge this tent will easily handle far higher winds weather resistance the rs performed extremely well in one downpour during testing the rainfly keeps the entire tent inner dry as well as the two giant vestibules the bathtub bottom of this shelter successfully prevented any splash back  ventilation the rs has shown to ventilate extremely well in cold weather and rain over a fourday trip to the cranberry wilderness in southern monongahela national forest in west virginia in november though wind was light no condensation was noted whatsoever the entire trip with both vestibules closed the rainfly is designed for maximum crossventilation two doors aid in superb ventilation   room  storage the useable space for the size and weight of this shelter is truly great most of my testing was either solo or with my pup and this tent is palatial even with two larger people in this tent the vestibules will hold packs boots trekking poles water bottles and more packability for the size of this shelter packability is a plus the d and d material really does an admirable job packing down ease of use once the system is understood the crossbow  is relatively easy to use the webtruss can easily become tangled and twisted when stored but is not too much of a hassle to correct the adjustable guylines allow the rainfly to appropriately adjust when the tent is set up on nonlevel ground features there are several features that set this shelter apart from most others all guylines and sleeve openings have awesome reflective strips making this tent quick to spot even from  yards cam adjustments allow the flysheet to be easily adjusted ensuring a happy and dry camper  the inner of the flysheet has additional toggles and orings so it can be directly attached to the tent poles rather than the tent inner which greatly increases tent strength  the fly attaches directly to the tent poles with a togglering system shown separated   each end of the tent inner has two large pockets for storage and organization thanks slingfin for listening  weight merino wool sweatshirt and more are swallowed by the pocket construction  durability slingfin did not cut any corners when it comes to quality of craftsmanship they are putting into the hands of their customers  every stitch feature and clip is top of the range construction no wear has been noted during the duration of testing titanium dioxide coated fabric prolongs the lifespan of any material that is exposed to uv rays ecofriendly dac tent pegs and tent poles are used  conditions this shelter configuration has been tested on approximately four overnight trips on the appalachian trail between october and november  many thanks to the people out at slingfin for the opportunity to test this product for the trailspace gear review corps dean jankovic that blue tho  months ago your

or shelter for you consider your personal outdoor needs preferences and budget conditions first and most important in what seasons conditions and terrain will you use your tent tarp or hammock choose a shelter that can handle the conditions you expect to encounter rain snow wind heat humidity biting insects an energetic scout troop but don’t buy more tent than you truly need and don’t expect one tent to do it all capacity tents are typically classified by sleeping capacity ie oneperson twoperson etc however a tents stated sleeping capacity usually does not include much or any space for your gear and there’s no sizing standard between tent manufacturers some users size up livability will you use the tent as a basecamp or is it an emergency shelter only to determine if you and your gear will fit look at the shelter’s dimensions including floor and vestibule square areas height and headroom including at the sides plus the number and placement of doors gear lofts and pockets to assess personal livability comfort and footprint weight and packed size if you’ll be backpacking climbing cycling or otherwise carrying that shelter consider its weight packed size and your pack it needs to fit in and its spacetoweight ratio before automatically opting for the bigger tent paddlers and car campers have more room to work with but everyone should consider how the tent and its parts pack up

slingfin we make the strongest tents in the world we’re an outdoor equipment company run by industry veterans that have a passion for making only the highest quality gear based on a lifetime of design manufacturing and user experience we planted our flag at the top of the mountain mt everest to be exact and are working our way down while gaining a larger market presence in the process we are about to release our first backpack and have plans to enter the apparel and sleeping bag categories as well who are your customers we serve people that are serious about their adventures and their gear our customers know what works and what doesn’t backpackers mountaineers adventurers explorers guides and outfitters look to slingfin for gear that works when failure is not an option these people go to some of the most inhospitable places on earth use their gear all the time and know what they can trust what gives slingfin a competitive advantage our founder martin has spent over  years designing tents for the top brands in the world his design skill and passion is sewn with every stitch of every slingfin tent we’ve solved design problems have been awarded multiple utility patents and provide strength and weight savings that simply aren’t available elsewhere reviewers recognize this quality and have consistently pushed our gear to the forefront in  we were the only us company to win the prestigious gold award at the outdoor show in friedrichshafen germany europes largest outdoor gear show our technology is so good that professional guides use slingfin tents as windbreaks to keep the other tent brands from collapsing in strong winds in addition a lifetime of experimentation and design experience has resulted in slingfin having some of the best protectable intellectual property in the industry we solve design problems and offer solutions and technology that our competitors cannot for example we designed a new way of pitching tents through our invention the webtruss™ now users can pitch the tent poles by first creating a rigid structure the flysheet and tent body are added after the tent poles are locked in place by the webtruss™ which allows users to pitch their tents in high winds and severe weather with ease this is truly the next innovation in tent architecture  we’re extremely proud of this proprietary game changing step forward what makes slingfin such a trustworthy brand like we mentioned earlier we make the strongest tents in the world in our weight class  period our founder martin zemitis designed the only tent used on the summit of the worlds highest peak mount everest babu chiri sherpa spent the night at over  ft above sea level without supplemental oxygen using our gear he is the only person ever to spend a night on the summit of mount everest how are you spreading the word and marketing slingfin from the beginning we’ve let the tents speak for themselves the logo on our tents is our billboard in the mountains because people remember what stands up to the elements when a storm comes through camp ii on mount everest and our competitors’ tents collapse while ours stand people are quick to understand which brand makes gear that they can count on serious outdoors men and women come straight to us for their next tent because you can’t afford to skimp when you’re one degree away from freezing nothing advertises better quality than the difference between life and death being the last tent standing is our brand  we are the strongest tent in the mountains new customers also find us via gear reviews and wordofmouth which makes marketing costs are close to zero we received an incredible gear review for one of our tents on a very popular blog called indefinitely wild a gizmodo website and that launched our most popular tent the lite our new tent called the windsaber will also be in outside magazines “gear review” guide which has a very large audience we are waiting on additional reviews to hit media outlets in time for the  backpacking season the more people hear about and learn about our gear the larger our audience grows the addition of crowdfunding equity will only help grow our army of evangelists why did you start your own brand quality and making gear that works is all that matters to usthat’s what it’s all about at slingfinbut we didn’t have the freedom to operate this way with our previous employers we wanted to make truly great products and got sick of the race to the bottom in order to fill the price bucket targets retailers are asking for quality at so many brands has suffered after their founders retired or the company got bought out the bottom line takes over and cost cutting cannibalizes brand quality when quality suffers the people that helped build the brand move on to where their experience and skills can contribute something to the field at slingfin we make quality tools help adventurers reach their goals our users know that when you are on an  meter mountain in  mph winds you are  mm away from being outside in the storm no marketing department can help you if your tent fails a tent is your house in the mountains and that house cannot fail by running our own shop we can design and build tents as if lives depend on it  because they do what makes you so certain that slingfin will succeed our ethos experience and relationships allow us to design gear second to none we’re a design company first and not just a marketing operation we hand craft and design everything we sell our ceo sits at the sewing machine himself and creates our designs and samples second we’ve spent over  years  years collectively learning the hard lessons so we understand this space better than anyone else martin has been designing tents for top brands for  years all the while being an avid user of his own products everything we do is by deliberate design including creating our own plastic parts rather than buying them off the shelf because we have the depth of experience to know what can go wrong and what needs to be done right what some of the other companies don’t understand is that it’s often less expensive to do things right tent design is not something that is taught in schools you have to have lived it have an understanding of the tradeoffs and have insight from the right mountaineers who will tell you what the problems are third we’ve done this before we know how the game is played and we know everyone in the industry we have a great track record through helping build several other legendary brands like the north face sierra designs and mountain hardwear our advisory board is a “who’s who” of the industry we’re one degree of separation away from any resource we need in the industry where do you see yourself in the larger tent market at the moment we’re focused on extending our lead in the specialty tent market—which sells m  m annually— to prove our technology and capture the customers that set trends when they see our gear work in the most extreme conditions people will know it will work anywhere once we’ve won this market we can apply our expeditionproven technology to a larger market segment of backpacks and adventurers how do you view the competition many of the major brands have hollowed out their design capacity in search of lower costs the outdoor industry as a whole is plagued by this disease a regression from innovative design in pursuit of wider margins but increasing marketing budget is no substitute for innovation because the majority of our competitors aren’t doing a lot of new and exciting things they’ve had a hard time retaining their creative staff this means that there aren’t a lot of people left in the industry who know how to bring something really innovative to market which has created an opening for us our competitors have deeper pockets and can offer more favorable terms to dealers but we still find an overwhelming number of dealers coming to us because they want our unique product we’re focused on offering designs and solutions our customers want and our competitors cannot offer what are your expansion plans after five years of research  development and proving market fit now is the time to accelerate our growth we will use this investment to boost our factory order sizes allowing us to take advantage of volume pricing and instantaneously increase our margin from  to nearly  this inventory increase will also allow us to expand our dealer network and solve the repeated challenge we’ve faced in running out of inventory which has put us in the unwelcome position of being unable to fill orders for  tents we’re also looking to grow our marketing beyond the wordofmouth that has propelled us to this point by expanding our online social media grassroots and trade show presence finally we’re excited about the opportunity to apply our highend technology to products that more and more people can use such as expanding our ultralight tents and hardshell backpack the “honey badger” pack and pannier once the honey badger pack and pannier comes online we will expand distribution greatly which means more reps more stores and more online representation entering the backpack category presents a lower entry price and a much larger audience we will still focus on specialty distribution that understands how to represent a quality brand properly once we open our target specialty shops in the us then we will look to larger specialty outlets why create a hard shell backpack the honey badger backpack is a patented design unlike anything else in the market due to its versatility and efficiency it was inspired by our experience in getting tents up to everest base camp where we discovered that after the tents were set up there were a lot of duffel bags wooden crates and hard containers leftover from carrying the tents the waste left at basecamp was overwhelming we wanted to make an adaptable product that would let you carry gear up to basecamp then reconfigure the bag and use it for another task we ended up with a semirigid exoskeleton with attachment points everywhere on the pack that allows you to carry nearly twice as much weight and volume as similarly sized packs it also includes a separate waterproof inner bag that will protect your sensitive gear from getting wet it’s easy to carry easy to pack and extremely durable  as proven by our development tests involving dragging it behind a truck and dropping it from an airplanewe just sent our initial batch of packs to testers and product reviewers and are looking forward to rolling out sales later this year through our existing distribution network who does your manufacturing we have a  yearold relationship with a taiwanese manufacturing partner who has been producing tents since the s they’re the best in the business we use their factory in vietnam because it has the most experienced sewing staff anywhere they take great pride in their craftsmanship and have been a true partner in finding innovative ways to make our vision a reality what are your unit economics our margin is currently  when selling to retailers  appreciably ahead of the industry average of  for hardgoods our margins triple when we sell directtoconsumer through our website because we can capture the full msrp currently we sell half direct and half through the other channels by carefully managing our skus and growth we’ve been able to sustain these margins with this funding we’ll be able to take advantage of  minimum order quantity discounts which will expand margins further to  given the quality of our gear and the difference it can make between life and death it’s unlikely we’ll ever have to cheapen our brand with discounts we are setting the standard which allows us to charge accordingly what is your distribution model we sell through specialty retailers all over the country and from our own website we leverage our longrunning industry relationships to connect with the specialty retailers at regional and national trade shows specialty shop owners get it because they see what we’ve delivered in the past at previous brands understand the products that we’re building now and see our future vision dealers especially appreciate that we are not over distributed and the “street” price on our products is our msrp we are vigilant with our map policy which further strengthens our relationship with our specialty dealers what about international distribution internationally we have a thriving business in south korea our current plan is to expand to other countries via a licensee model this business model is advantageous since the funds are bottom line dollars  of cost without risk to slingfin another advantage is that larger orders help with economies of scale and pricing do you have plans to partner with larger distributors to sell your consumer grade tents our focus is to partner with the right dealers that understand the slingfin brand and our products  whether it be brick and mortar stores or online we will remain true to the brand and our mission and not bend over for the big guys and their price bucket strategies rushing to get into big chains like rei sounds good to the general public but in reality that’s a shortcut to bankruptcy what challenges are you facing right now we need working capital to help support our growth in some cases we’re unable to fill orders because we don’t have products in stock we’re also missing out on volume discounts because we don’t have enough capital to increase our minimum order size we’re excited to move past the fundraising process and return full focus to our products finding capital that has the same vision as we do is a total time sink we see crowdfunding for equity as a tremendous opportunity by matching the investors’ vision with the companys vision what keeps you up at night i sleep like a baby because i live my life by doing right by people and the environment however there are those nights when the realities of meeting payroll and growing a business interfere with my rem time we have the margin design ip manufacturing and distribution challenges handled but matching cash flow to growth is the real challenge our goal is to become financially sustainable so we can grow organically and finance orders on time while maintaining control of the company we also need to continually find ways to communicate our superior design and value to consumers we are driven to be the best and that is a  hoursaday job what we are working on now will be seen   or perhaps  years down the road and getting it right requires constant work we have technology that will define the next generation of tents but there are just not enough hours in the day to make it happen especially as the little guy we have to work that much harder to break our way into the marketplace dominated by the big conglomerates but that’s also what drives us so i see many sleepless nights going forward  not because of unrest but because i’m eager to make a difference why have you given your customers the chance to invest in slingfin to date our investors have been family friends mountaineers and guides that share our vision unfortunately there were also a lot of the above who do not qualify as an accredited investor so they were not able to purchase shares but have been supporting in other ways we’re excited about the opportunity to broaden that pool and share our success with the users who are excited about what we’re doing “democratizing investing” is a brilliant idea and will increase collective social good by supporting projects that people believe in we love the idea of being able to invest in small companies that have double and triplebottom lines that we believe in crowdfunding for equity will change the way the most innovative and creative ideas will come to light the solutions to the worlds problems will come from the small innovators with great ideas and solutions and not from the boardrooms of transnational corporations that find change too costly or inconvenient to their long term plans if you share our vision then join us for a great ride although we’re taking the road less explored we
