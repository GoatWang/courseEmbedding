does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected

major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers by acquiring the eseries product family originally known as erx through the purchase of unisphere in  by  both

in yellow backdoor admin password hidden in the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt traffic software defined networkingedit according to a  swot analysis by marketline in recent history juniper has been focusing on softwaredefined networking

software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected to erode junipers growing share of the market but other

inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt

does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected

major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers by acquiring the eseries product family originally known as erx through the purchase of unisphere in  by  both cisco and juniper had increased their focus on edge routers because many isps had built up abundant bandwidth at the core several improvements to junipers software and its broadband aggregation

in yellow backdoor admin password hidden in the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt traffic software defined networkingedit according to a  swot analysis by marketline in recent history juniper has been focusing on softwaredefined networking

inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt

position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected

major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers by acquiring the eseries product family originally known as erx through the purchase of unisphere in  by  both

in yellow backdoor admin password hidden in the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt traffic software defined networkingedit according to a  swot analysis by marketline in recent history juniper has been focusing on softwaredefined networking
