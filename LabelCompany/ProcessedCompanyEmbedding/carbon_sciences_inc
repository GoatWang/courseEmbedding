carbon sciences  information technology solutions technology after successfully exploring methods to produce low cost graphene � the new miracle material � carbon sciences is now focused on the research and development of graphenebased devices to enable ultrafast fiber optics communication in cloud computing infrastructure by applying the high speed optical and electrical properties of graphene we believe graphenebased fiber optic components such as optical modulators and photodetectors can help unclog the speed bottlenecks in the cloud thereby enabling a global era of high resolution video on demand high fidelity music streaming high volume ecommerce and many more cloudbased services services after a substantial period of research carbon sciences has narrowed its acquisition search focus to cloudbased data collection and analytics services with cloud computing infrastructure becoming more costeffective and available this segment of the information technology business has become an attractive growth industry we believe we can apply cloud big data and mobile paradigms to create value in existing industries such as retail entertainment and commerce by connecting people with places we intend to acquire companies with specific applications and services that help us achieve this goal latest news july   carbon sciences names new ceojuly  carbon

that is only one atom thick is flexible transparent impermeable to moisture stronger than diamonds and more conductive than gold experts believe graphene to be the miracle material that will enable revolutionary applications such as bendable touch screen displays rapid charge batteries supercapacitors low cost solar cells extreme highspeed semiconductors biosensors as well as water purification while the incredible properties of graphene make it worthy of its miracle material label the quest to actually produce and use graphene in commercial applications is full of challenges using simple adhesive tape to lift flakes of graphene from graphite university of manchester researchers geim and novoselov were awarded the  nobel prize in physics for their pioneering isolation and characterization of graphene however to unleash its full potential for commercial applications a more highly controlled and efficient way to produce high quality graphene is needed many laboratories around the world have produced graphene sheets in very small sizes such as centimeter squares while there are advancements in creating large sheets they are not yet at commercial scale a flexible cvd graphene process carbon sciences is developing an innovative flexible chemical vapor deposition cvd process that will rapidly produce commercial size sheets of graphene with the ability for insitu finetuning of applicationspecific electrical and materials properties unlike the lifting of naturally occurring graphene sheets from graphite a cvd process can chemically synthesize graphene sheets using raw materials such as methane ch the primary component of readily available and abundant natural gas in a cvd process carbon atoms are broken off of methane molecules and then reassembled into a pristine sheet of honeycomb graphene lattice cvd machines are commercially available and are proven platforms for the highspeed production of materials for the electronics industry a graphene specific cvd process would have process and catalyst innovations specifically designed for graphene some of the key features under development and benefits features benefits multilayer growth a sheet of graphene is one atom thick therefore it cannot be simply picked off the shelf and used at an industrial scale our cvd process will produce multiple layers of graphene along with layers of other materials to form a monolithic composite which could be used for applications such as touch screen displays insitu doping as an integrated graphene fabrication process we can dope the graphene with intentional impurities to modulate its electrical and materials properties for example studies have shown that nitrogendoped graphene exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and is ideally suited for applications such as fuel cells metalair batteries and biosensors tunable sheet resistance different applications have different sheet resistance requirements for example touch screens smart windows and flexible lcds need a sheet resistance of approximately  ohmssq while oled displays and solar cells require less than  ohmssq our process will produce graphene with tunable sheet resistance using novel doping techniques and controlled multilayer graphene growth tunable bandgap semiconductors are the foundation of all digital electronics one of the key requirements of a semiconductor is the ability to turn on and off its electron flow through the modulation of its bandgap unfortunately single sheet graphene has no bandgap and electrons flow through it at light speed however it is known that bilayer graphene  layers exhibits bandgap under very specific bernal or ab stacking order through the precise and controlled features of our cvd process we expect to achieve precise and specific stacking order of graphene sheets to produce tunable bandgaps for various semiconductor applications such as highspeed graphene transistors and circuits research and development

naveed aslamcto number of employees  website carbonsciencescom carbon sciences is a public corporation based in santa barbara the company was founded in  and incorporated as zingerang inc originally the company was involved in mobile communication but has since switched to developing co to fuel technology calcium carbonate caco was briefly looked at as another end product of co recycling on april   the name was changed to carbon sciences inc their process differs from other projects in that it does not utilize high pressure or high temperature this would be a significant advantage when trying to scale the technology up to commercial production contents  technology  see also  references  external links technologyedit byron elton the ceo and president of carbon sciences explained in a report with newsweek that they are in the developmental stages of a carbon recycling technology that involves capturing the greenhouse gas co and transforming it into gasoline jet fuel diesel fuel methanol propane and butane the main process involves taking the oxygen molecules out of water and carbon dioxide in a biocatalytic process the remaining carbon monoxide and hydrogen are then combined to make basic hydrocarbons using the fischer–tropsch process these hydrocarbons are then transformed into a variety of fuels in the early stages of the technology the process required pure carbon dioxide and pure water however updates to the technology will allow it to be placed at the output of a large emitter such as a power plant where many other elements and compounds are present their catalyst was developed in partnership with the university of saskatchewan if the methane is obtained from a landfill the process would completely utilize recycled compounds the end product would be much cleaner than natural fuels because it would not contain smogcausing air pollutants an application has been sent in for funding from the department of energy under the category innovative concepts for beneficial uses of co and a patent application has been submitted to the united states patent and trademark office similar technology is also being developed at the sandia national laboratories and at a joint venture between uop llc and the university of southern california robert boyce an editor for the new york times challenged the wisdom of carbon capture asserting that is an energyintensive process and unlike natural gas carbon dioxide is a worthless waste product elton responded with a letter that was published in both the print and online versions of the newspaper in the letter he states the problem with ccs is not the cc carbon capture but the s storage ccr on the other hand carbon capture and recycling is a terrific bet on carbon he also added our cobased technology is a radical departure from conventional gtl processes we anticipate we will significantly reduce capital costs and be co negative two major current challenges after carbon sciences announced successful testing of their catalyst ariel schwartz pointed out that until the project can be tested outside of a lab setting it is still a big if see alsoedit carbon capture and storage carbon sequestration
