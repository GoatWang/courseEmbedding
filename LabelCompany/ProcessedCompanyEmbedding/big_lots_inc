have your product placed in big lots  start with the right questions before you try distributing your product to big lots you need to ask yourself a few basic questions do you need to build demand for your product or is there already a demand for it do you know that big lots would be interested in selling your product if you can strike a deal with big lots can you handle the production volume do you want to sell directly to big lots or do you want to license your product to a manufacturer that will handle distribution  be prepared to profit does your product offer enough of a profit margin for big lots can you sell your product at a reasonable enough profit to cover the packaging shipping commissions marketing and wholesale distribution check big lots’s guidelines for other fees that you will have to build into the cost of your product in order for you to be able to turn enough of a profit to make the effort worth your while if you work with a discount retailer they will try to strip your profits down to zero in order to keep their prices as low as possible the typical breakdown of margins are if a products costs  to produce that product will retail for  that product that retails for  will wholesale for  to distributors and stores that purchase direct big box retailers like big lots may offer to pay  to the manufacturer if the product costs  to produce that is the typical profit margin  determine if big lots is the right store for your product the relationship between you and big lots starts with you browsing their store for competing products if big lots already has a similar product it is going to be very difficult to get your product picked up spend some time at your local big lots to see what kind of products they are selling speak to the manager and see if he thinks your product will sell well in their store picture in which zone your product would best fit on the shelf and keep in mind that the most precious asset that these big box stores value are their shelf space keep this information in mind when you are preparing your presentation to big lots if your company is minority or women owned check big lots’s website and see if they offer specific opportunities for those designations  pitch your product to big lots decide whether it will be you or a representative to present your product to big lots your presentation depends heavily on your strengths as a businessperson as they will most likely ask financial questions and logistics questions it’s common for companies to hire a broker to pitch their product to big lots as it will be more likely that your product will make it to the next stage if the individual pitching your product has industry knowledge or a personal relationship with big lots the percentage of commission verses however generally a broker will take around  to represent your product to big lots we at mr checkout have experience dealing with brokers and know that there are several retail brokers that have poor business practices that can potentially damage your brand if you are seeking a legitimate big lots broker please give us a call for a recommendation it could save you a huge headache and a lot of money  complete the required big lots paperwork often big lots will have you go through an application process however before submitting the paperwork required by big lots you should contact a buyer at big lots and let them know your intentions having a contact inside of the company will potentially move your application more smoothly through the process  anticipate the need for increased volume having big lots agree to stock your product will most likely mean a significant increase in volume you should be prepared to ramp up your production and informing your manufacturer of this opportunity having production logistics and distribution to sync is not only difficult it requires a significant amount of time invested in customer relations also big lots may have stipulations in the contract that may penalize you for delays in shipping and production have an attorney explain all contracts to you if you don’t understand the terms if you’re looking to distribute your product to big lots be
