statements certain statements below about anticipated results and our products and markets are forwardlooking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k use of constant currency revenue from our international operations has historically represented more than half of our total revenue as a result our revenue results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example if the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons we believe the presentation of revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis enhances the understanding of our revenue results and evaluation of our performance in comparison to prior periods the constant currency information presented is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap overview we are a global software company that simplifies the development deployment and management of business applications on premise or in the cloud on any platform or device to any data source with enhanced performance minimal it complexity and low total cost of ownership our comprehensive portfolio of products provides leading solutions for rapid application development broad data integration and efficient data analysis our solutions are used across a variety of industries at the beginning of fiscal year  we acquired telerik ad a leading provider of application development tools telerik enables its  million strong developer community to create compelling user experiences across cloud web mobile and desktop applications through this acquisition we provide comprehensive cloud and onpremise platform offerings that enable developers to rapidly create applications driven by data for any web desktop or mobile platform the revenue of telerik is being recognized ratably over the maintenance period which is generally one year as vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe of fair value cannot be established for such maintenance as a result of acquisition accounting the acquired deferred revenue balance was significantly reduced to reflect its fair value as of the acquisition date however we are still incurring the associated costs to fulfill the acquired deferred revenue which are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as a result our expenses as a percentage of total revenue are higher than we expect they will be in future periods once this acquired deferred revenue balance is recognized effective september   we began operating as three distinct segments in fiscal year  we repurchased and retired  million shares for  million under our fiscal year  share repurchase authorization leaving  million remaining under the authorization in september  our board of directors authorized a new  million share repurchase program which increased the total authorization to  million the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors and the board of directors may choose to suspend expand or discontinue the repurchase program at any time we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations which are primarily conducted in foreign currencies as a result changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar have significantly impacted our results of operations and may impact our future results of operations beginning in the fourth quarter of  the value of the us dollar strengthened in comparison to certain foreign currencies including in europe brazil and australia and continued to strengthen during the first half of  since approximately  of our revenue is denominated in foreign currency our revenue results have been negatively impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and other strategic transactions designed to expand our business andor add complementary products and technologies to our existing product sets as a result our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements through at least the next twelve months results of
