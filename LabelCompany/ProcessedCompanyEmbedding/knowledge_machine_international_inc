disagreements between us and any of the former directors   business overview   as noted above in connection with the closing of the share exchange with everystory we terminated our prior business and intend to focus on implementing and developing the business of everystory as our primary business and operations   organization and structure   by way of background everystory inc a delaware corporation “ everystory ” or the “ company ” or “we” “our” or “us” was founded on september   from inception until everystory formally launched operations in september  everystory was a development stage company   overview – the platform   everystory began as a new digital image storysharing platform the “ platform ” that allows users to collaboratively create preserve and share personal stories in one place accessible via mobile devices on both ios and android systems including mobile phones and tablets as well as desktops everystory lets users store audio and image files to a private secure cloudbased system with the option of sharing photos and stories with other everystory individual users and groups each user selects the members of hisher group thereby creating private secure micro social networks   everystory is also actively exploring applications of its technology within the digital healthcare markets as discussed in more detail below   david keene is the chief technical officer and founder of everystory in his words “i created everystory after being diagnosed with colon cancer and realizing my son might never remember my voice or hear my stories i am passionate about providing people with an innovative way to preserve and share memories forever in the most interactive way possible” mr keene was successfully treated in  and is now healthy and cancerfree              through the everystory platform users can import photos from a computer or mobile device photo album or scan physical photos directly into the app using a device camera everystory integrates a social network component by having activityview functionality and by encouraging users to tag photos with people locations subjects or dates everystory allows multiple users to record audio messages of any length on the same photos in a shared album or within a group to create an interactive photoalbum users can tap a tagged person’s name to hear the story that is connected to a specific photo or album   key components of everystory include   cloudbased data storage photos and audio stories are sent to the cloud immediately after being uploaded to the everystory platform thus both the photo stories and audio stories while immediately accessible to users are also safely stored on the cloud indefinitely   audio recording users are able to record audio narrative and stories ranging from minutes to hours to accompany the photos naturally and organically – as if the stories were being told to a gathering of family or friends with whom the photos were being shared multiple users can record over one photo or a series of photos to tell the stories exactly as they as they happened and exactly how the user wants them to be heard   photo importing the everystory platform allows users to import photos directly from a computer an ios photo album or an android photo album in addition actual physical photographs can be scanned directly into the application using a device camera   playback capabilities everystory app users can listen to stories from the beginning the middle or work backwards from the end everystory’s proprietary playback technology allows users to enjoy photos and the stories that accompany them in virtually any way that they desire   collaborative sharing the everystory app allows users to create groups large or small family or friends or both to enhance the users’ memories and experiences through contributed photos and stories in a private secure sharing environment   designed for mobile because the everystory app was designed for mobile platforms it enables users to record and store life’s memorable moments as they happen and wherever the user is the everystory app is available on ios and android   application of the platform – digital therapeutics and reminiscence therapy   digital therapeutics   everystory’s technology platform streamlines the creation of personalized digital stories and our management is focused on the goal of becoming the first clinicallyproven digital therapeutic technology targeting patients with alzheimers disease and dementia everystory already has received a us patent issued in  that broadly covers the use of everystory’s technology in senior living facilities everystory is in the final stages of preparation to run a clinical trial with the university of california at san diego “ ucsd ” showing that everystory is an effective anxiety reduction and quality of life therapy for those with alzheimer’s disease or dementia “ adod ”   in connection with this application of the platform everystory is focusing on the developing fields of reminiscence therapy and digital therapeutics   reminiscence therapy rt    reminiscence therapy involves either discussing or reviewing recognizable memories from the past and helps both calm and ground dementia patients when suffering from heightened anxiety   reminiscence therapy rt involves the discussion of past activities events and experiences with another person or group of people usually with the aid of tangible prompts such as photographs household and other familiar items from the past music and archive sound recordings reminiscence therapy groups may involve group meetings in which participants are encouraged to talk about past events at least once a week rt may also involve individual sessions in which the person is guided chronologically through life experiences encouraged to evaluate them and may produce a life story book family caregivers are increasingly involved in reminiscence therapy reminiscence therapy is one of the most popular psychosocial interventions in dementia care and is highly rated by staff and participants there is evidence to suggest that rt is also effective in improving mood in older people without dementia its effects on mood cognition and wellbeing in dementia are less well understood               everystory believes that one highly effective way to deliver rt to patients is through photos that bring back memories and include voices that are familiar to them  rt is a highly effective therapy for alzheimer’s and dementia patients however because it is very labor intensive it is hard to scale to a large number of patients   digital therapeutics   the term “digital therapeutics” refers to using a digital system to treat a medical condition much as one might use a drug a human counselor or surgery digital therapeutics are used both standalone and in combination with conventional therapies    the goal of digital therapeutics is to mirror an effective treatment already in use but use technology to scale it to a large patien t population  a prime example of a successful digital therapeutic company is omadahealth which is targeting diabetes by having people participate in a digital guided program that can delay the onset of early stage diabetes   scale of the markets us    the  population in the us is expected to grow faster than any other age group—from  million in  to  million by   alzheimers and other dementias adod o for  total payments for health care longterm care and hospice are estimated to be  billion  senior living and long term care o the national investment center for the seniors housing  care industry “ nic ” estimates expenditures for “longterm care services” between  and  billion   annual costs of senior living care us   costs required for the care adod patients are as much five times average  per year vs someone of the same age without dementia  per year   click to enlarge                click to enlarge   business model   prior to the closing of the acquisition transaction with kmi everystory had been in negotiations with the university of california at san diego “ ucsd ” to conduct a clinical trial t o determine whether everystory and its reminscence therapy and digital therapeutics technology and implementation techniques are an effective in reducing anxiety and as part of quality of life improvement therapy for those with alzheimer’s disease or dementia “ adod ”   assuming that the results of the clinical trial match the anecdotal evidence that everystory has observed and experienced once th e clinical trial has been completed and the data published everystory intends to offer the digital therapeutics technology directly to the families of adod patients as a clinical supported therapy additionally everystory intends to partner directly with senior living management firms and to offer a revenue sharing arrangement for the patients and families of the senior living firms that chooses to implement the therapy for their loved ones   in both the directtopatient and the senior livingmanagement models management anticipates that the product which will include a digital tablet in the patient’s room will cost approximately  per month or  per year per patient   additionally everystory intends to find a partner in china to help make introductions to the senior livingtype markets and other implementation techniques   intellectual property   as noted above everystory has acquired an issued patent from seniors in touch patent number us  b the “ es patent ” on its technology the title of the es patent is “everystory senior living patent” and is summarized as follows “ a system and method is disclosed whereby a patient at a senior care facility can send and receive messages via the internet tools are provided to manage the patients the patients relative contact mail and photo collection relatives can be designated to suggest changes to the contacts and edit the contents of the patients contacts files the messages may be audio video or text and the user friendly system helps the patients navigate through the process notification is provided so that the relatives and patients know when a message had been received further notification is provided if a prolonged period lapses after receipt of a message to a patient and the message has not been read ” the es patent was filed on february   and the publication date was may     in addition everystory has filed additional patents    everystory server platform a restful cloud based api for storing and organizing audio text and video

provisional application no             filing date    may                operations   substantially all of everystory’s communications network and the computer hardware used to operate our websites are colocated in a thirdparty facility in addition we use a combination of thirdparty internetbased or cloud computing services and offsite backup services in connection with our business operations and our disaster recovery systems we have designed our websites to be highly available secure and costeffective using a variety of proprietary software thirdparty services and freely available and commercially supported tools we can scale to accommodate increasing numbers of registered users by adding relatively inexpensive industrystandard software we use encryption technologies and certificates for secure transmission of personal information between users and our websites   competition   everystory’s prior operations relating principally to socialmediatype applications of the platform faced indirect competition from companies in the photo archiving photoaudio interconnectivity social networking and cloud storage sectors many of these companies are considerably larger have greater resources and a longer operating history than does everystory management believes however that this is indirect competition because to the best of management’s knowledge there is not a competitor product that has the storytelling capability of the everystory platform management expects that competition in the sector will grow and become more intense through industry consolidation as well as the emergence of new participants in everystory’s market everystory intends to compete on the basis of ease of use technology brand recognition quality of products and service and support our competitive strategy may be significantly affected in the future by many external factors among them are marketing costs technology and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies   as we build and develop the digital therapeutics applications of the platform we will continue to review and disclose information relating to competition in the digital therapeutic markets   nearterm changes anticipated – reverse stock split name change   as noted in a current report filed on october   prior to the closing of the everystory transaction we sought and obtained shareholder approval to amend the company’s articles of incorporation as amended to date to effectuate a reverse stock split of our common stock the “ reverse split ” the company’s new management team has taken steps to effectuate the reverse stock split including filing a certificate of amendment to our articles with the nevada secretary of state’s office and filing an issuer company related action notification with finra to effectuate the reverse split   the certificate of amendment also changes the company’s name from knowledge machine international inc to dthera sciences management believes that the new name will better reflect the focus of the company on the digital therapeutic and reminiscence therapy markets which will be the company’s new primary focus   assuming that we can complete all regulatory filings and provide the required information the reverse split and the name change should take effect on october   we will provide additional information relating to the effectiveness of these transactions in our public filings   employees   as of the date of the report the company had one fulltime employee our chief executive officer and no parttime employees other than the ceo all others working with the company are consultants working with the company under consulting agreements management believes that our relationship with these consultants is good   item a risk factors   an investment in our company involves significant risks including the risks described below you should consult with your own financial and legal advisors and carefully consider the material risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline   risks related to our company and its business   we have a limited operating history and limited historical financial information upon which you may evaluate our performance   you should consider among other factors our prospects for success in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies that like us are in their early stages of development we may not successfully address the usual and ordinary risks and uncertainties associated with being an early stage company or successfully implement our existing and new products and services if we fail to do so it could materially harm our business even if we accomplish these objectives we may not generate the positive cash flows or profits we anticipate in the future unanticipated problems expenses and delays are frequently encountered in establishing a new business and developing new products and services these include but are not limited to inadequate funding lack of consumer acceptance competition product development and inadequate sales and marketing our failure to meet any of these conditions would have a material adverse effect upon us and may force us to reduce or curtail our operations no assurance can be given that we will operate profitably even though we are being managed by individuals with significant industry experience our limited operating history makes it difficult to predict the longterm success of our business model              we depend on key personnel   for the foreseeable future our success will depend largely on management’s industry knowledge marketing skills and relationships with key investors customer bases and industry leaders we have one fulltime employee our chief executive officer all others working with the company are outside consultants providing services to the company in their areas of expertise should any of these individuals leave everystory or cease to provide consulting services such departures may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations   we will indemnify management and the members of the board of directors   these key decisionmakers will be entitled to indemnification from everystory except in certain circumstances as more fully set forth in our articles of incorporation and bylaws each as amended or amended and restated   if we fail to effectively manage growth our business brand and reputation results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected   we may experience a rapid growth in operations which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure as we continue to grow we must effectively identify integrate develop and motivate new employees and maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture to attract top talent we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages the risks of overhiring or overcompensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability additionally if we do not effectively manage our growth the quality of our services could suffer which could adversely affect our business brand and reputation results of operations and financial condition if operational technology and infrastructure improvements are not implemented successfully our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues to effectively manage our growth we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures this will require that we refine our information technology systems to maintain effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure that our employees effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of customers these system enhancements and improvements will require significant incremental and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources if we fail to implement these improvements and maintenance programs effectively our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional expenses   if our efforts to retain and attract subscribers are not successful our revenues may be materially affected   we intend to generate substantially all of our revenues from subscriptions to our services we must continue to retain existing and attract new subscribers which we seek to do in part by investing in our product platform and new services and technologies if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to retain them and as a result our revenues would be adversely affected for example if consumers do not perceive our services to be reliable valuable and of high quality if we fail to regularly introduce new and improved services and more content or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by the market we may not be able to retain existing or attract new subscribers we rely on our marketing and advertising efforts to attract new subscribers if we are unable to effectively retain existing subscribers and attract new subscribers our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected   if we experience excessive rates of subscriber cancellation our revenues and business may be harmed   we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who choose to cancel their subscriptions and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base subscribers may choose to cancel their subscriptions for many reasons including a desire to reduce discretionary spending a perception that they do not have sufficient time to use the service or otherwise do not use the service sufficiently the service is a poor value competitive services provide a better value or experience or subscriber service issues are not satisfactorily resolved subscribers may choose to cancel their subscriptions at any time prior to the renewal date we may also experience fluctuations in cancellations as we pursue new subscribers through new marketing channels or if we have a large number of subscriptions come up for renewal in the same period              if our subscriber cancellations increase we would be required to increase the rate at which we add new subscribers in order to maintain and grow our revenues if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing and advertising expenses than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers greater than the impact of our cancellations our subscriber base will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected   our business depends substantially on customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their use of our services any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of our services would harm our future operating results   in order for us to maintain or improve our operating results it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions with us when the existing subscription term expires our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions upon expiration and we cannot assure you that customers will renew subscriptions at the same or higher level of service if at all   our retention rate may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including our customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services the effectiveness of our customer support services our pricing the prices of competing products or services the effects of global economic conditions or reductions in our customers’ spending levels if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or renew on less favorable terms our revenue may decline and we may not realize improved operating results from our customer base   a change in our mix of subscription durations could have a significant impact on our revenues net subscribers and revenue visibility   we intend periodically to evaluate and test the types of subscriptions that we offer based on the results of any product or price testing conducted we may change the types of subscriptions we offer or we may price and market different types of subscriptions if a higher percentage of our subscribers choose a shorter subscription duration we would likely experience higher cancellation volumes which may result in decreased immediate and longterm revenues in the future we may continue to perform product and price tests involving our prospective users the results of which could affect our number or mix of subscribers and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and key operating metrics   we cannot accurately predict new subscription rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results   in order for us to improve our operating results and continue to grow our business it is important that we continue to attract new customers to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base we could incur increased losses because costs associated with new customers are generally incurred up front while revenue is recognized ratably over the term of our subscription services alternatively to the extent we are unsuccessful in increasing our customer base we could also incur increased losses as costs associated with marketing programs and new products intended to attract new customers would not be offset by incremental revenue and cash flow all of these factors can negatively impact our future revenue and operating results   if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to generate additional revenues on a costeffective basis or if we are unable to manage our marketing and advertising expenses it could materially harm our results of operations and growth   our future growth and profitability as well as the maintenance and enhancement of our brands will depend in large part on the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures we intend to use a diverse mix of marketing and advertising programs to promote our products and services and we plan periodically to adjust our mix of these programs significant increases in the pricing of one or more of our marketing and advertising channels could increase our marketing and advertising expense or cause us to choose less effective marketing and advertising channels further we may over time become disproportionately reliant on one channel or partner which could increase our operating expenses because we recognize revenues ratably over the subscription period we have incurred and may in the future incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we anticipate recognizing revenues associated with such expenses and our marketing and advertising expenditures may not continue to result in increased revenues or generate sufficient levels of brand awareness if we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on costeffective terms or replace existing marketing and advertising channels with similarly effective channels our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially our subscriber levels could be affected adversely and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer in addition our expanded marketing efforts may increase our subscriber acquisition cost as additional expenses may not result in sufficient customer growth to offset cost which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations              any significant disruption in service on our web site or in our computer systems which are currently hosted primarily by a single thirdparty could damage our reputation and result in a loss of subscribers which would harm our business and operating results   subscribers access our service through our web site and through mobile device apps our brand reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers depend upon the reliable performance of our web site network infrastructure content delivery processes and payment systems interruptions in these systems whether due to system failures computer viruses or physical or electronic breakins could affect the security or availability of our web site and prevent our subscribers from accessing our data and using our products and services problems with the reliability or security of our systems may harm our reputation and require disclosure to our lenders and the cost of remedying these problems could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations   substantially all of our communications network and computer hardware used to operate our web site are located in facilities owned and operated by a third party we do not own or control the operation of these facilities our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war electronic and physical breakins computer viruses earthquakes and similar events the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur our systems are not completely redundant so a failure of our system at our primary site could result in reduced functionality for our customers and a total failure of our systems at both sites could cause our web site to be inaccessible by our customers problems faced by our thirdparty web hosting provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its customers including us could adversely affect the experience of our subscribers our thirdparty web hosting provider could decide to close its facilities without adequate notice in addition any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy reorganization faced by our thirdparty web hosting provider or any of the service providers with whom it contracts may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict additionally if our thirdparty web hosting provider is unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity this could have a material adverse effect on our business any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   our possession and use of personal information present risks and expenses that could harm our business unauthorized disclosure or use of such data whether through breach of our network security or otherwise could expose us to significant liability and damage our reputation   maintaining the security of our information technology and network systems infrastructure is of critical importance because we handle confidential subscriber registered user employee and other sensitive data such as names addresses credit card numbers and other personal information in addition our online systems include the content that our registered users upload onto our web sites such as family records and photos this content is often personally meaningful and our registered users may rely on our online system to store digital copies of such content if we were to lose such content if our users’ private content were to become publicly available or if third parties were able to gain unauthorized access to such content we may face liability and harm to our brand and reputation   we anticipate that most of our subscribers will use credit and debit cards to purchase our products and services if we or our processing vendors were to have problems with our billing software it could have an adverse effect on our subscriber satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment services in addition if our billing software fails to work properly and as a result we do not charge our subscribers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at all our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected   we and our vendors use commercially available encryption technology to transmit personal information when taking orders we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information including registered users’ uploaded content however third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures including by developing and deploying viruses worms and other malicious software programs that are designed to attack or attempt to infiltrate our systems and networks in addition employee error malfeasance or other errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of registered user or employee privacy   additionally we may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data if we experience a security breach or other lapse in the handling of confidential information of this kind the incident could give rise to risks including data loss litigation and liability and could harm our reputation or disrupt our operations any of which could materially adversely affect our business in addition various states and countries have differing laws regarding protection of customer privacy and confidential information including notification requirements in the event of certain breaches or losses of information efforts to comply with these laws and regulations increase our costs of doing business and failure to achieve compliance could result in substantial liability to our business and harm our reputation in the event of a security breach or loss of confidential information we could be subject to fines penalties damages and other remedies under applicable laws any of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business operating results and financial condition              if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our registered users or employees we may be required to expend significant resources in efforts to address these problems a major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced demand for our products and services an unwillingness of subscribers to provide us with their credit card or payment information an unwillingness of registered users to upload family records or photos onto our web sites harm to our reputation and brand and loss of our ability to accept and process subscriber credit card orders similarly if a wellpublicized breach of data security at any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commercial transactions any of these events could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses   we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future   we will have losses and accumulated deficit as a result of the substantial investments we will make to acquire new customers and develop our services we intend to continue scaling our business to increase our number of users and to meet the increasingly complex needs of our customers we expect to invest and to continue to invest in our sales and marketing organizations to sell our services around the world and in our development organization to deliver additional features and capabilities of our cloud services to address our customers’ evolving needs we also expect to continue to make significant investments in our datacenter infrastructure and in our professional service organization as we focus on customer success as a result of our continuing investments to scale our business in each of these areas we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future furthermore to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base we will also incur increased losses due to upfront costs associated with acquiring new customers particularly as a result of the limited free trial version of our service and the nature of subscription revenue which is generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that if we do become profitable we will sustain profitability   the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed   the market for our cloudbased interactive photo and audio storytelling platform services is fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry for certain applications and services many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition much longer operating histories larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do our competitors include but are not limited to large social media companies with a focus on family history cloud storage companies that enable users to store photos videos and photos that record sound to cloudbased private accounts individualized media platforms that allow users to post compilations of images and videos and file hosting services that offer users cloudbased file storage that can be accessed by any of the user’s computers or devices with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future if we fail to compete effectively our business will be harmed some of our principal competitors may offer their products or services at a lower price which will result in pricing pressures on our business if we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales lower margins losses or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance any of which could harm our business   many of our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or services as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors   if the cloudbased collaborationready interactive microsocial network market develops more slowly than we expect or if it declines our business could be materially adversely affected if the everystory legacy program is not successful or develops more slowly than we expect our business could be materially adversely affected   the cloudbased collaborationready interactive microsocial network “ crimsn ” market for which everystory’s software platform was designed is a relatively new market and not firmly established accordingly it is uncertain whether a cloudbased service like everystory’s will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance because we derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenue and cash flows from sales of our cloudbased crimsn solution our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud computing in general and of cloudbased content collaboration services in particular it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our services the future growth rate and size of the cloud computing market or the entry of competitive services the expansion of a cloudbased crimsn market depends on a number of factors including the cost performance and perceived value associated with cloud computing as well as the ability of companies that provide cloudbased services to address security and privacy concerns if we or other providers of cloudbased services experience security incidents loss of customer data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for cloudbased services as a whole including our services may be negatively affected if cloudbased services do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for cloudbased services caused by a lack of customer acceptance technological challenges weakening economic conditions security or privacy concerns competing technologies and products decreases in corporate spending or otherwise it could result in decreased revenue harm our growth rates and adversely affect our business and operating results everystory is currently making arrangements to conduct pilot programs with some of the nation’s largest wealth management firms to offer a whitelabeled version of the everystory platform as a tool to assist the firms to improve rates of intergenerational client retention “ legacy program ” if the everystory legacy program is not successful or develops more slowly than everystory expects everystory’s business could be materially adversely affected              if we are not able to provide successful enhancements new features and modifications to our services our business could be adversely affected   our industry is marked by rapid technological developments and new and enhanced applications and services if we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our existing services or new services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments our business could be adversely affected the success of enhancements new features and services depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of such enhancements features or services failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our services are designed to operate on a variety of systems we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware mobile operating systems such as ios and android and other software communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion furthermore modifications to existing platforms or technologies will increase our research and development expenses any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business   our platform must integrate with a variety of operating systems and software applications that are developed by others and if we are unable to ensure that our solutions interoperate with such systems and applications our service may become less competitive and our operating results may be harmed   we offer our services across a variety of operating systems and through the internet we are dependent on the interoperability of our platform with thirdparty mobile devices desktop and mobile operating systems as well as web browsers that we do not control any changes in such systems devices or web browsers that degrade the functionality of our services or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our services in order to deliver high quality services it is important that they work well with a range of operating systems networks devices web browsers and standards that we do not control in addition because a substantial number of our users access our services through mobile devices we are particularly dependent on the interoperability of our services with mobile devices and operating systems we may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing services that operate effectively with these operating systems networks devices web browsers and standards in the event that it is difficult for our users to access and use our services our user growth may be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected   our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our members on personal computers and mobile devices if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change if internet access providers are able to block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services or if third parties disrupt access to the internet we could incur additional expenses and the loss of members and customers   our products and services depend on the ability of our members and customers to access the internet through their personal computers and mobile devices currently this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and governmentowned service providers any of whom could take actions that degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to our products or solutions which would in turn negatively impact our business in addition internet access could be disrupted by other third parties further the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws limiting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our subscription service or the usage of our services and increase our cost of doing business              one of our marketing strategies is to offer a limited free version of our service and we may not be able to realize the benefits of this strategy   we offer a limited version of our service to users free of charge in order to promote additional usage brand and product awareness and adoption some users never convert from a free version to a paid version of our service our marketing strategy also depends in part on persuading users who use the free version of our service to convince others to purchase and use our service to the extent that these users do not become or lead others to become paying customers we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing strategy and our ability to grow our business and revenue may be harmed   any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand   our success and ability to compete depend in part on our intellectual property as of may   everystory had one patent pending application in the us as everystory continues to develop its intellectual property it will file additional patent applications as appropriate we primarily rely on copyright trade secret and trademark laws trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees customers partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate our pending applications may not result in the issuance of patents if we file patent applications outside the us we may have to expend significant resources to obtain additional patents as we expand our international operations   in order to protect our intellectual property rights we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights accordingly we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property our failure to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business   we rely on third parties for certain financial and operational services essential to our ability to manage our business a failure or disruption in these services could materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively   we rely on third parties for certain essential financial and operational services traditionally the vast majority of these services have been provided by large enterprise software vendors who license their software to customers however we receive many of these services on a subscription basis from various softwareasaservice companies that are smaller and have shorter operating histories than traditional software vendors moreover these vendors provide their services to us via a cloudbased model instead of software that is installed on our premises as a result we depend upon these vendors providing us with services that are always available and are free of errors or defects that could cause disruptions in our business processes which would adversely affect our ability to operate and manage our operations   we focus on product innovation and user engagement rather than shortterm operating results   we focus on developing and launching new and innovative products and features as well as on improving the user experience for our services we also focus on growing the number of everystory users and paying organizations through indirect channel sales and through wordofmouth by individual users some of whom use our services at no cost we prioritize innovation and the experience for users on our platform as well as the growth of our user base over shortterm operating results we make product and service decisions that may reduce our shortterm operating results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve the user experience and to develop innovative features that we feel our users desire these decisions may not be consistent with the shortterm expectations of investors and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect   we plan to provide service level commitments under our subscription agreements if we fail to meet these contractual commitments we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face subscription terminations which could adversely affect our revenue furthermore any failure in our delivery of highquality customer support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results   we anticipate that our subscription agreements with customers will provide certain service level commitments if we are unable to meet these stated service level commitments or suffer periods of downtime that exceed the periods allowed under our customer agreements we may be obligated to provide these customers with service credits which could significantly impact our revenue in the period in which the downtime occurs and the credits could be due we could also face subscription terminations which could significantly impact both our current and future revenue any extended service outages could also adversely affect our reputation which would also impact our future revenue and operating results              our customers depend on our customer success organization to resolve technical issues relating to our services we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenue could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results in addition our sales process is highly dependent on the ease of use of our services on our reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality customer support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to sell our services to existing and prospective customers   our services contain open source software whose licenses may pose particular risks to our proprietary software products and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business   we use open source software in our services and will use open source software in the future additionally we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of or demanding release of the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software which could include our proprietary source code or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license these claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated services unless and until we can reengineer them to avoid infringement this reengineering process could require significant additional research and development resources and we may not be able to complete it successfully in addition to risks related to license requirements use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software additionally because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such software source code may be limited or lost entirely and we are unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and operating results   we plan to conduct a clinical trial of the use of our platform as a reminiscence therapy and digital therapeutic technique for treating patients with alzheimer’s disease and dementia but there is no guarantee that the trial will be successful or that the results will prove that the use of our platform as a treatment technique will be successful   as discussed we have been in negotiations with the university of california at san diego ucsd to conduct a clinical trial of the use of our platform as a reminiscence therapy and digital therapeutic technique for treating patients with alzheimer’s disease and dementia however there is no guarantee that the trial will be successful or that the results will prove that the use of our platform as a treatment technique will be successful additionally decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a therapy candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities once the therapy receives regulatory approval for example more detailed studies can lead to approval or acceptance for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process but each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit and the potential delays to approval of the primary indication trials also frequently do not achieve the primary endpoints set forth in the trial design management anticipates that the company will try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably foresee and address challenges but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time or at all the degree to which these challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results   as we enter the digital health and therapy market our business may be subject to government regulation and will be impacted by economic and business conditions which may have a negative impact on our ability to develop and implement our business strategy and our ability to continue operations   the digital healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products additionally the digital healthcare market is largely new and untested the uptake of products may not meet uptake projections as there is little to no prior data although digital healthcare products exist they are mostly focused on helping or focusing on aspects such as diet smoking cessation and medication management the categorization of our platform as a participant in the digital healthcare space will require successful research studies in addition the us health industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes the impacts of these regulations and the general market conditions could have a negative impact on our business and operations                future acquisitions and investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results   our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our services and grow our business in response to changing technologies customer demands and competitive pressures in some circumstances we may choose to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development the identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult timeconsuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions the risks we face in connection with acquisitions include   · diversion of management time and focus from operating the business to addressing acquisition integration challenges coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions · retention of key employees from the acquired company · cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization · integration of the acquired company’s accounting management information human resources and other administrative systems · the need to implement or improve controls procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls procedures and policies · liabilities for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including intellectual property infringement claims violations of laws commercial disputes tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities · unanticipated writeoffs or charges and · litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties   our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities amortization expenses incremental operating expenses or the writeoff of goodwill any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results   unfavorable general economic conditions in the united states or in other major markets could negatively impact our financial performance   unfavorable general economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or in other major markets could negatively affect the affordability of and consumer demand for our services under difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our services or by shifting away from our platform to lowerpriced products or services offered by other companies softer consumer demand for our services in the united states or in other major markets could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our financial performance   many individuals use mobile devices to access online services if users of these devices do not widely adopt the proprietary platform we develop for these devices or if we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices our business could be adversely affected   the number of people who access online services through mobile devices such as smart phones handheld tablets and mobile telephones as opposed to personal computers has increased dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase if the mobile solutions we have developed do not meet the needs of prospective and current customers they may not sign up or reduce their usage of our platform and our business could suffer additionally we are dependent on the interoperability of our proprietary platform with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control such as android and ios and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade our solutions’ functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect traffic and monetization on mobile devices we may not be successful in maintaining and developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the challenges we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices and we are devoting significant resources to the support and maintenance of such devices   our solutions and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors our business could be adversely affected   our solutions and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex in addition our solutions and internal systems depend on the ability of our software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data our software has contained and may now or in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors in our software may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors or other design defects within our software may result in a negative experience for members or customers delay product introductions or enhancements or result in measurement or other errors any errors bugs or defects discovered in our software could result in damage to our reputation loss of members loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results              we face competition in the market from social networking sites and internet search companies among others as well as continued competition for customers   we face significant competition in all aspects of our business and we expect such competition to increase particularly in the market for online professional networks and engagement of professionals   our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive larger and more established companies may focus on our market and could directly compete with us smaller companies including application developers could also launch new products and services that compete with us and that could gain market acceptance quickly we may also face competition if we shift our focus of development to new or different products or separate areas of our business   antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit any eventual market price of our common stock   provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that   · authorize our board of directors to issue without further action by the stockholders up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock · specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by the chair of our board of directors our president vice president secretary or assistant secretary and shall be called at the request of stockholders holding a majority of the capital stock of everystory and · provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office even though less than a quorum   these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management provisions in the indenture related to our convertible debt may also deter or prevent a business combination in addition institutional shareholder representative groups shareholder activists and others may disagree with our corporate governance provisions or other practices including our dual class structure and the other antitakeover provisions such as those listed above we generally will consider recommendations of institutional shareholder representative groups but we will make decisions based on what our board and management believe to be in the best long term interests of our company and stockholders our dual class structure concentrates the voting power of our stock in a small group of stockholders who would have the ability to control the outcome of a stockholder vote additionally these groups could make recommendations to our stockholders against our practices or our board members if they disagree with our positions finally because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section  of the delaware general corporation law which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder   the forward looking statements contained in this report may prove incorrect   this report contains certain forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements in addition to the other risks described elsewhere in this “risk factors” discussion important factors to consider in evaluating such forwardlooking statements include i changes to external competitive market factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations ii anticipated working capital or other cash requirements iii changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in our industry and iv various competitive factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace in light of these risks and uncertainties many of which are described in greater detail elsewhere in this “risk factors” discussion there can be no assurance that the events predicted in forwardlooking statements contained in this report will in fact transpire any negative change in the factors listed above could adversely affect the financial condition and operating results of everystory and its products              risks relating to ownership of our common stock   we have not paid and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and therefore unless our common stock appreciates in value our investors may not benefit from holding our common stock   we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since inception we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends our common stock in the foreseeable future as a result investors in our common stock will not be able to benefit from owning our common stock unless the market price of our common stock becomes greater than the price paid for the stock by investors   the public trading market for our common stock is volatile and may result in higher spreads in stock prices which may limit the ability of our investors to sell their shares at a profit if at all   our common stock trades in the overthecounter market and is quoted on the otcpink with little trading volume or activity the overthecounter market for securities has historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and result in substantial losses to our investors in addition the spreads on stock traded through the overthecounter market are generally unregulated and higher than on stock exchanges which means that the difference between the price at which shares could be purchased by investors in the overthecounter market compared to the price at which they could be subsequently sold would be greater than on these exchanges significant spreads between the bid and asked prices of the stock could continue during any period in which a sufficient volume of trading is unavailable or if the stock is quoted by an insignificant number of market makers historically our trading volume has been insufficient to significantly reduce this spread and we have had a limited number of market makers sufficient to affect this spread these higher spreads could adversely affect investors who purchase the shares at the higher price at which the shares are sold but subsequently sell the shares at the lower bid prices quoted by the brokers unless the bid price for the stock exceeds the price paid for the shares by the investor plus brokerage commissions or charges the investor could lose money on the sale for higher spreads such as those on overthecounter stocks this is likely a much greater percentage of the price of the stock than for exchange listed stocks there is no assurance that at the time an investor in our common stock wishes to sell the shares the bid price will have sufficiently increased to create a profit on the sale   we do not know whether a market for our common stock will be sustained or what the market price of our common stock will be and as a result it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock   although our common stock is eligible for quotation on the otc pink an active trading market for our shares has not commenced and may not be sustainable it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all as a result of these and other factors investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the offering price or at all further an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration if an active market for our common stock does not develop or is not sustained it may be difficult to sell your common stock   our board can without stockholder approval cause preferred stock to be issued on terms that adversely affect common stockholders or which could be used to resist a potential takeover of the company   under our articles of incorporation our board is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which are issued and outstanding also our board without stockholder approval may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares if the board causes shares of preferred stock to be issued the rights of the holders of our common stock could be adversely affected the board’s ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and to cause its issuance while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock preferred shares issued by the board could include voting rights or even super voting rights which could shift the ability to control the company to the holders of the preferred stock preferred shares could also have conversion rights into shares of common stock at a discount to the market price of the common stock which could negatively affect the market for our common stock in addition preferred shares would have preference in the event of liquidation of the corporation which means that the holders of preferred shares would be entitled to receive the net assets of the corporation distributed in liquidation before the common stock holders receive any distribution of the liquidated assets we have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock                the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly which could result in substantial losses by our investors   the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors some of which are beyond our control such as     · announcements of technological innovations new products or product enhancements by us or others     · announcements by us of significant strategic partnerships outlicensing inlicensing joint ventures acquisitions or capital commitments     · expiration or terminations of licenses research contracts or other collaboration agreements     · public concern as to the safety of products we our licensors or others develop     · success of research and development projects     · developments concerning intellectual property rights or regulatory approvals     · variations in our and our competitors’ results of operations     · changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts if our common stock is covered by analysts     · changes in government regulations or patent decisions     · developments by our licensors     · developments in the technology industry     · the results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits     · future issuances of common stock or other securities     · the addition or departure of key personnel     · announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions investments or strategic alliances     · general market conditions including the volatility of market prices for shares of technology companies generally and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance and     · the other factors described in this “risk factors” section   these factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and result in substantial losses by our investors   further the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in the past continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock price volatility of our common stock might be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low in the past following periods of market volatility stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation if we were involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and attention of management from our business even if we are successful future sales of our common stocks could also reduce the market price of such stock   moreover the liquidity of our common stock is limited not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price but by delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts’ and the media’s coverage of us if any these factors may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices for our common stock in addition without a large float our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in the absence of an active public trading market an investor may be unable to liquidate its investment in our common stock trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future   some or all of the “restricted” shares of our common stock issued in connection with the acquisition or held by other of our stockholders may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to an effective registration statement or rule  promulgated under regulation d of the securities act and these sales may have a depressive effect on the market for our common stock              raising additional capital by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders   we will need to raise substantial future capital to continue to complete development and commercialize our products incorporating licensed technologies and technology candidates and to conduct the research and development and regulatory activities necessary to bring our technology candidates to market   if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities we will reduce the percentage ownership of our thenexisting stockholders and these securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders   because our common stock may be a “penny stock” it may be more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected   our common stock may be a “penny stock” if among other things the stock price is below  per share it is not listed on a national securities exchange or it has not met certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements brokerdealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized riskdisclosure document prepared by the sec this document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the pennystock market a broker must also give a purchaser orally or in writing bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and obtain the purchaser’s written agreement to the purchase brokerdealers must also provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with such brokerdealer a monthly statement containing price and market information relating to the penny stock if a penny stock is sold to an investor in violation of the penny stock rules the investor may be able to cancel its purchase and get its money back   if applicable the penny stock rules may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock because of the rules and restrictions applicable to a penny stock there is less trading in penny stocks and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected also many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions accordingly investors may not always be able to resell their shares of our common stock publicly at times and prices that they feel are appropriate   item b unresolved staff comments   not applicable   item  properties   our principal offices are located at  carmel mountain road suite  san diego ca  the lease payments are  per month and are on a monthtomonth basis with no longterm lease in place management believes that the company is on good terms with the landlord and will continue to evaluate and balance the needs for office

to a vote of stockholders holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other securities there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock   dividends   we have not paid nor declared any cash dividends since our inception and do not intend to declare or pay any such dividends in the foreseeable future our

international had no compensation plans including individual compensation arrangements under which our common stock was authorized for issuance everystory had an incentive stock and stock option plan pursuant to which shares of everystory common stock were or could be issued however pursuant to the transaction with everystory all shares of everystory common stock were exchanged for shares of the company’s common stock additionally shares of our common stock were reserved for exchange with all holders of everystory derivative securities   the company’s management will review the adoption of an equity compensation plan in the future   item  selected financial data   as a “smaller reporting company” we have elected not to provide the disclosure required by this item   item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   overview   as noted above on september   we closed a share exchange transaction the “ transaction ” with everystory inc a privately held delaware corporation “ everystory ” and the shareholders of everystory pursuant to the transaction we agreed that the company’s prior operations and business would be sold off and that the company would focus on the everystory business and operations going forward as such historical descriptions of the company’s operations and business are no longer included in this overview   everystory business and platform   everystory is a secure private cloudbased story sharing platform the “ platform ” that allows users to create collaborative interactive that combine photos with unlimited audio thereby permanently saving the photos and the stories behind the photos in digital form once the stories are recorded they are safely and securely stored in the cloud where they can be privately shared with family and friends through the creation of private micro social networks in the context of the family everystory’s platform allows families to create a living and growing family history and archive of family stories that is secure and can be safely kept on the cloud indefinitely likewise for closelyknit groups of friends the everystory platform can provide a living chronicle of those friendships over the decades   everystory’s technology platform streamlines the creation of personalized digital stories and management is focused on the goal of becoming the first clinicallyproven digital therapeutic technology targeting patients with alzheimers disease and dementia everystory already has received a us patent issued in  that broadly covers the use of everystory’s technology in senior living facilities everystory is in the final stages of preparation to run a clinical trial with ucsd showing that everystory is an effective anxiety reduction and quality of life therapy for those with alzheimer’s disease or dementia “ adod ”              everystory conducts its operations from its facilities located in san diego california   plan of operations   revenue model   digital therapeutics business model   prior to the closing of the acquisition transaction with kmi everystory had been in negotiations with the university of california at san diego “ ucsd ” to conduct a clinical trial t o determine whether everystory and its reminiscence therapy and digital therapeutics technology and implementation techniques are an effective in reducing anxiety and as part of quality of life improvement therapy for those with alzheimer’s disease or dementia “ adod ”   assuming that the results of the clinical trial match the anecdotal evidence that everystory has observed and experienced once th e clinical trial has been completed and the data published everystory intends to offer the digital therapeutics technology directly to the families of adod patients as a clinical supported therapy additionally everystory intends to partner directly with senior living management firms and to offer a revenue sharing arrangement for the patients and families of the senior living firms that chooses to implement the therapy for their loved ones   in both the directtopatient and the senior livingmanagement models management anticipates that the

report on form k   item  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure   there is no disclosure required pursuant to this item  of form k   item a controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   our management with the participation of our prior principal executive and financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule de of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by rule db of the exchange act were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of the end of the period covered by the report we did not have a formal audit committee and there was a lack of segregation of duties   we believe that a control system no matter how well designed and operated cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected   management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of june   the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso  criteria  management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment   based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report   inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls   internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance interpretation of existing andor changing rules and principles segregation of management duties scale of organization and personnel factors internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate                changes in internal control over financial reporting
