conduit market remains mired in its twoyear slump defying predictions that the booming economy would cause outstandings to start growing again   as a whole conduits based in the us arent experiencing even the modest growth that their operators forecast at the beginning of this year such vehicles had  billion of their paper in the hands of investors on may  which is roughly the same as their jan  outstandings according to the federal reserve board   in january industry players predicted that the conduit market would finish  with  billion to  billion of outstandings that looks unlikely now and only the mostconservative estimates may prove accurate during one week in midmarch outstandings even dipped below  billion for the first time in a year   oddly enough the standstill is occurring at a time when demand for conduit paper is as strong as ever part of the problem is that companies are holding back on the sums they borrow from conduits choosing instead to tap other funding sources were seeing a reasonably normal volume in terms of transactions and conduit work its just that people arent drawing on the facilities said everett rutan a senior vice president at moodys   that could change if inflationary pressure leads the federal reserve to boost shortterm interest rates such a move would cause other sources of cheap funding to dry up prompting companies to return to the conduit market   bankers say that new accounting rules and pending regulatory requirements have presented the greatest barriers to growth for their conduits according to sp   the lack of growth is particularly pronounced at the markets largest shops the top  conduit operators had  billion of outstanding paper at yearend  down  billion from a year earlier according to moodys   ge capitals conduits shrank the most as the stamford conn lending giant continued to diversify its funding sources its conduits had  billion of outstandings at yearend down  billion from a year earlier that caused ge to slip four notches to eighth place among conduit administrators   citibank remained at the top of the heap even though its yearend conduit outstandings fell by  billion to  billion the perennial market leader lost ground to its closest rival abn amro which boosted outstandings by  billion to  billion   citibank also faces a substantial challenge this year from jp morgan chase which is scheduled to take over bank one at the end of june bank one is currently the markets numberthree administrator jp morgan slid to th place from th the combined banks would control more than  billion of conduit issues  putting jp morgan roughly on par with citi and abn   its not clear yet whether jp morgan plans to maintain such a large presence following the merger both banks supply substantial liquidity support to their conduits which likely purchase assets from many of the same clients  and jp morgan may take steps to avoid too much exposure to certain assets   despite ges pullback its mammoth edison asset securitization was still the markets largest conduit the multiseller vehicles outstandings totaled  billion at yearend down almost  billion from a year earlier abns amstel funding

stanley cup champions this date     �� edmonton oilers headlines      baseball poem   miracle man an original poem ��� by� holly russcher   i started thinking up this poem the day after robins first game back after his injury by styling it after casey at the bat i acknowledged not only one of baseballs best literary works but also the high expectations that soxfans had for robin that night much like those the mudville crowd had for their great slugger casey   casey failed to come through for his team what you are about to read is a different story     the night of july  at comiskey park some said a flame would be rekindled that had long lain cold and dead fans hoped to shout when all was done the white sox are on track but so far they simply whispered robin venturas coming back   that lefthanded home run hitter with warm smile and matchless heart four gold gloves hed won at third base with defense that looked like art nearly crippled in a freak mishap on march the twentyfirst now back eight days before schedule flouting all talk of the worst   the texas rangers would oppose the sox as chitown twilight fell when the home teams lineup was announced there came a joyous yell behind the plate the ump cried play ball the game duly began with disconcerting fashion a hit for texas leadoff man   doug drabek was apitching gold of hair and steel of eye a nohitter was beyond his scope but for shutout he would try hed also pitched the night when robin had been stricken down did that memory now haunt him as he stood upon the mound   nothingnothing was the score when robin first came to the plate and received a standing ovation which for a full minute did not abate he acknowledged it with a smile and wave which made the fans go wild so glad was he to play again that his face shone like a childs   we love you robin ventura we know youll make us proud cried the matriarchs and lasses present in that evenings crowd men rarely so demonstrative rose on their feet to say come on robin but he grounded out and walkednot limpedaway   in the stillscoreless seventh inning rangers hurler ken hill tired with frank thomas on he walked albert belle and then his luck expired for harold baines the quiet dh drove frank home without a word the sox led but robin had grounded out a second timeand third   matt karchner came in next to pitch and gave up a home run a worried hush fell on the fans who knew the scored been tied at one already the eighth inning did the sox not have a chance would this night of joy instead be one where texas got to dance   dave martinez ignored hills pitches and at last he drew a walk ozzie guillen bunted him to second announcer ed farmer began to talk durham next then ventura who so far is ohforthree ray durham hit into a groundout what now would the soxfans see   robin sauntered to his rightful place this was his last atbat facing a dreadful situation in his comeback game at that with one swing he could put the sox ahead if things went well but if he was the last out such a disgraceful tale to tell   hill stood on the mound in silence wound up and pitched the ball what occurred in the next instant was a shock to one and all ed farmers voice broke in wonder as these words his lips did yield hill with the pitchventura lines it deep left centerfield   its gonna get down and go to the warning track picked on a hop by rusty greer ventura doubles in martinez and the crowd took up the cheer praise for a valiant hero whod won hearts across the land as robin left the field in the ninth he tossed his cap into the stands   that night in other ballparks spoiled superstars had played ignoring fans and only caring for how much theyre paid and on the cheeks of their heartbroken fans tears of loathing burned but happy tears flow
