international value fund llc fund performance discussion in a volatile market environment the fund returned  during the reporting period on a relative basis the fund outperformed the msci all country ac world ex usa index the index which returned  the fund outperformed the index in eight out of ten sectors during the reporting period led by an underweight position in financials and stock selection in materials information technology and consumer discretionary the fund underperformed the index within industrials and utilities largely due to stock selection market overview the oneyear reporting period was a tumultuous time for global equity markets numerous concerns resulted in volatile global equity markets during the reporting period including the impact of slowing chinese growth on commodities prices and the global economy greeces debt situation the strength of the us dollar along with the timing and impact of us interest rate hikes these factors created risk onrisk off market environments   which tend to obscure fundamentals and increase market volatility finally in december the us federal reserve the fed enacted their longawaited rate rise to mixed reviews in addition plummeting energy prices decelerating emerging market growth and sluggish developed market growth all contributed to an environment where investor sentiment swung back and forth like a pendulum to close        comparison of change in value of  hypothetical investments in             oppenheimer master international value fund llc volatility continued in the first four months of  adding to concerns over chinas slowing economy and falling crude oil prices were concerns of slowing global and domestic economic growth however sentiment improved in march as the fed began to hint at lowering the trajectory of rate rises oil prices stabilized commodities which have been declining from their super cycle peak for some time rallied fund review top performing holdings of the fund this reporting period included adidas ag alphabet inc and japan tobacco inc while not appearing to be a traditional value stock adidas was a contrarian buy just over a year ago investors had become disenchanted with adidas by the fall of  as it was losing market share to nike and under armour was exposed to russia and had overpaid for taylormade however we felt there might be too much pessimism around this venerable brand the company quietly began to buy back its own shares this move combined with a logical strategy to streamlinereorganize the marketing and rd budgets under product managers rather than regional sales heads was the catalyst for us to get involved we then met with the head of global brands an american from wisconsin who articulated the companys strategy for north america which led us to increase our positon making it one of the funds largest the shares have performed well because of strong results in china stabilization in russia and the announcement of a new ceo who is highly regarded alphabet is the new name for google tremendous value was released in  when the company announced that it was reorganizing itself into a holding companyalphabetwith separate subsidiaries for its various endeavors it completed that process in october and announced strong earnings in its core search business mobile advertising growth was strong while the pace of cost rises slowed we continue to see significant value in the company after trading sideways for one year paying a nice dividend japan tobaccos shares have performed well because of the companys robust cash generating ability rising dividend and share buybacks more recently the company has benefited from a price hike for its premium mevius formerly mild  brand we think there is ample room to raise prices in japan where a pack of cigarettes sells for less than half the price in the us and uk top detractors from performance included rakuten inc rollsroyce holdings plc and sk telecom co ltd rakuten inc an ecommerce leader in japan had been a good performer for the fund from early  until the spring of last year competition from amazon and a reinvigorated yahoo japan has taken a toll on growth and profit margins while forays into new overseas businesses remain unprofitable rakuten also has a large credit card business which has been negatively impacted by the extremely low interest rate environment we did reduce our position but remain shareholders as the           oppenheimer master international value fund llc underlying ecommerce business remains a market leader in japan and is highly cash generative rollsroyce holdings plc is the british maker of aircraft jet engines its main business over the past two years the share price has suffered from a perfect storm of slow demand in the marine businesswhich is energyrelated a soft military aerospace market poorly understood accounting poor communication to investors and kitchen sink writeoffs after new management took over this past year we have bought into the company as its stock price has come down in our opinion the long term demand outlook for air traveland therefore civil aircraftis very strong and rollsroyce is well placed to compete strongly against ge the other major supplier of jet engines in the world sk telecom is the leading mobile telecommunications provider in south korea during the reporting period the company announced earnings that were somewhat disappointing sk telecoms customers have upgraded to g services more slowly than expected that along with intense market competition has inhibited growth in revenues per user we are closely watching the evolution in the south korean mobile telecommunications market and sk telecoms behavior within it strategy  outlook the fund continues to maintain a bottomup approach to investing along with following the longterm thematic investment philosophy of the oppenheimerfunds global equity team with its focus on mass affluence new technology restructuring and aging by focusing on company fundamentals understanding the relationship between macroeconomic and microeconomic catalysts and ignoring shortterm noise we have found new opportunities amid market volatility the fund remains focused on international companies that we believe have durable advantages but are undervalued relative to their peers their historic valuations

contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions and  ongoing costs including management fees distribution and service fees and other fund expenses these examples are intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the examples are based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire month period ended april   actual expenses the first section of the table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this section together with the amount you invested to estimate the expense that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled expenses paid during  months ended april   to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second section of the table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the

example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as frontend or contingent deferred sales charges loads therefore the hypothetical section of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not

equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies arise from changes in

investments is separately identified from the fluctuations arising from changes in market values of securities held and reported with all other foreign currency gains and losses in the funds statement of operations investment income dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date or upon exdividend notification in the case of certain foreign dividends where the exdividend date may have

which are included in interest income on the statement of operations are amortized or accreted daily custodian fees custodian fees and expenses in the statement of operations may include interest expense incurred by the fund on any cash overdrafts of its custodian account during the period such cash overdrafts may result from the effects of failed trades in portfolio securities and from cash outflows resulting from unanticipated shareholder redemption activity the fund pays interest to its custodian on such cash overdrafts to the extent they are not offset by positive cash balances maintained by the fund at a rate equal to the federal funds rate plus  the reduction to custodian expenses line item if applicable represents earnings on cash balances maintained by the fund during the period such interest expense and other custodian fees may be paid with these earnings security transactions security transactions are recorded on the trade date realized gains and losses on

against liabilities arising in connection with the performance of their duties to the fund in the normal course of business the fund may also enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications the funds maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would be dependent on future claims that may be made against the fund the risk of material loss from such claims is considered remote federal taxes the fund as an entity will not be subject to us federal income tax the fund will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership and not as an association taxable

items of fund income gains losses and deductions for such taxable year of the fund a shareholder must take such items into account even if the fund does not distribute cash or other property to such shareholder during its taxable year although the fund is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes it is intended that the funds assets income and distributions will be managed in such a way that investment in the fund would not cause an investor that is a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code ric to fail that qualification use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and

the case of a scheduled early closing of the exchange in which case the fund will calculate net asset value of the shares as of the scheduled early closing time of the exchange the funds board has adopted procedures for the valuation of the funds securities and has delegated the daytoday responsibility for valuation determinations under those procedures to the manager the manager has established a valuation committee which is responsible for determining a fair valuation for any security for which market quotations are not readily available the valuation committees fair valuation determinations are subject to review approval and ratification by the funds board at its next regularly scheduled meeting covering the calendar quarter in which the fair valuation was determined valuation methods and inputs securities are valued using unadjusted quoted market prices when available as supplied primarily by third party pricing services or dealers the following methodologies are used to determine the market value or the fair value of the types of securities described below securities traded on a registered us securities exchange including exchangetraded derivatives other than futures and futures options are valued based on the last sale price of the security reported on the principal exchange on which it is traded prior to the time when the funds assets are valued in the absence of a sale the security is valued at the mean between the bid and asked price on the principal exchange or if not available from the principal exchange obtained from two dealers if bid and asked prices are not available from either the exchange or two dealers the security is valued by using one of the following methodologies listed in order of priority  a bid from

security is valued at the most recent official closing price on the principal exchange on which it is traded if the last sales price or official closing price for a foreign security is not available the security is valued at the mean between the bid and asked price per the exchange or if not available from the exchange obtained from two dealers if bid and asked prices are not available from

changes in an appropriate securities index or changes in the value of similar securities which may be further adjusted for any discounts related to securityspecific resale restrictions when possible such methodologies use observable market inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices of similar securities observable interest rates currency rates and yield curves the methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those securities nor can it be assured that the fund can obtain the fair value assigned to a security if it were to sell the security to assess the continuing appropriateness of security valuations the manager or its third party service provider who is subject to oversight by the manager regularly compares prior day prices prices on comparable securities and sale prices to the current day prices and challenges those prices exceeding certain tolerance levels with the third party pricing service or broker

investing the fund may invest in foreign securities which are subject to special risks securities traded in foreign markets may be less liquid and more volatile than those traded in us markets foreign issuers are usually not subject to the same accounting and disclosure requirements that us companies are subject to which may make it difficult for the fund to evaluate a foreign companys operations or financial condition a change in         oppenheimer master international value fund llc notes to financial statements continued    investments and risks continued   the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a change in the us dollar value of investments denominated in that foreign currency and in the value of any income or distributions the fund may receive on those investments the value of foreign investments may be affected by exchange control regulations foreign taxes higher transaction and other costs delays in the settlement of transactions changes in economic or monetary policy in the united states or abroad expropriation or nationalization of a companys assets or other political and economic factors in addition due to the interrelationship of global economies and financial markets changes in political and economic factors in one country or region could adversely affect conditions in another country or region investments in foreign securities may also expose the fund to timezone arbitrage risk foreign securities may trade on weekends or other days when the fund does not price its shares at times the fund may emphasize investments in a particular country or region and may be subject to greater risks from adverse events that occur in that country or region foreign securities and foreign currencies held in foreign banks and securities depositories may be subject to limited or no regulatory oversight investments in affiliated funds the fund is permitted to invest in other mutual funds advised by the manager affiliated funds affiliated funds are openend management investment companies registered under the  act as amended the manager is the investment adviser of and the subadviser provides investment and related advisory services to the affiliated funds when applicable the funds investments in affiliated funds are included in the statement of investments shares of affiliated funds are valued at their net asset value per share as a shareholder the fund is subject to its proportional share of the affiliated funds expenses including their management fee the manager will waive fees and or reimburse fund expenses in an amount equal to the indirect management fees incurred through the funds investment in the affiliated funds each of the affiliated funds in which the fund invests has its own investment risks and those risks can affect the value of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares to the extent that the fund invests more of its assets in one affiliated fund than in another the fund will have greater exposure to the risks of that affiliated fund investment in oppenheimer institutional money market fund the fund is permitted to invest daily available cash balances in a money market affiliated fund the fund may invest the available cash in class e shares of oppenheimer institutional money market fund immf to seek current income while preserving liquidity or for defensive purposes immf is regulated as a money market fund under the investment company act of  as amended equity security risk stocks and other equity securities fluctuate in price the value of the funds portfolio may be affected by changes in the equity markets generally equity markets may experience significant shortterm volatility and may fall sharply at times different markets may behave differently from each other and us equity markets may move in the opposite direction from one or more foreign stock markets adverse events in any part of the equity or fixedincome markets may have unexpected negative effects on other market segments         oppenheimer master international value fund llc      investments and risks continued   the prices of individual equity securities generally do not all move in the same direction at the same time and a variety of factors can affect the price of a particular companys securities these factors may include but are not limited to poor earnings reports a loss of customers litigation against the company general unfavorable performance of the companys sector or industry or changes in government regulations affecting the company or its industry      market risk factors the funds investments in securities andor financial derivatives may expose the fund to various market risk factors commodity risk commodity risk relates to the change in value of commodities or commodity indexes as they relate to increases or decreases in the commodities market commodities are physical assets that have tangible properties examples of these types of assets are crude oil heating oil metals livestock and agricultural products credit risk credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer of debt to meet interest and principal payments or both as they come due in general lowergrade higheryield debt securities are subject to credit risk to a greater extent than loweryield higherquality securities equity risk equity risk relates to the change in value of equity securities as they relate to increases or decreases in the general market foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange rate risk relates to the change in the us dollar value of a security held that is denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar value of a foreign currency denominated security will decrease as the dollar appreciates against the currency while the us dollar value will increase as the dollar depreciates against the currency interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the fluctuations in value of fixedincome securities resulting from the inverse relationship between price and yield for example an increase in general interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of already issued fixedincome investments and a decline in general interest rates will tend to increase their value in addition debt securities with longer maturities which tend to have higher yields are subject to potentially greater fluctuations in value from changes in interest rates than obligations with shorter maturities volatility risk volatility risk refers to the magnitude of the movement but not the direction of the movement in a financial instruments price over a defined time period large increases or decreases in a financial instruments price over a relative time period typically indicate greater volatility risk while small increases or decreases in its price typically indicate lower volatility risk      use of derivatives the funds investment objective not only permits the fund to purchase investment securities it also allows the fund to enter into various types of derivatives contracts including but not limited to futures contracts forward currency exchange contracts credit default swaps         oppenheimer master international value fund llc notes to financial statements continued    use of derivatives continued   interest rate swaps total return swaps variance swaps and purchased and written options in doing so the fund will employ strategies in differing combinations to permit it to increase decrease or change the level or types of exposure to market risk factors these instruments may allow the fund to pursue its objectives more quickly and efficiently than if it were to make direct purchases or sales of securities capable of effecting a similar response to market factors such contracts may be entered into through a bilateral overthecounter otc transaction or through a securities or futures exchange and cleared through a clearinghouse derivatives may have little or no initial cash investment relative to their market value exposure and therefore can produce significant gains or losses in excess of their cost due to unanticipated changes in the market risk factors and the overall market this use of embedded leverage allows the fund to increase its market value exposure relative to its net assets and can substantially increase the volatility of the funds performance in instances where the fund is using derivatives to decrease or hedge exposures to market risk factors for securities held by the fund there are also risks that those derivatives may not perform as expected resulting in losses for the combined or hedged positions some derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss regardless of the size of the funds initial investment additional associated risks from investing in derivatives also exist and potentially could have significant effects on the valuation of the derivative and the fund typically the associated risks are not the risks that the fund is attempting to increase or decrease exposure to per its investment objectives but are the additional risks from investing in derivatives examples of these associated risks are liquidity risk which is the risk that the fund will not be able to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner and counterparty credit risk which is the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the fund the funds actual exposures to these market risk factors and associated risks during the period are discussed in further detail by derivative type below forward currency exchange contracts the fund may enter into forward currency exchange contracts forward contracts for the purchase or sale of a foreign currency at a negotiated rate at a future date such contracts are traded in the otc interbank currency dealer market forward contracts are reported on a schedule following the statement of investments the unrealized appreciation depreciation is reported in the statement of assets and liabilities as a receivable or payable and in the statement of operations within the change in unrealized appreciation depreciation at contract close the difference between the original cost of the contract and the value at the close date is recorded as a realized gain loss in the statement of operations the fund has entered into forward contracts with the obligation to purchase specified foreign currencies in the future at a currently negotiated forward rate in order to decrease exposure to foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated securities held by the fund the fund has entered into forward contracts with the obligation to sell specified foreign currencies in the future at a currently negotiated forward rate in order to decrease exposure to         oppenheimer master international value fund llc      use of derivatives continued   foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated securities held by the fund during the reporting period the fund had daily average contract amounts on forward contracts to buy and sell of  and  respectively additional associated risk to the fund includes counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty to a forward contract will default and fail to perform its obligations to the fund counterparty credit risk derivative positions are subject to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the fund the fund intends to enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that the manager believes to be creditworthy at the time of the transaction the funds risk of loss from counterparty credit risk on otc derivatives is generally limited to the aggregate unrealized gain netted against any collateral held by the fund for otc options purchased the fund bears the risk of loss of the amount of the premiums paid plus the positive change in market values net of any collateral held by the fund should the counterparty fail to perform under the contracts options written by the fund do not typically give rise to counterparty credit risk as options written generally obligate the fund and not the counterparty to perform to reduce counterparty risk with respect to otc transactions the fund has entered into master netting arrangements established within the funds international swap and derivatives association inc isda master agreements which allow the fund to make or to have an entitlement to receive a single net payment in the event of default closeout netting for outstanding payables and receivables with respect to certain otc positions in swaps options swaptions and forward currency exchange contracts for each individual counterparty in addition the fund may require that certain counterparties post cash andor securities in collateral accounts to cover their net payment obligations for those derivative contracts subject to isda master agreements if the counterparty fails to perform under these contracts and agreements the cash andor securities will be made available to the fund isda master agreements include credit related contingent features which allow counterparties to otc derivatives to terminate derivative contracts prior to maturity in the event that for example the funds net assets decline by a stated percentage or the fund fails to meet the terms of its isda master agreements which would cause the fund to accelerate payment of any net liability owed to the counterparty for financial reporting purposes the fund does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities that are subject to netting arrangements in the statement of assets and liabilities bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may impose restrictions on or prohibitions against the right of offset in bankruptcy insolvency or other events the funds risk of loss from counterparty credit risk on exchangetraded derivatives cleared through a clearinghouse and for centrally cleared swaps is generally considered lower than as compared to otc derivatives however counterparty credit risk exists with respect to

use of derivatives continued   broker andor clearinghouse accounts for such exchangetraded derivatives and for centrally cleared swaps with respect to centrally cleared swaps such transactions will be submitted for clearing and if cleared will be held in accounts at futures commission merchants or brokers that are members of clearinghouses while brokers futures commission merchants and clearinghouses are required to segregate customer margin from their own assets in the event that a broker futures commission merchant or clearinghouse becomes insolvent or goes into bankruptcy and at that time there is a shortfall in the aggregate amount of margin held by the broker futures commission merchant or clearinghouse for all its customers us bankruptcy laws will typically allocate that shortfall on a prorata basis across all the brokers futures commission merchants or clearinghouses customers potentially resulting in losses to the fund there is the risk that a broker futures commission merchant or clearinghouse will decline to clear a transaction on the funds behalf and the fund may be required to pay a termination fee to the executing broker with whom the fund initially enters into the transaction clearinghouses may also be permitted to terminate centrally cleared swaps at any time the fund is also subject to the risk that the broker or futures commission merchant will improperly use the funds assets depositedpaid as initial or variation margin to satisfy payment obligations of another customer in the event of a default by another customer of the broker or futures commission merchant the fund might not receive its variation margin payments from the clearinghouse due to the manner in which variation margin payments are aggregated for all customers of the brokerfutures commission merchant collateral and margin requirements differ by type of derivative margin requirements are established by the broker futures commission merchant or clearinghouse for exchangetraded and cleared derivatives including centrally cleared swaps brokers futures commission merchants and clearinghouses can ask for margin in excess of the regulatory minimum or increase the margin amount in certain circumstances collateral terms are contract specific for otc derivatives for derivatives traded under an isda master agreement the collateral requirements are typically calculated by netting the mark to market amount for each transaction under such agreement and comparing that amount to the value of any collateral currently pledged by the fund or the counterparty for financial reporting purposes cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the fund if any is reported separately on the statement of assets and liabilities as cash pledged as collateral noncash collateral pledged by the fund if any is noted in the statement of investments generally the amount of collateral due from or to a party must exceed a minimum transfer amount threshold eg  before a transfer has to be made to the extent amounts due to the fund from its counterparties are not fully collateralized contractually or otherwise the fund bears the risk of loss
