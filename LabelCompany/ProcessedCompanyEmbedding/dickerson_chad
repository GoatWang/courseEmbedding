strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × how chad dickerson grew etsy took it public and became the most important man in new york tech this year jillian donfro oct    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print    the day etsy went public nasdaq on the day that brooklynbased etsy went public ceo chad dickerson rang the nasdaq bell while wearing an outfit sourced entirely from the company’s own craft website from his suit coat down to his socks including a pair of baseball cuff links along with dickerson and cfo kristina salen  people who run stores on the website jangled handmade and vintage bells bought on etsy of course the stock immediately popped — rocketing from an opening price of  up to  per share by the time markets closed — but the best part of the day for dickerson had more to do with those gathered around him than any big numbers besides including sellers at the stock exchange and holding a craft marketplace in new york city afterward etsy also chose to make  of its shares available to individual investors allowing normal people not just big banks to get in on the action etsy is very much a communitybased business dickerson tells business insider what we’re really trying to do is build an etsy economy thats about connecting people even though its first few quarters on the stock market have bruised etsy — the stock has sunk about  to  per share — dickerson doesnt let that bother him as long as the company is keeping its eyes locked on its ultimate vision of building a more authentic communitycentric marketplace he says he keeps his constituents in mind — etsys customers shareholders and employees — but ignores the stock price many companies that go public their first year or so out of the gate is volatile but the important thing is that we’re building a longterm business he says the rigor of being a public company makes us more disciplined and focused on mission we talked to dickerson who topped our  sai  list of the biggest names in new york tech about his biggest business lessons most important epiphanies and why silicon valley isnt the only good place to build a tech company never fear growth etsy ceo chad dickerson etsy dickerson first learned about etsy when a former colleague flickr founder caterina fake called to woo him into meeting the team he says he connected so well with etsys culture and mission that he bid farewell to silicon valley and his job at yahoo to become the startups chief technology officer in  etsy was only  years old with less than  employees at the time in  the board made him ceo while transitioning from cto of a tiny startup to the ceo of a nearly person public company dickerson has had several big revelations about being a leader and growing a company first you cant fear growth or the change that comes with it for example many employees bemoan the day they realize that their company has become so big that they cant remember everyones names dickerson remembers when one of etsys engineers first made that same complaint but instead of complacently accepting the issue that person hacked together a quiz game for the companys intranet that allowed employees to practice putting names to faces he had gamefied the problem etsy employees performing etsy since etsy has also developed a program called manager mixer that randomly pairs up employees to have lunch together theyre often surprised when they discover that dickerson actually participates and every year etsy hosts a companywide talent show highlighting the diversity of talent and personalities that its hundreds of employees bring to the table as companies grow people tend to focus on the negative aspects of what that means he says but when you dont fear growth but embrace it and organize around it you can do some interesting things that works on the business side as well as culturally about two years ago etsy started allowing sellers to hire additional employees and work with outside manufacturers as long as they listed the information on their about page and retained authorship and responsibility over the products made a firestorm erupted because some sellers with singleperson operations felt like they wouldnt be able to keep up deluxe screen printing a small factory in la can work with etsy sellers through its manufacturing program etsy but dickerson argues the manufacturing rule has allowed very successful sellers who wouldnt be able to keep up with demand if they had to work alone stay on the site it sounds like a scary change at first but it allows businesses to scale etsy wouldnt be as inclusive diverse or interesting as a website if it didnt remain open to growing businesses according to the company that brings us to lesson two as a leader you need to be incredibly resilient no decision you make is ever going to make everyone happy dickerson says speaking in particular about etsys introduction of manufacturing rules in the cases where youre going against conventional wisdom you have to be prepared to take shortterm criticism in the name of longterm growth and development to do anything great you have to be tough why new york etsys owl mascot inside its brooklyn office business insider  jillian donfro another one of dickersons unconventional choices was leaving a big west coast company like yahoo for a tiny new york startup at a time when the tech scene there was pretty sleepy but after his successful meeting with etsy dickerson stumbled upon a bon jovi concert in central park and the magic of the city struck him in new york you can ship code during the day and go see a broadway show at night working late and need to refuel no problem amazing local restaurants will still be open not just the neighborhood dennys what new york has that no one else has is this really global perspective and some of the most important cultural institutions in the world he says you have art culture media fashion music as well as all the ingredients for a firstclass tech ecosystem new york will never be a oneindustry town and as a tech person working in new york thats the most exciting thing today he says with the increase of startup investors in manhattan and the opening of cornells tech campus on roosevelt island bringing in new engineering talent new york city tech has a bright future we have all the ingredients he says i think that were really just at the beginning of a burst of hugely valuable companies in new york see also how getting rid of individual trash cans changed etsys culture now watch

for etsychad dickerson chief executive of etsy chad dickerson is the chief executive of etsy an online marketplace for handmade and vintage finds mr dickerson was formerly the director of brickhouse an advanced products team at yahoo prior to working at yahoo mr dickerson worked on early webbased newspapers including saloncom the following is an edited interview with him q when you were at yahoo you started yahoo hack day right a well there had been internal hack days at yahoo for some time these were done with the support of upper management bradley horowitz — who is now at google — and i created the first external one hack day was important because it really represented subverting the normal corporate process q how did the external yahoo hack day happen a we pretty much went off the reservation we didn’t really tell upper management and we put up a web site announcing it and then invited beck to play a concert it worked out in the end but there was a moment when i thought we were going to get fired q so you were chief technology officer at etsy before becoming chief executive right a yes i became ceo last july but have been working at etsy since september  as cto q is this your first time as a chief executive a i’ve actually always been an entrepreneur and very businessminded in many ways my career as a technologist was the anomaly though that was how people knew me professionally i started coding after graduating from college with an english lit degree and ended up at an early newspaper on the web “we had a threearmed sweater made for one of our engineers who committed the most spectacular mistake of the year” q what made you come to etsy a i got a call from caterina fake who had founded flickr we used to work together at yahoo and at saloncom in the late ’s i came out here and met the team and i had this strong sense that i didn’t want to just give the team advice but i actually wanted to help coming from yahoo and these hack days when i looked at etsy it looked like it was hacking the world q do you see your employees as hackers a absolutely the internals of the company really embody the hacker spirit the empowerment of the company is really on the edges for example we have  engineers and any single engineer can deploy code to the live site at any time it happens about  times a day q wait anyone can upload code at anytime has this ever gone awry a of course we do blameless postmortems about it all the time — which is incredibly important we believe that if you have a blameless process you actually get to the root of the problem quicker and people don’t feel like they have to hide information we don’t enjoy making mistakes but we give an award to the person who makes the most spectacle mistake q what kind of awards a we had a threearmed sweater made for one of our engineers who committed the most spectacular mistake of the year he essentially disabled any etsy employee from accessing the site q so why did you take over a chief executive a the etsy board asked me to be ceo as ceo it’s really helpful to understand the technology side but there is almost no overlap with my former role the one thing a ceo can do is really set the cultural principles q what has been the hardest lesson as chief executive a president harry truman had a sign on his desk that said “the bucks stop here” as ceo every buck stops here it’s not harder but a completely different perspective q is etsy profitable a we’re relatively flat so it’s an incredibly healthy business our success is based on the greater success of other people — the people who sell on etsy we’re really helping the economy in this way last year we sold  million in products on the platform the transaction fee is  percent so  percent of the sales go to the sellers q do you worry that the maker movement is a fad a i don’t think it’s a fad at all i think the internet is making it easier than ever for people to make things and it has never been easier to connect with other people to learn how to make things etsy is also an educational institution people come to etsy to learn how to make things q do you personally make things a i make beer i make music i’m an intermediate guitar player suitable for campfires i really enjoy writing — that’s a certain type of making whats next loading previous post daily report yahoo data shows depth of challenge mayer faces

earnings today after being a leader at etsys for nine years ill be stepping down as the ceo over the past  years etsys achieved tremendous growth and success after successfully navigating the challenges of going from the small startup to an established leader and innovator etsy is now entering its next phase of growth and development the board has decided now is the right time for new leadership to take etsys forward and i support the decision josh silverman a member of our board of directors since november will be leading etsy going forward with nearly  years of product development marketing and ecommerce experience josh have been established track record leading and growing consumer technology companies and scaling global market places i got to know josh over the past several months and i know etsy will be in great hand with josh at the helm josh is joining us today and before jennifer and i discuss our results for the quarter i will turn the call over to josh for some brief remarks josh josh silverman thanks chad first i want to thank chad for his leadership over the past nine years we altered etsy into a period of high growth he took us to the ipo and he helped to make etsy into the world class company and global place it is today his efforts have laid the foundation for etsy future success and i know has always been committed to delivering value for our stakeholders from buyers and sellers to employees and shareholders when i joined the board in november i was excited to be a part of a company like etsy and as a member of the board ive gained a deep appreciation for the fundamental strength of etsy business etsys employees and attractive market opportunities etsy has already accomplished so much of over the past  years building a twosided market place that offers a differentiated value proposition for buyers and a unique opportunity for sellers is difficult to do etsy has done that creating a strong technology platform and cultivating powerful loyalty driven by a robust seller community and offering a board product inventory were going to continue to sharpen our focus on raising awareness among new buyers and getting our existing buyers to make more frequent purchases as we head into our next phase of growth i want to leverage the many things etsy as done well thus far which include a strong core organic markets business a thriving sellers services business and a world class technology platform and i want to build new muscles where we can do even better such as delivering a best in class buyer experience and improving our marketing capabilities though we have a lot of work to do we have a great culture and talented employees who i know are up the challenge over the coming weeks i will be listening and learning from our employees sellers buyers and investors and deep diving into our operating plans to make sure that we’re focusing on the value enhancing near and longterm opportunities i believe that we have significant opportunity to continue to grow and to drive our financial performance im energized by the etsy teams sense of urgency culture of committing to our sellers and buyers and drive for operational excellence im excited to work with the leadership team to capture etsy exciting growth opportunities and i look forward to providing additional updates next quarter now ill turn the call back to chad to discuss the first quarter chad dickerson the first quarter was challenging in february our average converting visit value conversion rates and visits came in below our expectations resulting in gmf well below our forecast for that amount well march was better to  gmf growth and  revenue growth we delivered for the quarter were both lower than we expected as difficult as the quarter was weve already made important progress this year we launched shop manager a centralized hub for sellers to manage their businesses we expect shop manager to help increase the awareness of etsy services among our sellers we launched etsy studio our new craft suppliers market which offers a disruptive online alternative to the historically offline crafts shopping experience and we begin rolling out significant enhancements to product search and discovery these efforts give us confidence in our ability to driver growth going forward were taking steps to ensure our business to set up to support etsy next stage of growth last year our coo linda findley kozlowski let a realignment of our internal structure which organized our markets and sell our services teams under general mangers who lead core products and business teams these changes sharpened crossfunctional collaboration increased accountability and led to faster product launches and tests with this solid foundation in place over the past quarters we looked holistically across the business to identify opportunities to increase our efficiency and streamline our cost structure as a result of this process weve identified savings that will be realized through a combination of headcount reductions and a reduction in internal program expenses in total we expect to eliminate approximately  positions which is approximately  of the total workforce while decisions like these are never easy we believe these actions will allow us to drive productivity and invest more in key growth opportunities now i’d like to walk you through some of our recent progress and discuss our focus areas in markets and seller services staring with our markets with the etsy markets there are two key differentiators that service opportunities to drive growth first most visits are from organic channels while organic traffic is an indicator of strong engagement and brand affinity we cannot rely on this channel to continue to grow on its own the work we are doing across marketing and products will drive paid traffic and gms and improve the full product experience to help to improve organic traffic performance and conversion given the size of our organic reach this represents a significant optimization opportunity second the etsy market has more than  million listings with millions of one of a kind items or limited inventory this presents one of the most complex tech challenges in ecommerce which we are uniquely positioned to meet there is significant opportunities to use machine learning to improve our search and recommendations engines which we believe will help buyers discover and buy even more items on etsy for long clo ph unique items to beautiful high quality everyday goods so here is how we move the needle on these two big challenges and opportunities to drive gms the key to our market strategy is bringing new buyers to etsy and also getting existing buyers to make more frequent purchases we learned a lot from our first brand campaign and we plan to continue to refine our marketing plan and approach both brand and acquisition marketing while our marketing was designed to drive buyer interest creating an engaging and easy to use product experience is critical for turning this interest into a transaction as such encouraging conversion will remain a key priority were making product enhancements particularly within search that improve the shopping experience over the past few years weve invested in product enhancements in our mobile capabilities to improve each step of the buyer journey this has resulted in sixth consecutive quarters of conversion rate gains across desktop mobile web and mobile apps as well as the slight narrowing of the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms in the first quarter and for the first time ever more than half of our gms came from the mobile device building on this work we see search as the key area where we can augment our capabilities in order to further drive conversion many of youve asked about our integration plans for blackbird technologies following our acquisition of the machine learning company last fall im pleased to report that last week we initiated our first public test in the etsy market that leverages their capabilities weve added new facets and filters to our popular jewelry category making it easier for buyers to drill down and achieve subcategories like rings and necklaces or narrow their search by attribute such as gemstone or material we plan to rollout facets and filters across most of our major categories on etsy by the end of the year were also using blackboards expertise to help surface and recommend relevant items to buyers especially when one of the kind items are sold out we believe these improvements for the search and discovery process will drive sales and conversion and make buyers want to return to our markets i also wanted to touch on etsy studio which officially launched to the public last week with nearly  million items alongside inspiring shoppable content we believe that etsy studio is the unique offering within a huge industry that once study estimates to be over  billion in the us along as we continue to nurture and bring more buyers to our market we’re also making easier for sellers to start manage and scale their businesses seller services revenue continues to grow robustly and was up  yearoveryear in the first quarter getting a seller to her first sale quickly and helping her manage the complexities of her growing business is the top priority to do this were building a comprehensive suite of services and tools that address key pinging point at sellers space and were creating a platform from which she can run entire business over the past few years we created a payment platform where etsy sellers and buyers are able to seamlessly transact recently we rebranded direct checkout as etsy payments starting later this month well require the all sellers in eligible countries transition to etsy payments we believe etsy payments is beneficial for our sellers as buyers are more likely to complete a transaction with sellers who use this service we’ve made enhancements that demonstrate our ability to address specific sellers needs our new shop manager tool is a centralized hub where sellers can manage listings and orders and track the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns all in one convenient place this also enables many sellers to discover and take advantage of our entire suite of paid and free service and tools like pattern quick books and shipping labels we think shop manager has the potential to transform the way sellers think about etsy were not just the place for them to start a shop but instead of business platform that will support them no matter where or how they chose to grow their business ultimately we believe there are seller services strategy will allow us to continue to grow our sellers service revenue stream and with shop manager build a platform that grows with our creative entrepreneurs in closing etsy has a significant run way for growth and were taking important steps to become strong more nimble and better equipped to capitalize on our opportunities we’re making investments in key areas of our business while maintaining a prudent cost structure and gaining leverage across our operating expenses im excited about etsys future and i look forward to following its many successes in the quarters and years to come with that ill turn the call over to jennifer to walk through our financial results jennifer jennifer beugelmans thanks chad and hello everyone just a heads up the comparisons ill be referencing to are on a yearoveryear basis unless specially noted lets start with gms during the first quarter of  etsys generated  million in gms up  driven by growth in active sellers and active buyers at the end of the first quarter etsy had over  million active sellers up about  also at the end of the first quarter etsy had nearly  million active buyers up about  both of these metrics demonstrate that our community of buyers and sellers continue to grow at a healthy rate roughly  of our visits come to us from a mobile device this quarter this was up approximately  basis points and continues to outpace the rate of growth on desktop mobile gms represented approximately  of our overall gms up roughly  basis points and accounted for more than  of our overall gms for the first time during the first quarter conversation rates on desktop mobile web and mobile app increased for the sixth consecutive quarter and our aggregate conversion rate across all devices also increased mobile conversion rate improvements allowed us to slightly narrow the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms with that said because the mobile web business makes up a large portion of our overall visits they are still a bit of the headwind for us this is because mobile web is the lowest converting device since the beginning of  we made a series of product improvements and enhanced the buyers journey we have seen an improvement in our aggregate conversion rate mobile web conversion improved at a greater rate in desktop and mobile apps during  for your reference mobile web converts at about half of desktop and mobile app converts at about x desktop as we continue to make enhancements to the mobile experience we expect to continue our progress in narrowing the mobile gap etsys international revenue grew  in first quarter percent international gms was  up a  basis points compared to last year international gms grew approximately  and accelerated yearoveryear for the fourth consecutive quarter during the first quarter total revenue was  million up  driven by growth in seller services and to a lesser extent growth in markets revenue seller services revenue was up  and represented  of total revenue seller services growth was driven primarily by revenue growth in etsys payments formally direct checkout our promoted listings revenue was lower than anticipated this quarter were refining our algorithms and have recently added additional inventory we believe both of these enhancements will allow us to continue to drive revenue growth in this seller service markets revenue grew  primarily due to growth in transaction fee and to a lesser extent growth in listing fee revenue gross profit for the first quarter was  million up  and gross margin was  down  basis points during the first quarter we recognized  million related to our google shopping tool for sellers however this revenue is not expected to be significant through the remainder of  last years gross margin was positively impacted by gift cards revenue of  million excluding these high margin revenue items gross margin would have only decreased marginally compared to last year turning now to operating expenses etsys first quarter operating expenses was  million up about  total operating expenses as a percent of revenue grew to about  in the first quarter compared with approximately  last year and  in the last quarter the increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue is primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses and marketing expenses associated with our brand campaign marketing expenses totaled  million up  representing  of total revenue versus  last year and roughly  last quarter the increase in marketing expense as a percent of revenue was driven by brand marketing expenses and to a lesser extent digital acquisition marketing and higher employee related expenses digital acquisition marketing expense which excludes brand marketing related spend on digital channels such as youtube and facebook increased  yearoveryear and continued to generate strong returns for etsy and a positive roi based on our global attribution model product development expenses totaled  million up  representing nearly  of total revenue compared to  last year the increase in product development expenses was driven by higher employee related expenses including additional expenses resulting from the acquisition of blackbird technology ga expenses totaled  million up about  driven by higher employee related expenses and partially offset by lower professional services expenses and stock compensation expenses related to the acquisition of alm ga expense represented  of revenue in the first quarter and remained flat compared to last year ga as a percent of revenue has decreased each year since  when it was nearly  of revenue to  in  headcount at the end of the quarter grew to  people compared with  as of december   during the first quarter etsys net loss was  and earnings per share were breakeven compared with earnings per share of  last year etsys net loss this year includes interest expense of  million related to our brooklyn headquarters a  million foreign exchange gain and an income tax benefit of  million all primarily noncash nongaap adjusted ebitda was  million this resulted in an adjusted ebitda margin of  compared with  in the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda this quarter was impacted by higher employee related expense and the increase in marketing as a percent of revenue during the quarter we recorded net cash divided by operating activities of  million this compares to  million in the first quarter of  the yearoveryear increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was mainly due to revenue growth as of march   we had cash marketable securities and shortterm investments totaling approximately  million as we noted in our press release our new management team will be reviewing our guidance josh i and the rest of the team will be rolling up our fleets and reviewing our forecast and we plan to provide guidance in conjunction with the announcement of our second quarter  results thanks for tuning in today we look forward to sharing more in the coming quarter and with that id like to turn the call back over to valarie to open up for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from heath terry of goldman sachs your line is open heath terry i was wondering you talked a lot about your goals around improving user engagement and frequency can you give us a sense as you progress through the quarter and even now that were a month further into these initiatives can you give us a sense of what youre seeing in terms of the strategies and methodologies youre putting in place that what kind of impact they are having on engagement or you getting any other traction that you want out of these investments chad dickerson thank heath i will take that one what weve really been focused on is continuing to improve on conversion and that really means focusing on the experience on all of our platform desktop mobile web mobile app as i said weve been improving conversion now for  to  quarters and we’re really excited about that work because its really demonstrates the overall success of the product work that were doing josh silverman and i think the team has been focusing exactly the right area this is josh great to meet you all and i think the acquisition of blackbird technologies is a great example of really driving a lot more conversion what youll hear from me as a term i call the aaa which is acquisition and activation and activity acquisition is the efforts to bring more people more visits to the site activation is conversion of those visits to buyers and activity is driving more royalties so buyers to come back again and again and i think there is good work underway in each of those buckets today and ill be laser focused with my team on each of those and thats driving the most value we can and i see a lot of opportunity for continued improvement in each of those three buckets heath terry great thanks chad josh i guess there is one other question on the efforts to build up local seller communities you guys have talked a lot in the past about the early attraction that you were seeing in the uk and some of the other markets any sort of tangible direction that you can give us on sort of either of foreign seller count or intercountry international gms that that would give us a sense of what kind of attraction you are seeing in those efforts karen mullane we are continuing to gain attraction in our international strategy the international gms that buyer and selling are in the same country outside of the united states is still the fastest growing bucket of gms for us operator thank you our next question comes from mark kelley of citigroup your line is open mark kelley can you just talk a little bit more about march what you saw there and what do you think the difference was relative to the beginning of the quarter you noticed the brand campaign was shown you some results just curious how much of that  million you spend in the quarter and if that had an impact do you think and then your buyer and seller bases continue to growing nicely but given that the lag in gms this quarter just curious if there is a mix shift in the kind of items your sellers are listing the lower price items thank you chad dickerson what we saw in march i think was pretty consistent what weve heard from whats happening in the macro environment i think we heard a lot of companies had a challenging february so we see march as really largely due to all the product development that weve done and continue to work on conversion and we are really excited about the progress in march karen mullane i would just add mark from februarys perspective were still unpacking how much were macro drivers as chad mentioned in this prepared comment and we key drivers for our model apdvs visits to conversion were all below what we expected and i think its a little bit  some data and weve talked about from our brand marketing campaign but its a little too early to comment on any impact that might be having in buyer and seller growth mark kelley got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from scott devitt of stifel your line is open scott devitt i was just wondering if you can talk a bit about just the longerterm direction of the company that business started to slow and grow and youve embarked on a campaign to address it to drive new buyers and get more purchasers from the existing buyers and you just sort of embarked on that progress and now you are making a management so i was just wondering if chad you or josh could just talk about whether there are views within the company in terms of may be the direction that you’ve taken isn’t the right one and if when guidance is updated three months from now if we may hear of modifications in strategy as well thank you chad dickerson sure chad speaking ill hand it off to josh in a moment i think that everyone at etsy the board the company is really excited about the longterm growth of etsy as i said even as i step aside i really believe in the longterm growth potential of etsy so there is no difference of opinion in that way i think josh is the leader as i said in my remarks i think josh brings a lot of skills to etsy that are very helpful at this stage in our growth and im really excited about that josh silverman thanks chad and just to build on that etsy has done something that’s really rare and really hard to do and that’s to build the twosided market place that really unique we have a very loyal and passionate group of sellers that offer a really unique set of inventory that’s not available anywhere else and that’s very special and very rare that driven a good amount of organic and direct traffic that comes to etsycom people actually wake up in the morning typing wwwetsycom not a lot of ecommerce site have that where weve not invested as much historically is in really pouring fuel on the fire with the more traditional marketing levers for the first eight years of the company it did no marketing and its pretty common for a market place that is successful that does earn organic traffic to be able to significantly accelerate its growth through the addition of marketing so when we as a board looked at whats going to unlock growth going forward in the future we looked at acquisition activity and loyalty and said that those are going to be very important leverage going forward and so having leadership that has a lot of experience in that area would be appropriate operator thank you our next question comes from andrew bruckner of rbc your line is open andrew bruckner two if i could im wondering if the change to etsy payments do you anticipate any increase in churn on the seller side from that and how can that effect increase ph going forward and then effectively now that we’ve passed the anniversary of pattern im wondering if you could make a comment in terms of how that has grown the gms from those specific sellers who are early adopters of pattern thanks chad dickerson i can speak to etsy payments so etsy payments which we first started rolling out almost five years ago has become a platform to our sellers really love to use and as i said in my remarks weve also found that sellers who use etsy payments formally direct checkout are generally more successful than the one who don’t so i think etsy payments as we begin to require for sellers we believe well make sellers successful so really happy with that karen mullane and andrew with regards to pattern in our last call we give you an update about usage and we said roughly  of our active sellers in  had used in the eight months since its launch so i wouldn’t consider it a material driver of our gms at this point in time operator thank you our next question comes from indiscernible your line is open unidentified analyst just one question please josh youve been a board observer now a ceo there has been a lot of rumors in the market and i think could you make that academic argument for etsy as part of a larger organization but from your standpoint from where you sit right now can you just talk about how and why you think that etsy can drive more value operating independently versus part of a larger organizations thanks a lot josh silverman sure as a board we are laser focused on delivering value for our shareholders and i feel like there is a tremendous market opportunity for etsy that it has only began to tap and a very bright future so im working hard with the team here to make sure that were entirely focused on the activities thats going to deliver the most value for all of our stakeholders our sellers our buyers our shareholders and our employees and im very enthusiastic about the path forward operator thank you our next question comes from tom forte of maxim group your line is open tom forte so going back to february is there something as you point to either from a competitive standpoint or geographic standpoint to the extent that maybe there is incremental pressure in europe for something like that or from our calendar standpoint to the extent of valentines day this year maybe have been materially weaker than last year just any comments on anything in february on those basis that maybe have affected the results thank you chad dickerson so jennifer you can speak again in terms of the metrics that we did see as we said lower acvv and as i mentioned the office saw some macro issues that weve seen elsewhere in the economy for example you all probably heard that q consumer spending growth was lower than it has been since the fourth quarter of  as reported by the us government so those are the things that we saw in february jennifer beugelmans yes tom i think as i mentioned previously were still analyzing it but there was just a confluence of external factors that may have had an impact everything from mechanisms ph of thing that macro political landscape to tax refunds coming out later than anticipated but what we did disclose in our prepared remarks is that we did see recovery in march operator thank you our next question comes from darren aftahi of roth your line is open darren aftahi can you just talk a little bit more about where the areas specifically where the headcount reduction will occur and then just on followingup on the etsy payments transition do you anticipate or are you at all concerned about potential push back from seller as it pertains to be given the may th deadlines for adoption thanks chad dickerson sure so on the headcount reduction we exercise a really simple philosophy we wanted to as much as possible ship cost out of ga in the growth oriented areas so we really looked out at in those terms and again that was on the heels of that realigning our teams and the reorganizing our teams to promote more clarity and accountability and speed in the works that they were doing so we think that this is a right decision for etsy in the longterm and i think it focuses the company much much more on the etsy payment side again what we found is that sellers who use etsy payments again formally direct checkout are more successful than the sellers who are not and since we’re so focused on sellers success we believe that more and more sellers will continue to use etsy payments and that we will be beneficial for individual sellers and the business overall operator thank you our next question comes from blake harper of loop capital your line is open blake harper i want to ask two questions one are you able to quantify with the dollar cost savings is of the headcounts reductions that you’re doing and then secondly is there any update to the sellers services pipeline or josh could you comment what you think about as you look at the product pipeline or how  in other ways you can help your sellers by delivering some new product to them karen mullane hey blake what we can tell you about the reduction is that its mostly focused in headcount as we mentioned in our disclosures  headcount positions roughly  of our work force well provide additional detail when we update our guidance on our second quarter call josh silverman and so solid services chad and team have been very focused on that and have done a great job of unlocking value we have a pipeline im very excited about of continues ways to help sellers to promote and sells their things on etsy and in other channels as well operator thank you and our last question comes from sam kemp from piper jaffray your line is open sam kemp sorry if you already answer these im between calls but josh can you line your thoughts on what you think the appropriate level of marketing investment is for etsy it seems in general overall its always been in little bit underinvestment in the marketing side and then secondly can you talk about how you philosophically thinking about third party channels and the level of control you want to exert over where the actual product is placed for example instagram is making a lot of progress towards making it more of a shopping direct channels and i was just wondering if thats a channel that youre especially infested in participating in thanks josh silverman to the first question and i apologize for others i didn’t say this earlier but i think its worth noting etsy did not do any marketing for the first eight years of its history and traditionally when you have a market place vibrant enough and good enough to earn a direct traffic as the etsy market place does with the breath and depth of really terrific inventory from great sellers like etsy that’s something you want to talk about and there is lot of very effective marketing leverage that one can pull and i think that quite candidly we have done some good work in the last few years to start to build those capabilities but im very enthusiastic about the continued upside that we have to invest further marketing dollars and in infrastructure and capabilities to put those marketing dollars to work at very high roi so i do think that all three areas of the marketing funnel from acquisition to activation to activity have up side and its going to be a strong focus im sorry the second part of your question can you  how do i feel about our seller inventories being available not just on etsy but off etsy is that what you were saying sam kemp yes and especially transaction occur off the etsy platform but are populated by the etsy inventory from etsy sellers or maybe even just more broadly speaking how do you think about prioritizing the etsy direct marketplace versus not etsy marketplaces josh silverman yes good question first i would say that our goal is to make sure that our sellers succeed that they come they have a great experience on etsy and then they can grow and scale their business and support their familys ad thrive and we think thats a very important mission we also think that the mission of delivering an outstanding buyer experience on etsy is very important to us and etsycom our core marketplace and

bring joy to the craft supplies marketplace comment share tweet stumble email etsy wants to bring “joy” to the process of shopping for craft supplies with its new online marketplace etsy studiothe company is stepping into the  billion craft supply industry with the new website launching in april it will be dedicated to selling craft supplies to both experts and amateurs offering around eight million products for sale — from beads and handdyed fabric to weaving looms“when we look at the craft supplies marketplace we really believe that anyone can make and we just need to bring out the joy of making” etsy ceo chad dickerson told “cbs this morning” thursday “so when we designed etsy studio we really baked joy into it” play video saturday etsy sellers pitch to major retail stores etsy is an online marketplace where entrepreneurs can sell anything to anyone close to two milion makers and sellers already swear by the websit etsy studio hopes to distinguish itself from competitors like michaels and joann by making shopping for craft supplies easier online the site will also offer easytofollow project tutorials to help “anyone to do a short weekend project or even something longer” dickerson said dickerson himself said he’s currently learning how to quilt from a tutorialsince its launch in  etsy has had tremendous success growing to more than  million buyers and  sellers around the world “what made you believe this could work as a website” asked cbs news’ anthony mason“what we really saw in  was that this community that you see when you see offline craft heirs you see people buying and selling from each other spending time with each other admiring each other’s crafts – that you can bring that experience online and that local feel of standing across the table from someone you could replicate online and connect people from across the world” dickerson said like its parent company etsy studio will also reach globally“the great thing about buying in etsy studio is that you’ll be buying from a small business somewhere around the world so you’ll be supporting an individual” dickerson said “and our seller base is largely women — about  percent are women”dickerson said etsy studio will also only allow the selling and buying of original merchandise“how do you rebut some of the criticism that with etsy selling these mass manufactured products that that will take sort of this homespun image away from etsy” cohost norah o’donnell asked“yeah so we don’t allow mass manufactured products on etsy we do allow people to use third parties to do things like jewelry casting which is a very expensive difficult even dangerous part of jewelry making so everything on etsy has to be created by the creators themselves” dickerson said for those who ponder the meaning of the company’s unique name dickerson said it can “really means whatever you want it to be” “we have a tradition in the company when anyone asks we make up a different answer” dickerson said “so the best answer that we have is there’s a section of fellini’s film ‘ ’ where one of the characters says ‘etsi’ and it sounded really good and that’s where etsy came from”     cbs interactive inc all rights
