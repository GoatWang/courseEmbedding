chose bounty minerals because we have a simple business plan buy minerals – manage minerals contact us about bounty minerals bounty minerals buys oil and gas mineral interests in appalachia in april of  jon brumley created bounty minerals llc a minerals acquisition partnership headquartered in fort worth texas the partnership acquires minerals exclusively in appalachia to date bounty minerals has purchased over  net mineral acres in west virginia pennsylvania and ohio our approach is simple we use economic models to calculate fair values for both buyer and seller people choose to sell to

outcome of wells in your area if you sell bounty a portion of your minerals you may want bounty to manage your remaining interest  bounty minerals management can help you administer the portion of the minerals you retain  therefore you have the opportunity to receive immediate cash by selling a portion of your minerals while retaining an interest to participate in future revenues why bounty

people  great reputation experienced team that has worked together for over  years jon brumley president and ceo michael mazur executive vice president and chief operating officer heather donaldson vice president of accounting tracie palmer vice president of land valerie antonette vice president bounty minerals management selling mineral acreage is a big decision it was important to us to work with a purchasing company that has a smooth well defined process that pays on time and at the agreed upon per acre price we were very pleased to work with bounty minerals in both ohio and pennsylvania when selling our mineral acreage bounty paid on time and was very flexible in working with our  exchange agency we also felt that bounty was very competitive with their price per acre offer right from the start thank you for making it a great experience for us fred and lisa vandenheuvel exportpaamerican mineral solutions thoroughly enjoys its working relationship with bounty minerals and bounty minerals management bounty offers consistency in the ever changing environment of oil and gas everything from start to finish is done right on time the first time if situations arise throughout the acquisition process everyone at bounty is pleased to help work with ams and the landowner to make sure everyone’s expectations are met we are grateful for the opportunity to work with bounty dan spitznagel president american mineral solutions why have bounty manage your minerals providing mineral monitoring services to royalty owners from a land and revenue perspective and protecting future revenue land leasing services revenue and royalty check monitoring services valuation of oil and gas oil and gas revenue checks are often paid incorrectly and these discrepancies in some instances equate to large amounts of revenue bounty minerals management is capable of reviewing processing and independently analyzing these revenue statements why bounty minerals management at the beginning of  mr brumley founded bounty minerals management a new company to benefit mineral owners in the appalachian basin  correctly managing minerals is time consuming and at times difficult  most oil and gas operators are fair and honest however a few are not evenhanded and even the best can make mistakes  that is why it is important for mineral owners to be vigilant in lease negotiations and monitoring potentially excessive deductions from royalty payments if bounty minerals purchases a portion of your minerals you will have the option of agreeing to let bounty minerals management manage the minerals you retain  such management services can include lease negotiation review and analysis of division orders and review of royalty checks if bounty minerals owns an interest in the same well or unit as your minerals bounty’s revenue accountants will already be studying the related division orders and deductions  we will be looking to see if checks are issued in the proper amount and if too little royalty has been paid to the royalty owners  if the payments are not correct bounty can contact the operator on behalf of both you and bounty  often the amount of such discrepancies would be too small to warrant a lawsuit however bounty’s relationships and networking with operators can be extremely valuable in resolving these issues  this is our business and you can receive the same attention as bounty if oil and gas interests constitute a substantial portion of your estate heirs may be left to sift through the chaos and mountains of paperwork it may even require experts with the ability to supervise future production by allowing bounty minerals management to purchase a portion of your assets while managing the remainder on your behalf we can protect your oil and gas interests and royalty income for future generations by providing continuity during the transfer to the next generation the fee for bounty minerals management services is small—just  of the gross royalty that you receive jon brumley the founder of bounty minerals management has  years of experience in the oil and gas industry including the formation of  oil and gas companies that were listed on the new york stock exchange in  forbes magazine named mr brumley and his son jonny brumley entrepreneurs of the year bounty minerals has negotiated leases and has established relationships with the leading
