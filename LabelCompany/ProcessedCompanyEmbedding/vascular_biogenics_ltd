program is based on its vascular targeting system vts platform technology which utilizes genetically targeted therapy to destroy newly formed or angiogenic blood vessels its lead product candidate vbofranergene obadenovec is a genebased biologic that it is developing for solid tumor indications with a program for recurrent glioblastoma rgbm a form of brain cancer it also is engaged in conducting a program focusing antiinflammatory diseases based on the use of its lecinoxoid platform technology lecinoxoids are a class of small molecules it developed that are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules known to modulate inflammation the lead product candidate from this program vb is a phase iiready molecule that demonstrated efficacy in reducing vascular inflammation in a phase ii substudy in psoriatic patients with cardiovascular riskvts platformthe companys vts platform technology enables systemic administration of gene therapy to either destroy or promote angiogenic blood vessels vts is both tissue and conditionspecific allowing for targeted and limited gene expression in endothelial cells the thin layer of cells that lines the interior surface of blood vessels undergoing angiogenesis its vts platform technology comprises three components a viral vector a promoter and a transgene the viral vector is a modified virus that is used as a delivery vehicle to distribute the promoter and the transgene throughout the body the promoter is its genetically modified promoter ppex which specifically targets the endothelial cells of angiogenic blood vessels the transgene is a genetic sequence designed to yield a specific biologic effect the expression of which is directed by ppexthe company has studied vb in a phase i all comers trial involving patients with multiple types of metastatic cancer types including thyroid cancer neuroendocrine cancer renal cell carcinoma and lung cancer in that trial vb was tolerated and showed a dose dependent extension in median overall survival across a range of tumor types its vts platform technology enables systemic administration of gene therapy to either destroy or promote angiogenic blood vessels it has also generated additional product candidates which utilize the same vector and promoter as in vb and comprise alternative functional transgenes which include vb an antiangiogenic candidate vb and vb which are proangiogenic candidates that may be employed for ischemic conditions such as peripheral vascular diseaselecinoxoid platformthe companys lecinoxoid platform technology comprises a family of orally administered small molecules designed to modulate the bodys inflammatory response lecinoxoids are compounds that are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules known as oxidized phospholipids which possess immune modulating antiinflammatory properties modified to manage stability and activity its lead lecinoxoidbased compound vb is designed as an oral agent for the control of chronic inflammatory disorders vb inhibits the cdtlr and tlr pathways as well as monocyte migration the company has also developed second and third

therapy vb is a unique biologic agent that uses a dual mechanism to target solid tumors based on a nonintegrating nonreplicating adeno  vector it utilizes vbl’s proprietary vascular targeting system vts™ to target the tumor vasculature for cancer therapy unlike antivegf or tkis vb does not aim to block a specific proangiogenic pathway instead it uses an angiogenesisspecific sensor vbl’s ppex proprietary promoter to specifically induce cell death in angiogenic endothelial cells in the tumor milieu this mechanism retains activity regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the proangiogenic factors secreted by the tumor and shows activity even after failure of prior treatment with other antiangiogenics moreover vb induces specific antitumor immune response which is accompanied by recruitment of cd tcells and apoptosis of tumor cells vbl has obtained fast track designation for vb in the united states for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following a treatment with standard chemotherapy and radiation we have also received orphan drug designation in both the united states and europe vb successfully demonstrated proofofconcept and survival benefit in phase  clinical trials in rgbm thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer preclinical insights preclinical pharmacological and toxicology studies on vb have shown tissue specificity for the tumor tissue no significant damage to normal noncancerous tissues or to the normal blood vessels in the body and a more than  percent reduction in metastatic lung cancer model with one injection as well as similar efficacy in other tumor models phase i “all comers” clinical trial we conducted our phase  “all comers” clinical trial of vb in the united states as an openlabel doseescalating trial to assess the safety pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vb in  patients with advanced metastatic cancer the trial was performed at multiple centers and was initiated as a single dose trial a statistically significant improved overall survival in the vb therapeutic dose cohort as compared to other cohorts was seen in addition there was a trend of improvement in the progression free survival rate in response to vb at the therapeutic dose  following prolonged stability a partial response or both in several patients after treatment with a single dose we enrolled patients into two additional dose cohorts who received multiple therapeutic doses of vb in two specific tumor types a manuscript detailing our phase  study can be found

the month overall survival was  in the vb continuous exposure cohort compared with only  in historical pooled avastin trials p at asco  vbl presented additional analyses from the phase  study which demonstrate that tumor growth kinetics was significantly attenuated upon longer treatment with vb ovarian cancer in addition at the  asco meeting vbl reported results from a phase  trial of vb in patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer  the data demonstrate a median overall survival of  days in the vb therapeutic dose arm versus  days in the low dose arm a result that was statistically significant there was also a durable doubling in the response rate as measured by a reduction in the ca biomarker compared to historical rates of avastin® bevacizumab plus chemotherapy

of vb at least once while  patients did not feverish patients demonstrated increased overall survival of  months compared to nonfeverish patients who had a median overall survival of  months p this correlation between clinical efficacy and fever suggests that vb may induce an immune response in patients and supports a role of the immune system as part of vb’s mechanism of action these findings strengthen vb preclinical data which showed an elevated immune response in tumors of vbtreated animals on june  at the  american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting vbl reported new data

advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries our potential competitors may succeed in developing acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop or achieve earlier patent protection regulatory approval product commercialization and market penetration than us additionally technologies developed by others may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors in particular vb may face competition from currently approved drugs and drug candidates under development by others to treat rgbm in may  the fda granted accelerated approval to avastin bevacizumab which is an angiogenesis inhibitor to treat patients with rgbm at progression after standard firstline therapy in addition to bevacizumab a number of companies are conducting latestage clinical trials to test targeted drugs focused on angiogenesis inhibition for the treatment of ovarian cancer including among others amgen’s trebananib boehringer ingelheim’s nintedanib and glaxosmithkline’s votrient even if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate faster than our competitors we may face competition from biosimilars in the united states the biologics price competition and innovation act of  created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “highly similar” or biosimilar to or “interchangeable” with an fdaapproved biological product this pathway could allow competitors to reference data from biological products already approved after  years from the time of approval in europe the european commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years in europe a competitor may reference data from biological products already approved but will not be able to market a biosimilar until ten years after the time of approval this year period will be extended to  years if during the first eight of those  years the marketing authorization holder obtains an approval for one or more new therapeutic indications that bring significant clinical benefits compared with existing therapies in addition companies may be developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with our products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our products our products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences expiration or successful challenge of our applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired in addition although vb has been granted orphan drug status by the fda and ema for a specified indication there are limitations to the exclusivity in the united states the exclusivity period for orphan drugs is seven years while pediatric exclusivity adds six months to any existing patents or exclusivity periods in europe orphan drugs may be able to obtain  years of marketing exclusivity and up to an additional two years on the basis of qualifying pediatric studies however orphan exclusivity may be reduced to six years if the drug no longer satisfies the original designation criteria additionally a marketing authorization holder may lose its orphan exclusivity if it consents to a second orphan drug application or cannot supply enough drug orphan drug exclusivity also can be lost when a second applicant demonstrates its drug is “clinically superior” to the original orphan drug finally as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent rights we could face more litigation with respect to the validity or scope of patents relating to other parties’ products the availability of other parties’ products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for any products that we may develop and commercialize since some of our product candidates are aimed for rare diseases loss of exclusivity or competition as described above may be very significant in light of the limited size of the relevant market company description we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery development and commercialization of firstinclass treatments for cancer and immune inflammatory diseases our clinical pipeline is based on two distinct proprietary platform technologies that leverage the body’s natural physiologic and genetic regulatory elements to date we have developed two programs based on these platforms—an oncology program and an antiinflammatory program our lead product candidate from our oncology program vb is a genebased biologic that we are initially developing for recurrent glioblastoma or rgbm an aggressive form of brain cancer we have obtained fast track designation for vb in the united states for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following treatment with standard chemotherapy and radiation we have also received orphan drug designation in both the united states and europe the fda has concurred with the design and planned analyses of our phase  pivotal trial of vb in rgbm pursuant to a special protocol assessment or spa we intend to begin this trial in the first half of  subject to the fda being satisfied with the potency release assay to be used in the trial our lead product candidate from our antiinflammatory program vb is an oral small molecule we are currently evaluating in phase  clinical trials for psoriasis and for ulcerative colitis we have completed enrollment of both of these phase  clinical trials and we expect topline results from these trials in the first quarter of  our oncology program is based on our proprietary vascular targeting system or vts platform technology which utilizes genetically targeted therapy to destroy newly formed or angiogenic blood vessels we believe this technology will allow us to develop product candidates for multiple oncology indications our antiinflammatory program is based on the use of our lecinoxoid platform technology lecinoxoids are a novel class of small molecules we developed that are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules known to modulate inflammation we believe our two distinct platform technologies provide us with an opportunity to develop a diversified portfolio of product candidates targeting both orphan indications and large markets  the legal
