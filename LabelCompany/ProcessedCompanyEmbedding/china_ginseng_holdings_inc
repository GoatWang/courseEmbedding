the year ended june   the analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable securities and exchange commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events company overview our company china ginseng holdings inc was incorporated on june   in the state of nevada since our inception in  we have been engaged in the business of farming processing distribution and marketing of fresh ginseng dry ginseng ginseng seeds and seedlings starting in august  we have gradually shifted the focus of our business from direct sales of ginseng to canned ginseng juice production and wine production our current focus is the sales of canned ginseng juice after we shifted the focus of our business into the ginseng beverage business we have started to store our raw material and sell only a limited amount of our selfproduced ginseng we also purchase ginseng from outside sources and then resell it to generate revenue which sales are based on orders from the market however due to the global recession and local market conditions demand for ginseng exports declined beginning in  creating a significant oversupply in china all those factors caused us to incur losses in  and  additionally in june  we decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes due to the poor quality of recent harvests which were not suitable for the production of wine or grape juice we did not renew the leases for grape vineyard with the chinese government when the leases expired on december   on june   we discontinued our grape production operations and sold the assets and liabilities of tonghua linyuan going forward we plan to purchase grapes from market to produce wine if we receive orders from customers due to limited capital at this moment our current main focus is ginseng beverage business however we plan to further adjust our business strategy when our financial situation improves in addition as our new business is in the initial stages we need to spend capital to promote our new products and develop our marketing plan there is no assurance that there will be sufficient demand for our beverages to allow us to operate profitably initially or at all we have recurring operating losses and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of march   and december   the cash balance on hand for the company was  and  respectively in order to meet the challenge we raised capital to support our operation through credit letter loan info in addition we established hong kong huaxia in hong kong as a sales company for health products and specialized local goods in march  hong kong huaxia was set up as a part of our adjusted marketing strategy so that we can explore the asia market through hong kong huaxia while jilin huamei remains focused on domestic sales in china the focus of hong kong huaxia is the sale of our ginseng juice in the asia market hong kong huaxia is currently recruiting distributors for the asia market in addition to its online shopping platform for direct sales of our ginseng juice and as a part of our market promoting we plan to open online store through taobao the biggest online businesstoconsumer and consumertoconsumer platform in asia because taobao only accepts business with domestic business address we established a new wholly owned subsidiary of hong kong huaxia jilin huaxia ginseng co ltd jilin huaxia which is located in china in the quarter ended december   jilin huaxia borrowed  rmb  in order to fund the acquisition of machinery and equipment subsequent to march   we returned machinery and equipment with a cost of  and a carrying value of  to the original seller the lender of the loan dated october   with a carrying value of  at march   agreed to defer repayment until we receives the amounts due from the return of the machinery and equipment although we have generated only limited revenues from our ginseng beverage business since we shifted the focus of our businesses we believe there is future potential to do so because i the china ginseng market is recovering now ii the demand and the price is in an uptrend due to chinese government restrictions on the amount of land available for ginseng farming land under our companys control has not been affected by the government restrictions as the impact of the shift in the focus of our business away from the ginseng business and into the ginseng beverage business and the wine business is uncertain and the shift represents a material change in our business our past revenues and other financial results do not provide a meaningful basis for future performance and there is no guarantee that we will be able to attain profitability in the foreseeable future our subsidiaries our business in china is currently mainly conducted through our whollyowned subsidiaries yanbian huaxia jilin ganzhi jilin huamei jilin huaxia which are located in north china and hong kong huaxia which is located in hong kong · yanbian huaxing ginseng industry co ltd yanbian huaxing is a wholly foreign owned enterprise wfoewith a registered capital of  yanbian huaxing is operated to plant ginseng and our revenue in the past was mainly from the sales of ginseng produced and sold by yanbian huaxing · jilin ganzhi ginseng products co ltd jilin ganzhi is a wfoe with a registered capital of  it is operated to process ginseng and produce canned ginseng juice · jilin huamei beverage co ltd jilin huamei is a wfoe with a registered capital of  it is operated to market our canned ginseng juice · hong kong huaxia international industrial co ltd hong kong huaxia is our whollyowned subsidiary with a registered capital of hkd  approximately  which has not been funded by us it is operated to sell health products and specialized local goods · jinlin huaxia ginseng co ltd jilin huaxia is a whollyowned subsidiary of hong kong huaxia with a registered capital of  jilin huaxia was incorporated in september  as a part of our market promoting strategy we plan to open online stroe through taobao the biggest online businessto consumer and consumertoconsumer plaftform in asia because taobao only accepts stores with domestic business address we established jilin huaxia to facilitate our expansion to bc and cc markets our products through yanbian huaxing we obtained year leases to  acres of land approved by the local government for ginseng growing on june   and we have developed  of the land resources since august  we have gradually shifted our business focus from direct sales of ginseng and ginseng byproducts to the production and sale of canned ginseng juice we have started reserving most of the ginseng produced by yanbian huaxing for use in the planned production of canned ginseng juice meanwhile as there is a higher standard for ginseng used in canned ginseng juice we are able to sell some of the ginseng produced by yanbian huaxing which is not qualified for use in canned ginseng juice to the market through yanbian huaxing although we have shifted our business focus to the production and sale of ginseng juice we still receive orders for ginseng and its byproducts because of our reputation in the industry for selling highquality ginseng we intend to maintain this part of our business even though it is no longer our business focus in addition if we receive large orders for ginseng andor ginseng byproducts we will directly purchase ginseng andor ginseng byproducts from the market if we can get a lower price of the products this part of sale of ginseng is generated on an ordertoorder basis and conditioned on whether we can get a lower price for such demanded products in the market through jilin ganzhi we produce two types of canned ginseng juice · ganzhi asian ginseng beverage · ganzhi american ginseng beverage canned ginseng juice to produce canned ginseng juice we take ginseng juice extracted from fresh ginseng as the main material and add natural extracts like xylitol citric acid and steviosides as subsidiary ingredients we have farming technicians periodically inspect farmers to ensure they follow our growing guidelines to control the quality of the fresh ginseng and when we need to purchase fresh ginseng from the market for production of ginseng juice we limit our choice to the highest quality of fresh ginseng we use low residue pesticide and biodegradable fertilizer for ginseng planting we use xylitol instead of sugar to lower calories which also does not cause products to have a sour taste the most important component of ginseng is ginsenoside based upon reading our competitors product labels all of their ginseng drinks are blended after extracting ginsenosides through chemical methods the chemical extraction of ginsenosides will cause damage to its nutritional components our technology is different from the traditional method used by our competitors we squeezeout the natural juice from fresh ginseng so as to preserve freshness and nutrition in the final product squeezing is not commonly used in canned ginseng juice because it requires fresh ginseng the preservation of which is very difficult fresh ginseng rots very fast the harvest time concentrates in september and october which is a fairly short period after that one can only buy dried ginseng from the market such as sundried ginseng from which we cannot squeeze juice however our drink formula uses refrigerated ginseng as a raw material to produce canned ginseng juice which enables us to maintain its freshness and nutrition in our final products the drink formula for our ginseng beverages is a registered patent approved by the chinese government patent number zl  this patent was issued on january   and expires  years after issuance this is the reason we store our fresh ginseng in refrigerated warehouse space we are currently renting a refrigerated warehouse  degrees celsius to store all fresh ginseng inventory necessary for production of the ginseng beverages monthly rent for refrigerated warehouse is rmb  about  this lease is currently expired and operating on a month to month basis we commenced production in august  and sales in october  which was reflected in our financial statement for the three months ending december   we initiated our sales of canned ginseng juice in china and we plan to expand our business to overseas markets in  or  our ganzhi ginseng beverage costs approximately  per  ml bottle and our american ginseng beverage costs approximately  per  ml bottle however as we are in the initial stage of the ginseng beverage business we cannot assure the demands for our ginseng beverage will be profitable in the short term and there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate the revenue from ginseng beverage business we own the production plant for ginseng juice the plant is certified by the chinese government as a good manufacturing process facility which is required for our production of these products good manufacturing process standards cover organization and personnel building and facilities equipment materials hygiene and sanitation validation documentation production management quality management production distribution and recall complaints and adverse reactions report and selfinspections distribution we intend to recruit one general distributor for our products of ginseng beverage in every city in china through jilin huamei the city level distributor can recruit the second level distributors in addition to recruiting general distributors in some major cities jilin huamei will establish sale branch offices to facilitate the local sales our direct sales will target customers of highend retailers such as supermarkets pharmacies hotels gift shops entertainment centers tourists attractions airport and highspeed trains etc we are using the same distribution agreement for our general distributors although specific terms might differ based upon negotiations we have with each distributor in specific regard to our ginseng juice business we have signed five  distributors through jilin huamei as of the date of this filing as for the distribution of our wine we have signed one  distributor through jilin huamei as of the date of this filing in addition as a part of our adjustment to our marketing strategy for our ginseng juice we established hong kong huaxia in march  hong kong huaxia recruits distributors to sell ginseng juice outside of china in asia markets and to build and maintain an online shopping platform through which to take orders directly from end user customers in addition we plan to open online shop via taobao the biggest online bc and cc platform in asia because taobao requires business to have a domestic address we set up jinlin huaxia a subsidiary of hong kong huaxia which is located in jinlin china competitive environment the market for ginseng products is highly competitive our operations may be affected by technological advances by competitors industry consolidation patents granted to competitors competitive combination products new products offered by our competitors as well as new information provided by other marketed products andor other postmarket studies critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including the allowance for doubtful accounts the saleability and recoverability of inventory income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in addition past financial results are not indicative of future performance due to our emphasis on further commercializing ginseng juice with our crops as raw materials and broadening our offering furthermore we cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations we assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary consolidated financial statements the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and activities of china ginseng holdings inc and its whollyowned subsidiaries yanbian huaxing ginseng co limited jilin huamei

costs are seeds labor applicable overhead including depreciation and supplies common costs are allocated in each period based upon the total number of hectors under cultivation during the period the carrying value of the ginseng crops is reviewed on a regular basis for any impairment in value using managements best estimate as to expect future market values yields and costs to harvest costs accumulated on the acres expected to be harvested during the next fiscal year have been classified as a current asset in march  the company determined that the grape juice inventory held at tonghua linyuan is no longer saleable as such the company wrote off inventory with a value of rmb   at june   at march   and june   there were no shipments of ginseng at customer locations awaiting inspection and approval that may be subject to invoicing revenue recognition the company processes ginseng and stores the stock for ginseng juice production any grown ginseng that is not suitable for the beverage production is sold the company also purchases ginseng from farmers for its resale business ginseng is planted in the spring march and fall september of each year and is generally harvested in september it usually takes  years for a ginseng root to mature although senior maturity can be as long as  years harvested ginseng can be sold in two ways  fresh ginseng which can be sold immediately and stored in refrigerators for up to  years and  dried ginseng which is processed and dried via sunlight and steam machines drying is a twomonth process dried ginseng can be stored up to  years the company has focused on selling dried ginseng as it is more profitable than selling fresh ginseng the company has also been storing fresh ginseng for future juice manufacturing when the company sells ginseng it receives orders prior to harvest for major customers approximately  to  is paid upon delivery as payment in advance the balance is billed after the customers inspection process is completed which can take up to  days until the customer finalizes its inspection and deems the shipment acceptable the shipment is still the property of the company upon customer completion of inspection and approval the sale is then recognized and the balance of the invoice price is wired to the company for smaller sales customers pick up the ginseng from the company pay in cash at time of pick up and receive an invoice with the appropriate sales tax applied and a cash acknowledgement on these orders revenue is recognized upon shipmentpayment the company has entered into several distribution agreements to sell ginseng juice in accordance with these agreements the distributors will advance funds to the company for orders to be placed upon the placement of orders by the distributor the company will ship the product to the distributor and title will pass to the distributor in relation to distribution agreements for ginseng beverages it is the companys policy commencing upon the execution of the distribution agreements to allow the distributors to return all unsold products at the end of six  months from the shipment date should the product not be sold and the product has not exceeded the expiration date the company is establishing history as to the quantity of the ginseng which has been returned in order to determine if a reserve for returns and allowances is necessary to date returns have been minimal for each reporting period the company ascertains from each distributor its current on hand quantity and assesses the situation in order to establish a return allowance if necessary as of march   and june   all distribution sales had been sold to third parties accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consists principally of trade receivables when ginseng is shipped to a customer the customer pays  of the invoice and is entitled to an inspection process which could take up to  days upon completion of the inspection and approval process the customer notifies the company and a sale is recorded the allowance for doubtful accounts represents managements estimate of the amount of probable credit losses determined by reviewing past due balances and other information account balances are written off against the allowance if management determines the receivable is uncollectible the companys standard terms stipulate payment in  days and consider a receivable to be uncollectible after one year the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at june   and june   respectively vineyard development costs in june  the company

juice going concern as indicated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company had an accumulated deficit of  as of march   and there are existing uncertain conditions the company foresees relating to its ability to obtain working capital and operate successfully managements plans include the raising of capital through the debt and equity markets to fund future operations and the generating of revenue through its businesses failure to raise adequate capital and generate adequate sales revenues could result in the company having to curtail or cease operations additionally even if the company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues there can be no assurances that the revenues will be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations these matters raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern however the

plan to open online store through taobao the biggest online businesstoconsumer and consumertocobnsumer platform in asia because taobao only accepts business with domestic business address we established a new wholly owned subsidiary of hong kong huaxia jilin huaxia ginseng co ltd jilin huaxia which is located in jilin china in the quarter ended december   jilin huaxia borrowed  rmb  in order to fund the acquisition of machinery and equipment although we have generated only limited revenues from our ginseng beverage and wine businesses since we shifted the focus of our businesses we believe there is future potential to do so because i the china ginseng market is recovering now ii the demand and the price is in an uptrend due to chinese government restrictions on the amount of land available for ginseng farming land under our companys control has not been affected by the government restrictions as the impact of the shift in the focus of our business away from the ginseng business and into the ginseng beverage business and the wine business is uncertain and the shift represents a material change in our business our past revenues and other financial results do not provide a meaningful basis for future performance and there is no guarantee that we will be able to attain profitability in the foreseeable future our subsidiaries our business in china is currently mainly conducted through our whollyowned subsidiaries  yanbian huaxia jilin ganzhi jilin huamei which are located in north china and hong kong huaxia which is located in hong kong  on june   the company discontinued its grape production operations the company sold the assets and liabilities of tonghua linyuan and plans to close tonghua linyuan below is the operational status of each of these businesses as of the date of this filing yanbian huaxing ginseng industry co ltd yanbian huaxing  ginseng farming and sales  on september   we and jilin dunhua huaxing ginseng industry co ltd jilin ganzhi ginseng products co ltd jilin ganzhi  produces canned ginseng juice  on august   we acquired  equity interest in jilin ganzhi at a price of  we received a certificate of approval issued by the competent local approval authority on may   and a business license issued by the competent local registration authority on june   subsequently on september   and august   we increased jilin ganzhis registered capital by  and  respectively now the registered capital of jilin ganzhi is  we applied with the relevant prc approval and registration authorities for each of the aforesaid capital increases and have obtained all applicable approvals and registrations for such changes including a renewed certificate of approval issued by the local approval authority and a renewed business license issued by the local registration authority certifying jilin ganzhi as a wfoe lawfully owned by us jilin ganzhi is operated to process ginseng and produce canned ginseng juice jilin ganzhi started production of canned ginseng juice in the three months ended december   tonghua linyuan grape planting co tonghua linyuan  grew grapes and produced wine through a winery producer until june   when tonghua linyuan became a shell company and ceased operations  on january   we acquired  equity interest in tonghua linyuan from two prc individual shareholders at a price of  the price was determined by armslength negotiations based upon the appraised net asset value of tonghua linyuan at the time of acquisition which was approximately  tonghua linyuan was operated to plant grapes and produce wine as of june  the planned production of wine and grape juice had not commenced due to the poor quality of the harvests from tonghua linyuan in recent years which were not suitable for the production of wine or grape juice therefore the company decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes on june   tonghua linyuan entered into a sale agreement with mr wenkai wang to transfer all assets and debts of tonghua linyuan to mr wenkai wang for  zero consideration including the ownership of machinery and equipment the right to the use of the plant and the debt of  million of tonghua linyuan effective immediately mr wang has been engaged in wine sale business in tonghua city for many years and does not have any material relationship with the company or any of its affiliates or any director or officer of the company or any associate of any such director or officer other than in respect of the sale of tonghua linyuan pursuant to the sale of all assets and debts tonghua linyuan became a shell with no operations we believe that it is in the best interest of the company to dispose of the assets and debts of tonghua linyuan going forward the company will purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine and grape juice contracts entered into by tonghua linyuan with a winery producer for production of wine remain valid and will be fulfilled by jilin huamei jilin huamei beverage co ltd jilin huamei  markets our canned ginseng juice and wine  we incorporated jilin huamei as a wfoe on october   we received a certificate of approval issued by the competent local approval authority on october   and a business license issued by the competent local registration authority on october   certifying jilin huamei as a wfoe lawfully owned by us the registered capital of jilin huamei is  jilin huamei operates as a sales department for our canned ginseng juice and wine which are produced by our other subsidiaries we plan to recruit one general distributor for our canned ginseng juice and one general distributor for our wine in each big city in china through jilin huamei we commenced sales of our ginseng beverage in october  and jilin huamei started generating revenue in november  as of the date of this filing jilin huamei has five  general distributors for our ginseng beverage and one  general distributor for our wine jilin huamei established one  sale branch office in jiangsu province from the period of june  to may  the company decided to cease operating this branch because we did not have many sales from this branch and we did not have enough cash to support its operations as of september   jilin huamei also conducts the purchase of grapes from the open market for the production of our own wine hong kong huaxia international industrial co ltd hong kong huaxia  sells health products and specialized local goods  hong kong huaxia was incorporated by us on march   as a whollyowned subsidiary to sell health products and specialized local goods the registered capital of hong kong huaxia is hkd  approximately  which has not been funded by the company hong kong huaxia began operations in april  on september   the company established a new wholly owned subsidiary of hong kong huaxia jilin huaxia ginseng co ltd jilin huaxia our products previously through yanbian huaxing we focused on the farming processing distribution and marketing of asian and american ginseng and related byproducts in the following varieties  fresh ginseng for pharmaceutical health supplement cosmetic industry and fresh consumption  dry ginseng dried form for pharmaceutical and health supplement consumption  ginseng seeds selling of ginseng seeds  ginseng seedling selling of ginseng seedling also through yanbian huaxing we obtained year leases to  acres of land approved by the local government for ginseng growing on june   and we have developed  of the land resources since august  we have gradually shifted our business focus from direct sales of ginseng and ginseng byproducts to the production and sale of canned ginseng juice and wine we have started reserving most of the ginseng produced by yanbian huaxing for use in the planned production of canned ginseng juice and grape juice produced by tonghua linyuan for use in the production of wine meanwhile as there is a higher standard for ginseng used in canned ginseng juice we are able to sell some of the ginseng produced by yanbian huaxing which is not qualified for use in canned ginseng juice to the market through yanbian huaxing although we have shifted our business focus to the production and sale of ginseng juice and wine we still receive orders for ginseng and its byproducts because of our reputation in the industry for selling highquality ginseng we intend to maintain this part of our business even though it is no longer our business focus in addition if we receive large orders for ginseng andor ginseng byproducts we will directly purchase ginseng andor ginseng byproducts from the market if we can get a lower price of the products this part of sale of ginseng is generated on an ordertoorder basis and conditioned on whether we can get a lower price for such demanded products in the market through jilin ganzhi we produce two types of canned ginseng juice  ganzhi asian ginseng beverage  ganzhi american ginseng beverage in addition to canned ginseng juice we also shifted our business to wine production prior to the sale of the assets and debts of tonghua linyuan we grew and crushed the grapes from our vineyards and had the juice reserved in the future we will purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine and grape juice we contracted with jinyuanshan winery for the final production and bottling of the wine and commenced wine production through jinyuanshan winery in march  and sales in april  all of our wines are sold through jinlin huamei and hong kong huaxia we produce and sell three types of wine  bingqing ice wine  pearl in the snow red wine  linyuan hong wine red wine new focus of our business canned ginseng juice to produce canned ginseng juice we take ginseng juice extracted from fresh ginseng as the main material and add natural extracts like xylitol citric acid and steviosides as subsidiary ingredients we have farming technicians periodically inspect farmers to ensure they follow our growing guidelines to control the quality of the fresh ginseng and when we need to purchase fresh ginseng from the market for production of ginseng juice we limit our choice to the highest quality of fresh ginseng we use low residue pesticide and biodegradable fertilizer for ginseng planting we use xylitol instead of sugar to lower calories which also does not cause products to have a sour taste currently there are about  kinds of ginseng drinks on the market all of them are imported from korea based on our market research the price range for those products is rmb  to rmb  per can about  the most important component of ginseng is ginsenoside based upon reading our competitors product labels all of their ginseng drinks are blended after extracting ginsenosides through chemical methods the chemical extraction of ginsenosides will cause damage to its nutritional components our technology is different from the traditional method used by our competitors we squeezeout the natural juice from fresh ginseng so as to preserve freshness and nutrition in the final product squeezing is not commonly used in canned ginseng juice because it requires fresh ginseng the preservation of which is very difficult fresh ginseng rots very fast the harvest time concentrates in september and october which is a fairly short period after that one can only buy dried ginseng from the market such as sundried ginseng from which we cannot squeeze juice however our drink formula uses refrigerated ginseng as a raw material to produce canned ginseng juice which enables us to maintain its freshness and nutrition in our final products the drink formula for our ginseng beverages is a registered patent approved by the chinese government patent number zl  this patent was issued on january   and expires  years after issuance this is the reason we store our fresh ginseng in refrigerated warehouse space we are currently renting a refrigerated warehouse  degrees celsius to store all fresh ginseng inventory necessary for production of the ginseng beverages monthly rent for refrigerated warehouse is rmb  about  we commenced production in august  and sales in october  which was reflected in our financial statement for the three months ending december   we initiated our sales of canned ginseng juice in china and we plan to expand our business to overseas markets in  or  our ganzhi ginseng beverage costs approximately  per  ml bottle and our american ginseng beverage costs approximately  per  ml bottle however as we are in the initial stage of the ginseng beverage business we cannot assure the demands for our ginseng beverage will be profitable in the short term and there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate the revenue from ginseng beverage business we own the production plant for ginseng juice the plant is certified by the chinese government as a good manufacturing process facility which is required for our production of these products good manufacturing process standards cover organization and personnel building and facilities equipment materials hygiene and sanitation validation documentation production management quality management production distribution and recall complaints and adverse reactions report and selfinspections wine our grapes grow on  acres of land leased from a group of individual farmers paying approximately  per acre a year for  years this lease expires on december   however recent harvests from our vineyard showed poor quality indicating the vineyard is no longer suitable for the production of wine we decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes and not to renew the lease of the land when it expires we will now purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine we started production of wine in march  and sales in april  through tonghua linyuan we have a written production agreement with tonghua jinyuanshan winery jinyuanshan winery to produce pearl in snow wine and bingqing ice wine for us from may   to may   pursuant to the sale of all assets and liabilities of tonghua linyuan on june   the contract with jinyuanshan winery was fulfilled by our subsidiary jilin huamei under the terms of the agreement we provide jinyuanshan winery with grape juice bottling supplies and packaging supplies and jinyuanshan winery produces and bottles the wine with a charge of approximately  per bottle approximately  a bottle for processing red wine and approximately  per bottle for processing ice wine we have another written production agreement with jinyuanshan winery through tonghua linyuan replaced by jilin huamei since june   to produce linyuan hong wine for us at a charge of approximately  per bottle from may   to may   the agreement contains similar terms as the production written agreement we have with jinyuanshan winery for producing pearl in snow wine and bingqing ice wine distribution we intend to recruit one general distributor for our products of ginseng beverage and wine in every city in china through jilin huamei the city level distributor can recruit the second level distributors in addition to recruiting general distributors in some major cities jilin huamei will establish sale branch offices to facilitate the local sales our direct sales will target customers of highend retailers such as supermarkets pharmacies hotels gift shops entertainment centers tourists attractions airport and highspeed trains etc we started negotiating distribution and sales agreements with potential general distributors we are using the same distribution agreement for our general distributors although specific terms might differ based upon negotiations we have with each distributor in specific regard to our ginseng juice business we have signed five  distributors through jilin huamei as of the date of this filing as for the distribution of our wine we have signed one  distributor through jilin huamei as of the date of this filing in addition as a part of our adjustment to our marketing strategy for our ginseng juice and wine we established hong kong huaxia in march  hong kong huaxia recruits distributors to sell wine and ginseng juice outside of china in asia markets and to build and maintain an online shopping platform through which to take orders directly from end user customers in addition we plan to open online shop via taobao the biggest online bc and cc platform in asia a subsidiary of alibaba because taobao requires business to have a domestic address we set up jinlin huaxia a subsidiary of hong kong huaxia which is located in jinlin china competitive environment the market for ginseng products and wine is highly competitive our operations may be affected by technological advances by competitors industry consolidation patents granted to competitors competitive combination products new products offered by our competitors as well as new information provided by other marketed products andor other postmarket studies critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including the allowance for doubtful accounts the saleability and recoverability of inventory income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions in addition past financial results are not indicative of future performance due to our emphasis on further commercializing ginseng juice with our crops as raw materials and broadening our offering such as wine sale furthermore we cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations we assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary consolidated
