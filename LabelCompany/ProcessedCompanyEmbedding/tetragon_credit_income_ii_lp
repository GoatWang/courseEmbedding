greenoak in which tfg holds a minority interest is not currently included in the calculation of pro forma ebitda ebitda during q  tfg asset managements ebitda was  million resulting in a yeartodate  ebitda equivalent of  million whilst tracking below ebitda for the equivalent period in  the shortfall in  has decreased from over  million at the end of h  to  million at the end of q  with growth in performance and success fees driving this change in addition as was observed in the half yearly report management fees in  now account for a greater percentage of total income than they did in the prior year we believe that this is an indication of an improvement in the quality of the earnings year on year management fee income management fee income continued to increase year on year as shown in figure  in particular fee income generated in the equitix business grew as capital was put to work thereby earning full fees and feepaying aum was increased in new fund vehicles performance and success fees performance and success fees have grown period on period primarily reflecting the positive performance across the polygon hedge funds which has led to a marked increase in unrealised performance fees the other main component of this category is primary fee income from the equitix business which is close to but slightly behind the equivalent period in  other fee income this category includes a number of different income streams including third party clo management fee income relating to certain us clo  transactions this stream continued to decline as expected as these transactions amortised down in addition this category includes certain cost recoveries from tfg relating to seeded polygon hedge funds the cost recoveries which are described in more detail in the tfg asset management overview section of this report decreased year on year although the teams supporting those seeded funds continued to grow as these businesses mature and build thirdparty capital we expect that such cost recoveries should decrease the other fee income category also includes fee income generated by equitix on certain management services contracts which grew year on year operating expenses this category of expenses was  million higher than the equivalent period in  reflecting a number of different factors firstly tcip is a new and growing business which was not recording any material level of expenses during the comparable period in  secondly equitix continues to grow its business including the management services segment resulting in an increase in both costs as and revenues finally tfg asset management continued to invest by increasing headcount in a number of areas which will support any continued growth of the platform business overviews the following pages

using  a  thirdparty  cash  flow  modelling  tool  the  model contains certain assumption inputs that are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate to factor in how historic current and potential market developments examined through for example forward looking observable data might impact the performance of tfgs clo equity investments  since this involves modelling among other things forward projections over multiple years this is not an exercise in recalibrating future assumptions to the latest quarters historical data subject to the foregoing when determining the us gaapcompliant fair value of tfgs portfolio the company seeks to derive a value at which market participants could transact in an orderly market and also seeks to benchmark the model inputs and resulting outputs to observable market data when available and appropriate the below modelling assumptions are unchanged from last quarter figure  us clos modelling assumption us clos modelling assumption variable year

investment companies the guide as an investment company tfg  carries all of its investments at fair value  however as outlined in section  of the guide operating entities should be consolidated where tfg i has an economic interest in excess of  ii is deemed to have control over the significant operational and financial decisions of the entity and iii where the purpose of the operating entity is to provide services to the investment company ie tfg rather than realise a gain on the sale of the investment  as at  september  this consolidation exemption was applied to tfgs holdings in polygon lcm hawkes point and tcip the consolidated businesses because these businesses were managing some of tfgs investment capital and thus could be deemed to be providing services to tfg  in contrast equitix is not managing tfgs capital so is not subject to point iii above and greenoak is minorityowned so is not subject to points i or ii above the resultant inconsistency of treatment under us gaap of the businesses in tfg asset management is potentially confusing to the reader of tfgs financial statements particularly since the determination and articulation in q  of the ipo strategy for tfg asset management which confirmed that the primary commercial purpose for tfg asset management including the consolidated businesses is to be held as an investment for capital appreciation in line with tfgs investment objective  consequently from q  tfg has prepared and presented its nongaap financial metrics and performance information using a consistent fair value basis for all of tfg asset management  some of the differences resulting from the presentation of nongaap metrics are reconciled in appendix iv tfgs investments in the tfg asset management businesses are considered to be level  investments in the us gaap valuation hierarchy and the audit committee of tfg comprising the independent directors has engaged thirdparty valuation specialists to determine an indicative valuation for each of these businesses  these valuations have been adopted for the purposes of reporting the fair value impact in tfgs nongaap metrics as at  september  figure  sets out the valuation approach utilised for each of the businesses as well as the range of market metrics utilised in determining fair value  both management and performance fees collectively the fees continue to be calculated based on the us

equitybased compensation plans in q  tfg implemented an equitybased longterm incentive plan for certain senior employees of tfg asset management excluding the principals of tfm awards under the longterm incentive plan along with other equitybased awards are typically spread over multiple vesting dates up to  which may vary for each employee and are subject to forfeiture provisions  the arrangements may also include additional periods beyond the vesting dates during which employees gain exposure to the performance of the tfg shares but the shares are not issued to the employees  such periods may range from one to five years beyond the vesting dates  the shares underlying these equitybased incentive programs typically will be held in escrow until they vest and will be eligible to receive shares under the tfg optional stock dividend plan drip shares where grants under these equitybased incentive programs will only be settled through the issuance of shares rather than through cash and in accordance with us gaap rules for sharebased compensation tfg has elected to account for equitybased plans under asc  – equitybased payments to employees – and is applying the straightline method for expense recognition and for calculating the share dilution effect  this means that the total expense of the initial awards is determined at the award date or at the date that the award becomes eligible to be settled only in shares award date by applying a reference share price on the award date to the shares awarded  taking into account all equitybased awards granted to tfg asset management employees including the q  ltip awards approximately  million shares have been awarded at a weighted average reference share price of  per share implying a total sharebased compensation charge of approximately  million spread over a period of up to eight years excluding employerrelated taxes the dilutive effect of the equitybased compensation plans will be reflected increasingly in tfgs fully diluted share count over the life of the plans  such dilution will include among other things and in addition to the award shares any drip shares and shares that will be required to cover employer taxes  at the end of q  approximately  million shares were included in the fully diluted share count appendix viii additional clo portfolio statistics figure  tetragon financial group limited

be service providers to tfg  for the quarter ending  september  tfg began reporting its key performance metrics on a fair value basis that adjusts us gaap metrics to include the fair value of the tfg asset management businesses that are currently consolidated under us gaap  the fair values used are as determined by tfgs audit committee based on information provided by an independent valuation specialist prepared in accordance with asc   the consistent use of fair value across all investments is referred to in this report as fair value  fair value key metrics such as fair value nav per

gaap investment company accounting for tfgs financial statements and used as the basis for the calculation of fees  please refer to appendices iii and iv for further details  during the third quarter of  tfg determined in consultation with its auditors and nonaudit accounting advisors that based on the relative growth of its investments in tfg asset management businesses tfg may be unable to continue satisfying the requirements for investment company reporting under us gaap for future reporting periods including potentially with respect to the current reporting year which would result in significantly more investments being consolidated under us gaap and over time a greater disparity between the us gaap and fair value performance metrics  however tfg has further determined in consultation with its auditors and nonaudit accounting advisors that tfg would satisfy the requirements for investment entity reporting under the international financial reporting standards ifrs a change to which would result in all or substantially all of tfgs investments being held at fair value such that the disparity between ifrs and fair value performance metrics would be significantly less than the expected disparity between us gaap and fair value performance metrics for future periods  as such tfg is actively considering a potential change in its accounting principles from us gaap to ifrs with any such change being initially reflected in our annual report for  and requiring the restatement of certain reports for prior periods to ifrs  any change in accounting principles could result in differences in the presentation and basis of reporting between tfgs reporting for future periods under ifrs and its reporting for prior periods under us gaap limiting the comparability of reports for these periods and may also result in the accrual and payment of the incentive fees described above that are included in the calculations of the fair value key metrics but have not yet arisen under the current us gaap investment company accounting for tfgs financial statements  tfgs assessment of this potential change in accounting principles is ongoing and there can be no assurance as to what if any change will ultimately be made vii nav per share based on tfgs financial statements as of  september   please note that the reported nav per share excludes any shares held in
