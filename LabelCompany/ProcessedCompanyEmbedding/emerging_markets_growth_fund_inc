investing stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions international investing involves special risks including but not limited to currency fluctuations illiquidity and volatility these risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations which adversely affect returns in addition many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity nondiversification of investments means that more assets are potentially invested in fewer securities than if investments were diversified so risk is increased because each investment has a greater effect on performance the fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility shortselling entails special risks if the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value the fund will lose value any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing shortsale proceeds in other investments performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that

yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the funds nav at the end of the period some blackrock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields there is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary

throughout the developing world as markets have evolved but our approach has remained the same since the inception of our strategy more than  years ago most analysts at capital have made research their careers establishing longstanding relationships with key corporate managers and policymakers over the course of several business and market cycles we thoroughly analyze the prospects of each company regardless of its market index weighting gathering information from onsite visits in order to determine each company’s business prospects management and competitive position within a local and global context we aim to fully understand the social economic cultural and political factors that contribute to the longterm outlook for each company as well as the markets and industries within which they operate for example investments in materials energy and technology companies may be based on research by several dedicated emerging markets analysts combined with extensive discussion among developedmarket analysts fixedincome and macroeconomic analysts and several managers all looking at similar data points from different perspectives these exchanges also help identify the best ways to invest in longerterm trends such as infrastructure development urban growth and growing consumer demand in the emerging markets we have a comprehensive framework for addressing risk our research process and the capital system help diversify the portfolio capital’s independent global investment control group monitors compliance with portfolio guidelines our legal and compliance team helps make certain we adhere to regulations in the markets in which we invest learn more about the capital advantage history of emerging markets equity at capital group capital’s first emerging markets equity fund was launched in  more than one year prior to the inception of the msci emerging markets index we continue to have one of the largest dedicated emerging markets research efforts in the investment
