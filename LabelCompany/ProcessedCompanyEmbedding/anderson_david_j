devel hi im a software developer ive been writing software professionally for more than  years now one of my favorite books about the practice of software development for business is extreme programming explained by kent beck  which refreshingly upended a lot of conventional wisdom about software development focusing effort on activities that add value for customers in the intervening years many of the practices promoted in that book have become commonplace mostly notably test driven development extreme programming itself never really got much traction but many of its ideas were taken up by a family of practices more generally known as agile agile itself remains somewhat controversial while also becoming so general that its not quite clear what it means anymore scrum the most popular flavour of agile took a lot of the extreme programming practices for organizing teams and placed emphasis on commitment scrumstyle sprints are commonplace you guys all know this stuff though i dont know why im even typing itso this is the environment that produced kanban which is a fusion of agile methods and lean management principles the last place i worked used some scrum but honestly most of the management wasnt really uptospeed on the finer points of scrum and tended to rely on experience and organizational inertia to set policies so its hard to say that what we were doing was scrum compared to that environment however i see a lot to like in kanban a basic principle of kanban is that workinprogress is limited to a fixed number of items in order to reduce complexity and increase the predictability of delivery and therefore shorten lead times one of the effects of this is to highlight bottlenecks as it is plain to everyone exactly where in the process work is piling up then idle resources that is people can change processes to help work to move through the bottleneck more quickly this kanban book takes extremely high quality as measured in defects and test coverage as something of a given and focuses on work exactly one level up from there it is assume that the dev team knows how to do their work but that they are in danger of being tasked with too much unimportant work the author discusses what happens on teams very little and devotes a lot of space to how work is prioritized between different groups within an organizationtalking about all of this with a helpful colleague recently he pointed out that all of these methodologies require organizations to have discipline managers from toptobottom have to be able to make plans and follow through on them and tirelessly ensure that their efforts align with customer needs if you can do that you will be able to implement any of the agile methodologies with success without it you cant implement anything i can see how something like kanban can be used to gradually increase trust and communication in an organization until that kind of discipline is achieved but ive never ever seen this actually happen does it ever happeni dont mean any of this to be negative though theres a lot to like in kanban anderson dispenses with estimation of tasks by and large replacing it with statistical averages for a given team he says a development task will take between n and m days p percent of the time eg from  to  days  of the time which is really all the information a management team needs for planning if lead times are short enough anderson also eliminates iterations or sprints which made sense when integration and deployment and planning of the next unit of work were expensive activities decoupling deployment from features completion and planning enables a continuous development cadence anderson also emphasizes trust instead of commitment a great deal of the success of a kanban team seems to stem from the ability of the team to selforganize based on the visualization of the flow of work and the policiesseparating kanban the methodology from the book for a moment well i think

the writing can be a bit dull the examples a bit too verbose but this book contains a thorough description of kanban one of the newer techniques for agile software managementkanban for software development descends from the broader lean traditions that have been gaining greater prominence in the world of agile software lean in general and kanban in particular focuses on the idea that there is not one best process that works for all teams as such kanban is not a software development methodology  it is a change management methodology the tools of kanban help teams figure out how they can customize their processes to improve their performance kanban flips the question from how can we get more done to what is blocking our ability to get more doneat the heart of kanban although not sufficient on its own is work in progress limits limiting the work in progress to get more done may seem counterintuitive the value of these limits flow from the assumption that the gains to be had from improving the process are greater than the productivity lost by not having everyone fully loaded all of the time this plays out in several waysfirst limiting the work in progress forces teams to acknowledge the parts of their process that are bottlenecks without strict limits the parts of the process that are not bottlenecks can keep taking on more and more work causing it to pile up once it gets to the bottleneck with strict limits the problems become obviouslimiting the work in progress forces teams to deal with blocked work items without strict limits it is easy to let blockers delay the completion of a task for a long time first the part of the team not responsible for the task is not motivated to deal with the blocker because they can just ignore it second the task owner may also not deal with the block as quickly as they might otherwise because they have other tasks to work on when the work in progress is limited blocks have to be addressedlimiting the work in progress optimizes for latency over throughput many teams aim to get tasks done as quickly as possible in practice urgent but not necessarily more important items tend to jump into the work queue as soon as they come up and people juggle multiple projects limiting the work in progress forces a conversation about priorities do we have to take on this task right away or can it be on the top of our list of things to tackle next if we have to work on it right away and were already working at our limit what can we drop note that this sort of dropping is already common at an individual level however its not necessarily communicated to the team or the external stakeholders which leads to mismatched expectations about when work will get donefinally limiting parallel work decreases task switching overhead both at the individual and team level at the individual level too much parallelism can make people feel overwhelmed too much varies from person to person but everyone has a limit at the team level too much parallelism fragments knowledge andor leads to higher communication overhead since people have to share a larger amount of context whenever they solicit input from someone working an unrelated taskof course just limiting the work in progress on its own does not make things better the bulk of andersons book describes other concepts needed to effectively monitor and improve a development process a mature kanban system has a lot of pieces  pieces that can make it look a lot like a development process  but the key to remember is that these mature systems developed by adding and tweaking and removing process as it was shown to be needed by the problems they had in practice while teams with a mature process derived using kanban may have some similar best practices part of the power of this system is making sure that those practices evolved based on the needs of the team these practices shouldnt be adopted without thought  and if they are theyll likely fail more flag
