kred our kreds use nicotinamide cofactors as electron donors to reduce carbonyls to alcohols most codexis kreds are capable of recycling the cofactor with the aid of isopropanol ipa generating acetone which can be readily removed from the reaction some kreds require the use of a glucoseglucose dehydrogenase gdh system for cofactor recycling to meet this need codexis supplies stable and economical gdhs “offtheshelf” transaminases ata our atas are versatile enzymes that use isopropylamine as an amine donor to convert ketones to chiral amines in one step the resulting byproduct is acetone which can be stripped from the reaction mixture thereby driving the reaction to the side of the amine codexis developed the first rselective ata that tolerated larger substituents on both sides of the substrate carbonyl imine reductases ired our ireds have been engineered to exhibit totally novel intermolecular reductive amination activity on unactivated substrates the ireds catalyze the formation of secondary and tertiary amines through the coupling of amines with carbonyls to form imines and their subsequent reduction they enable the biocatalytic implementation of the highly versatile and synthetically useful reductive animation reaction and can provide access to complex amine products in a single step nitrilases nit nitrilases are useful enzymes capable of hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids at neutral ph and ambient temperature they are stereoselective and in some cases also generate amide intermediates baeyervilliger monooxygenases bvmo our bvmos have been developed for asymmetric sulfoxidation using ambient oxygen as the oxidant because this reaction requires a nicotinamide cofactor a kred and isopropanol or a gdh and glucose are added to the system to recycle the cofactor the relevant kred or gdh are available from codexis monoamine oxidases maos our maos use ambient oxygen as an oxidant providing a safe and mild way to generate imines from amines our maos have proven useful in the desymmetrization of bicyclic pyrrolidine compounds in the synthesis of hepatitis c drugs halohydrin dehalogenases hhdh our hhdh platform was developed for the production of ethyl r−cyanohydroxybutyrate the first chiral building block in the synthesis of the atorvastatin side chain these enzymes generate epoxides from halohydrins and in turn open epoxides with certain nucleophiles ene reductases ered ereds are capable of reducing carboncarbon double bonds using a nicotinamide cofactor as the electron donor a kredipa or gdhglucose system can be used for cofactor regeneration the relevant kred or gdh are available from codexis acylases acy our acylase platform is derived from penicillin g acylase the acy variants are highly selective and have improved activity and stability over the native enzyme microcyps® mcyp® our mcyp® enzymes provide medicinal chemists with exclusive and unique tools to produce metabolites and generate potentially new leads our bacterial cytochrome p cyps variants contain mutations that result in robust biocatalysts with higher productivity over mammalian cyps our variants are capable of producing most human metabolites as well as novel compounds these enzymes are readily scalable to produce gram quantities of desired products     inquiries   for any inquiries on our products or services please contact codexis via email

sales were recorded at gross margins that exceed our guidance range for the year said codexis president and ceo john nicols  these results show our continued execution toward a third consecutive year of translating our protein catalyst and enzyme pipeline into sustained product sales growth product sales were again led by deliveries to merck as well as significant aggregate sales to several generic pharmaceutical customers additionally we shipped a large order that advanced the timeline for switching the manufacturing process of another major pharmaceutical companys patented commercially available drug to use our proprietary protein catalyst we have delivered a number of strategic successes yeartodate he added  first on the list is the signing of our second multiyear agreement with tate  lyle we have already staffed the research project for improving their target food ingredient process and received a payment in the low singledigit million dollar range which we will start to recognize in the second quarter second we filed our first patent application and began beta testing the first codexisdeveloped enzyme for the molecular diagnostics industry we also welcomed new

ability to identify trends in what management considers to be codexis core operating results and to better understand how management evaluates the business these nongaap measures have limitations however because they do not include all items of expense that affect codexis these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with and should not be considered in isolation of or as an

provide nongaap information which excludes depreciation expense related to the depreciation of property and equipment we believe that eliminating this expense from our nongaap measures is useful to investors because the acquisition of property and equipment and the corresponding depreciation expense can be inconsistent in amount and can vary from period to period b intangible asset amortization we provide nongaap information which excludes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets which primarily relate to purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we believe that eliminating this expense from our nongaap measures is useful to investors because this expense is noncash this financial measure may be different from nongaap methods of accounting and reporting used by the companys competitors to the extent their nongaap measures include or exclude other items the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share or other measures prepared in accordance with gaap c stockbased compensation we provide nongaap information which excludes expenses for stockbased compensation we believe the exclusion of this item allows for financial results that are more indicative of our operations we also believe that the exclusion of stockbased compensation expense provides for a better comparison of codexis operating results to prior periods as the calculations of stockbased compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies
