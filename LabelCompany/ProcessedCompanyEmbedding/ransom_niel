report that is given to every malware threat that has been collected and analyzed through our malware research center the esg threat scorecard evaluates and ranks each threat by using several metrics such as trends incidents and severity over time in addition to the effective scoring for each threat we are able to interpret anonymous geographic data to list the top three countries infected with a particular threat the data used for the esg threat scorecard is updated daily and displayed based on trends for a day period the esg threat scorecard is a useful tool for a wide array of computer users from end users seeking a solution to remove a particular threat or security experts pursuing analysis and research data on emerging threats each of the fields listed on the esg threat scorecard containing a specific value are as follows ranking the current ranking of a particular threat among all the other threats found on our malware research database threat level the level of threat a particular pc threat could have on an infected computer the threat level is based on a particular threats behavior and other risk factors we rate the threat level as low medium or high the different threat levels are discussed in the spyhunter risk assessment model infected pcs the number of confirmed and suspected cases of a particular threat detected on infected pcs retrieved from diagnostic and scan log reports generated by spyhunters spyware scanner  change the daily percent change in the frequency of infected pcs of a specific threat the formula for percent changes results from current trends of a specific threat an increase in the rankings of a specific threat yields a recalculation of the percentage of its recent gain when a specific threats ranking decreases the percentage rate reflects its recent decline for a specific threat remaining unchanged the percent change remains in its current state the  change data is calculated and displayed in three different date ranges in the last  hours  days and  days next to the percentage change is the trend movement a specific malware threat does either upward or downward in the rankings each level of movement is color coded a green uparrow ∧ indicates a rise a red downarrow ∨ indicates a decline and a brown equal symbol  indicates no change or plateaued top  countries infected lists the top three countries a particular threat

i cant delete the app and i cannot deactivate the app if i do it it will come again in my screen george piche  year ago my computer was infected with the cryptowall ransomware virus spyhunter was able to remove the infection in full after a remote session with one of their technicians unfortunately i was unable to recover my files as the virus deleted all shadow files or previous restore points sadly i didn’t do a recent backup and lost several files thanks to spyhunter i’m back up and running though very satisfied with their software and technical support top notch if anyone has any other information on how i might be able to recovery encrypted files please advise referred to all the links provided by spyhunter support but no luck aside from paying the ransom i’m open to suggestions thanks missionimpossible  years ago my computer is infected by cryptowall i tried different free tools to decrypt my files but nothing helped… so i had to pay  to recover my files it took about

to know please someone let me know and i’ll fix them the old fashioned way abegail  years ago my pc got infected and i just want to ask if this malware propagates only if there’s an internet

the trashdesperate john smith  years ago got infected with this virus i have deleted all files and programs and its still fukd this is just a scam and anyone who pays the ransom is obviously nuts looks like a full wipe it is my mate does it for a tenner sweet as i hope the people who designed this virus die a slow painfull death jon  years ago the virus hit one pc and of course encrypted as much as it had access too but nobody let us know we’re an outsourced it support company so it had all yesterday afternoon to worm its way around and this morning i just wanted to get something clear is the program local to one machine’s available places to access or once its gotten to as far as it can on the server through that first user’s machine can it jump across to other users’ machines start the executable from there and then get more access or is it only local to the machine the virus hit terri  years ago found that some files can be recovered by right clicking and choosing previous versions only do this after running a full antivirus scan otherwiseanything that this computer touches will get infected do not attach usb drives while infected seb  years ago pleaseee got any solution to the encrypted files says the virus makes copies of original and deletes but nor can seek recovery programs dolmac d’ ont work your solution tori  years ago my laptop primary computer was infected december  i had an it person take a look…new security softwarehardware was installed and my files and photos are all gone the consumer product safety commission or somebody needs to prevent this custo  years ago you must have really needed those files to pay the ransom concerned  years ago did paying the ransom work triton  years ago the latest version of cryptowall wipes out all your files wholesale the only way to have your files back is by using data recovery softwares or better yet from an external source tim s  years ago to richard carry you say you were able to decrypt the files exactly how my mother’s computer was hit – oct   for those whose are ‘adamant’ about not paying to having them decrypted obviously haven’t lost years of files that include financial family history personal files we would be more than willing to pay but a service tech wipe the computer clean of the virus before we realized the only way to get them decrypted was to pay them now we have over  encrypted useless files we had the files backup on an external hard drive that was connected to the computer the virus hit that too victim too  years ago paying these thieves is like negotiating with terrorists if you pay you’re only making things worse and you’re voluntarily inviting them into your computer to make things worse down the road plus you’re wearing a target since they know you’ve paid before… you’ll keep paying again these people will eventually get caught don’t be a part of the problem thai  years ago should i go ahead paying the cryptowall if i pay what are the chance of decrypt my file richard carey  years ago i have seen this trojan first hand once the original file is not deleted so you cannot recover deleted files to get yourself out of trouble i can’t believe that some of you have talked to a number of it specialists and they have told you to pay the ransom i have recovered the files twice that were encrypted by cryptowall once locally the second time across the globe deb s  years ago i got the virus last night i have an image backup from an external drive but it does not include all files as i save some files directly to a nd drive unfortunately this drive was connected last night when i got the virus and it also got the virus my virus software it dept says that it seems to just be malware that encrypts the files and deletes the original my dilemma is that i need to try to recover the files on the external drive – is this possible shannon  years ago omg so good joe  years ago have there been any positive results in retrieving the data left on the hard drive i have been infected on a windows  machine bokchoy  years ago windows  has previous file options which you may be able to go back to… otherwise if you don’t have backups you’re sol unless you want to pay  extortion to get the decrypt ability in response to the article the exe file created seems to be random the one i saw had a different random string of charactors for a name i’ve seen cryptolocker before and cryptolocker appeared to act faster or more efficiently i’m working on clean up now and there’s directories that have some files encrypted whereas others are not so i’m confused as to whether i just got to it in time or what for any average user sorry if you’ve gotten infected  is a bit much for most people but if you don’t have back ups that’s the only current way to get your files back in the future keep backups on a device that’s not left connected to your computer dolmac  years ago here is how to recover your files the ransomware function this way  when a user launch it usually by email it will encrypt all their files and add in each directory a document explaining that they will have to pay in bitcoin  to recover their files fyi if you pay you will actually recover your files but is there another solution than paying  or  to some kind of mafia  yes  poweroff the machine  the faster the better cryptowall operate this way  first it will do a copy of your original file and encrypt it with what they claim to be a rsa key then it will delete the original files it goes on until it encrypted all files on all disks and network shares the user can access in a second time it will try to delete any windows shadowcopies of your files to prevent you to recover a previous quotunencryptedquot version of your files the reason you should power off the machine quickly is that it might prevent the suppression of shadowcopies then all you have to do is power on the machine press f launch it in safe mode and use antimalware programs to clean the virus then use the quotprecedent versionquot tab on properties of your user folders to recover unencrypted files  what if you have no shadow copies and no backup of your files  there is still a way as i said cryptowall doesn’t encrypt your original files it will do a copy of it encrypt it and delete the original file as you probably know a deleted file can be recover if nothing as been written over it on your disk good think you quickly power off the machine soon after the infection  now all you have to do is take your hard drive out put it in another machine as external drive or second drive if you don’t have a sata dock an run a file recovery program i use ontrack easyrecovery or rstudio or even datarescue for mac the pro version of ontrack easyrecovery might also be able to recover files from a raid array if one of your network share as been encrypted and you don’t have backups all these programs will be able to recover the original files deleted by cryptowall just make sure when you run those to not do it directly on the original machine as by writing on your infected disk the program could overwrite your deleted files you should be able to recover  of your files using this method after you recover your files always do a clean format  install of your machine of course the best way to protect you from this kind of virus is always the same  have a backup always and a good
